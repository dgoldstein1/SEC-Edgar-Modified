              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


Note 1. Basis of Presentation

   The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets,
statements of operations and cash flows reflect all adjustments, consisting of
normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments as explained in Note 2--
Business Combinations, that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a
fair presentation of the financial position of VeriSign, Inc. and its
subsidiaries, (VeriSign or the Company), at September 30, 2000, and the results
of operations and cash flows for the interim periods ended September 30, 2000
and 1999.

   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore,
do not include all information and notes normally provided in audited financial
statements and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of
the Company for the year ended December 31, 1999 included in the annual report
previously filed on Form 10-K. In addition, we recently acquired Network
Solutions, Inc., (Network Solutions). Network Solutions previously filed
audited financial statements for the three-year period ended December 31, 1999
in its 1999 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative, nor comparable to the results of operations for any other interim
period or for a full fiscal year. Prior periods have been reclassified for
comparative purposes.

   The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, investments, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable approximate their respective fair values.

Note 2. Business Combinations

 THAWTE Consulting (Pty) Ltd. Acquisition

   On February 1, 2000, VeriSign completed its acquisition of THAWTE Consulting
(Pty) Ltd., or THAWTE, a privately held South African company that provides
digital certificates to website owners and software developers. VeriSign issued
approximately 4.4 million shares of its common stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of THAWTE. The acquisition has been accounted for as a
purchase and, accordingly, the total purchase price of approximately $652
million has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
the liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values on the
acquisition date. Goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over two to three years. THAWTE's results of operations
have been included in the consolidated financial statements from its date of
acquisition.

 Signio, Inc. Acquisition

   On February 29, 2000, VeriSign completed its acquisition of Signio, Inc., or
Signio, a privately held company that provides payment services that connect
online merchants, business-to-business exchanges, payment processors and
financial institutions on the Internet. VeriSign issued approximately 5.6
million shares of its common stock in exchange for all the outstanding shares
of Signio and also assumed all of Signio's outstanding stock options. The
acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the total
purchase price of approximately $876 million has been allocated to the tangible
and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their
respective fair values on the acquisition date. Goodwill and other intangible
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years. Signio's
results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial
statements from its date of acquisition.

 Network Solutions, Inc. Acquisition

   On June 8, 2000, VeriSign completed its acquisition of Network Solutions, a
publicly traded company that provides Internet domain name registration and
global registry services. The total consideration of approximately $19.6
billion was based on: the fair value of VeriSign's common stock issued; stock
options assumed; and merger related costs. At the closing, VeriSign issued
approximately 78.3 million shares of its common stock valued at approximately
$18.0 billion, based on an exchange ratio of 1.075 shares of VeriSign's common
stock for each outstanding share of Network Solutions common stock. VeriSign
assumed outstanding options to purchase Network Solutions common stock, which
were converted into options to acquire approximately 9.1 million shares of
VeriSign's common stock, with a fair value of approximately $1.6 billion, based
on the same exchange ratio, subject to terms and conditions, including
exercisability and vesting schedules, of the original options.

   As part of the purchase price, VeriSign recorded a provision for merger
related costs of $96.4 million. Merger related costs are incremental and non-
recurring expenses. Merger related costs are necessary to integrate Network
Solutions and VeriSign. The provision is associated with the activities of
integration teams responsible for merging the two companies and includes such
items as investment banker fees, legal fees, filing fees, provision for
acceleration of stock option vesting, and employee relocation expenses. For the
period from June 8, 2000 to June 30, 2000, approximately $8.9 million was paid
for filing fees, legal fees and consulting fees related to the acquisition. An
additional $7.9 million was recorded against the provision in the third quarter
for the write-off of duplicative information systems and prepaid director and
officer insurance premiums. It is anticipated that further amounts will be
expended over the course of the next nine months.

   This transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Accordingly, the purchase
consideration of $19.6 billion has been preliminarily allocated to the
estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on
their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Goodwill and
other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over
useful lives of three to four years. Network Solutions results of operations
have been included in the consolidated financial statements from its date of
acquisition.

 Purchase Price Allocations

   The purchase consideration for THAWTE, Signio and Network Solutions was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values

 Purchased In-Process Research and Development

   The portion of the Network Solutions purchase price allocated to in-process
research and development ("IPR&D") was $54 million and was expensed during the
quarter ended June 30, 2000. Network Solution's IPR&D efforts focused on
significant and substantial improvements and upgrades to its shared
registration system ("SRS"). The SRS is the system that provides shared
registration interface to the accredited and licensed registrars into the .com,
 .net, and .org generic top level domain ("gTLD") name registry. It is through
this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain
names with the central database. Given the high demand on the SRS, it is in
need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability, security, non-
english language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol.

   As of the acquisition date, Network Solutions was in the process of
developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to
the SRS. The IPR&D had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses. The IPR&D under development may not achieve technical or
commercial viability. The technological feasibility of the in-process
development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all
planning, designing, coding, and testing activities that are necessary to
establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications
including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. This
estimate was based on the project costs and milestones. As of September 30,
2000, efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the SRS are continuing in
particular related to non-english language capabilities and security. These
efforts are expected to be significantly completed by the end of 2000.

   The fair value assigned to IPR&D was estimated by discounting, to present
value, the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached
technological feasibility. A discount rate consistent with the risks of the
project was used to estimate the present value of cash flows. The value
assigned to IPR&D was the amount attributable to the efforts of the seller up
to the time of acquisition. This amount was estimated through application of
the "stage of completion" calculation by multiplying the estimated present
value of future cash flows, excluding costs of completion, by the percentage of
completion of the purchased research and development project at the time of
acquisition.

Note 3. Commitments and Contingencies

   As of October 31, 2000, Network Solutions, Inc. was a defendant in seventeen
active lawsuits involving domain name disputes between trademark owners and
domain name holders. Network Solutions is drawn into such disputes, in part, as
a result of claims by trademark owners that Network Solutions is legally
required, upon request by a trademark owner, to terminate the contractual right
between Network Solutions and a domain name holder that registered a domain
name, which is alleged to be similar to the trademark in question. On October
25, 1999, however, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Network
Solutions' favor and against Lockheed Corporation, holding that Network
Solutions' services do not make Network Solutions liable for contributory
infringement to trademark owners. Thus, Network Solutions believes, this type
of suit should decline in frequency. The holders of the domain name
registrations in dispute have, in turn, questioned Network Solutions' right,
absent a court order, to take any action that affects their contractual rights
to the domain names in question. Although 82 of these kinds of situations over
the past six and a half years have resulted in suits actually naming Network
Solutions as a defendant, as of October 31, 2000, no adverse judgment has been
rendered and no award of damages has ever been made against Network Solutions.
Network Solutions believes that it has meritorious defenses and vigorously
defends itself against these claims.

   On January 13, 2000, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a
Civil Investigative Demand seeking information and documents concerning the
then-pending acquisition by VeriSign of THAWTE. VeriSign provided certain
information and documents to the Department of Justice, and closed the THAWTE
transaction on February 1, 2000. VeriSign completed its initial response to the
Civil Investigative Demand on

March 1, 2000, and a supplemental production of documents was completed May 9,
2000. On September 14, 2000, VeriSign was notified that senior officials at the
Department of Justice had reviewed a report by the investigatory staff
regarding the transaction, and that the Department had concerns about the
potential competitive effects of the transaction. Representatives of VeriSign
met with and provided additional information to the Department of Justice
during October 2000. The Department of Justice ultimately may raise objections
to the transaction that would require VeriSign to negotiate a settlement with
the Department of Justice to resolve such objections, or to defend against a
legal action challenging the transaction.

   On March 15, 2000, a group of eight plaintiffs filed suit against the United
States Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation and Network
Solutions, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California. The case, entitled William Hoefer et al. v. U.S. Department of
Commerce, et al., Civil Action No. 000918-VRW, challenged the lawfulness of the
registration fees that Network Solutions was authorized to charge for domain
name registrations from September 1995 to November 1999. The suit purports to
be brought on behalf of all domain name registrants who paid registration fees
during that period and seeks approximately $1.7 billion in damages. On June 19,
2000 the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, adding two plaintiffs
and naming VeriSign as a defendant.

   All of the defendants filed motions to transfer the suit to the Federal
District Court in the District of Columbia and the court granted those motions
on June 28, 2000. The same attorney who unsuccessfully challenged Network
Solutions in a similar action known as Thomas, et al. v. Network Solutions, et
al., filed this new action on behalf of eight former and current domain name
registrants. The suit contains eight causes of action against the defendants
based on alleged violations of Art. I, Section 8 and the Fifth Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution, the Independent Offices Appropriations Act (31 U.S.C.
Section 9701), the Administrative Procedure Act, the Sherman Act, and the
California Unfair Competition Act, Section 17200. The case was docketed with
the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia on July 28, 2000 and on
August 4, 2000 the plaintiffs dismissed the case. Four days later, the same
attorney refiled the same case in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia. Network Solutions filed a motion to dismiss the
case and the plaintiffs responded by filing a First Amended Complaint on
September 7, 2000. We now have refiled another Motion to Dismiss. The current
versions of the suit does not name VeriSign as a defendant. The suit contains
fourteen causes of action against the Appropriations Act (31 U.S.C. Section
9701), the Administrative Procedure Act, the Chief Financial Officer's Act (31
U.S.C. Section 902), and the Sherman Act. On October 10, 2000, Network
Solutions filed its motion to dismiss the case. On October 24, 2000, the
National Science Foundation filed a motion to transfer the case back to the
Federal District Court in the District of Columbia.

   On June 15, 2000, plaintiff David Moran filed a putative shareholder
derivative complaint on behalf of himself and others similarly situated against
Charles Stuckey, Jr., James Bidzos, Richard L. Earnest, Dr. Taher Elgamal,
James K. Sims, Joseph B. Lassiter III, Robert P. Badavas, and against nominal
defendant VeriSign, Inc. The case is captioned Moran v. Stuckey, et.al., No.
1810 NC (Del. Ch. 2000). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the
directors of RSA Security mismanaged RSA's business, failed to protect its
intellectual property or enforce the terms of its license agreement with
VeriSign, and that VeriSign violated the terms of the licensing agreement and
competed against RSA. On August 2, 2000, a second shareholder complaint was
filed against the Company and the aforementioned directors of RSA Security,
Inc. by plaintiff James V. Biglan. That case is captioned Biglan v. Stuckey, et
al. Civ. Action No. 18190NC (Del. Ch. 2000). On September 25, 2000 the Court
ordered the cases consolidated under the Moran caption and named lead counsel
for plaintiffs in this matter. Defendants are to respond to the Complaint no
later than December 11, 2000. While VeriSign cannot ascertain the outcome of
this matter presently, VeriSign believes that the claims against it are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.

   VeriSign is involved in various other investigations, claims and lawsuits
arising in the normal conduct of our business, none of which, in our opinion
will harm our business. VeriSign cannot assure that it will prevail in any
litigation. Regardless of the outcome, any litigation may require VeriSign to
incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of
management attention. An unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect
on VeriSign's financial position or results of operations.

Note 5. Calculation of Net Income (Loss) per Share

   Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income
(loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common stock
and, when dilutive, common equivalent shares from options to purchase common
stock using the treasury stock method. In the periods where the Company has a
net loss, net loss per share on a diluted basis is equivalent to basic net loss
per share because the effect of converting outstanding stock options would be
anti-dilutive. In addition, options to purchase shares of common stock were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods where the
options exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common
shares and therefore, the effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three-month
period ended September 30, 2000, options to purchase 28,136,475 shares of
common stock were outstanding, and for the three-month period ended September
30, 1999, options to purchase 18,608,450 shares of common stock were
outstanding.

Note 6. Segment Information

   VeriSign operates in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia-
Pacific and Japan and derives substantially all of its revenues from sales of
Internet infrastructure and web presence services. For the three months ended
September 30, 2000, the Company derived 10% of its revenue from international
subsidiaries and affiliates and for the three months ended September 30, 1999,
the Company derived 29% of its revenue from international subsidiaries and
affiliates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, the Company derived
16% of its revenue from international subsidiaries and affiliates and for the
nine months ended September 30, 1999, the Company derived 26% of its revenue
from international subsidiaries and affiliates. The decline in the percentage
of revenue from international subsidiaries and affiliates during the quarter
and nine months ended September 30, 2000 as compared to the quarter and nine
months ended September 30, 1999 is primarily due to the inclusion of the
Network Solutions' revenue.

   VeriSign has completed the integration of the THAWTE and Signio
acquisitions. The activities of both companies have been blended into the
legacy activities of VeriSign. As a result of the acquisition of Network
Solutions, the Company is reorganizing its lines of business and internal
reporting to improve the data reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.
The Company is establishing two segments that will be customer focused and
based on sales activity to customers. The Mass Markets Division will focus on
delivering all of our products and services to small and medium size
enterprises as well as to consumers looking to build a presence on the web. The
Enterprise and Service Provider Division will focus on large enterprises and
service providers around the globe who are looking to establish and deliver
secure Internet infrastructure services for their customers in both business to
consumer and business to business environments. The Company is currently
implementing this structure as part of its organizational strategy and such
implementation will occur over the next three to six months. The Company will
modify its segment reporting as necessary as its strategy is developed and
implemented.

Note 7. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 established methods of
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related
to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. We expect that the
adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have no material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. We will be required to implement
SFAS No. 133 for the year ending December 31, 2001.

Overview

   VeriSign is the leading provider of trusted infrastructure services to
website owners, enterprises, electronic commerce service providers and
individuals. The Company's domain name, digital certificate and payment
services provide the critical web identity, authentication and transaction
infrastructure that online businesses need to conduct secure e-commerce and
communications.

   VeriSign's core authentication service offerings were established as the
cornerstone of the business in 1995 with the introduction of website digital
certificates. Through our secure online infrastructure we sell our website
digital certificates to online businesses, large enterprises, government
agencies and other organizations. We have established strategic relationships
with industry leaders, including AOL/Netscape, British Telecommunications plc,
Cisco, Microsoft, RSA Security and VISA, to enable widespread utilization of
our digital certificate services and to assure interoperability with a wide
variety of applications and network equipment. We also offer VeriSign OnSite, a
managed service that allows an organization to leverage our trusted data
processing infrastructure to develop and deploy customized digital certificate
services for use by employees, customers and business partners.

   We market our authentication services worldwide through multiple
distribution channels, including the Internet, direct sales, telesales, value
added resellers, systems integrators and our international affiliates. A
significant portion of our authentication services revenues to date have been
generated through sales from our website, but we intend to continue increasing
our direct sales force, both in the United States and abroad, and to continue
to expand our other distribution channels. We continue to build an
international network of affiliates who provide our trust services under
licensed co-branding relationships using our proprietary technology and
business practices. The VeriSign Trust Network now consists of affiliated
organizations including British Telecommunications plc in the United Kingdom,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) of Canada, Certplus of France, eSign
of Australia, HiTrust of Taiwan, Roccade of The Netherlands, and Telia in
Sweden. These international service providers utilize common technology,
operating practices and infrastructure to deliver interoperable trust services
for a specific geographic region or vertical market.

   We expanded our authentication service offerings on February 1, 2000, when
we completed our acquisition of THAWTE Consulting (Pty) Ltd., a privately held
South African company that provides digital certificates to website owners and
software developers. In connection with this acquisition, we issued
approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the
outstanding shares of THAWTE. The transaction has been accounted for as a
purchase and, accordingly, the results of THAWTE's operations are

                                       14
<PAGE>

included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition.
As a result of our acquisition of THAWTE, we recorded goodwill and other
intangible assets of approximately $.7 billion. These amounts will be amortized
over a two to three year period.

   On February 29, 2000, we completed our acquisition of Signio, Inc., a
privately held company that provides payment services that connect online
merchants, business-to-business exchanges, payment processors and financial
institutions on the Internet. During the second quarter of 2000 the product
offering was extended to include new business-to-business payment services,
including support for Automated Clearing House (ACH) and purchasing card
transactions. In connection with this acquisition, we issued approximately 5.6
million shares of our common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding
shares of Signio and we also assumed Signio's outstanding employee stock
options. The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly,
the results of Signio's operations are included in our consolidated financial
statements from the date of acquisition. As a result of our acquisition of
Signio, we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately
$.9 billion. These amounts will be amortized over a two to three year period.

   We market our payment services worldwide through multiple distribution
channels, including the Internet, direct sales, telesales, value added
resellers, and systems integrators. A significant portion of our payment
services revenues to date has been generated through sales from our website,
but we intend to continue increasing our direct sales force, both in the United
States and abroad, and to continue to expand our other distribution channels.

   On June 8, 2000, we completed our acquisition of Network Solutions, Inc., a
publicly traded company that provides Internet domain name registration and
global registry services. We issued approximately 72.9 million shares of our
common stock for all of the outstanding shares of Network Solutions and we also
assumed all of Network Solutions' outstanding stock options. The acquisition
has been accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the total purchase price
of approximately $19.6 billion has been allocated to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their
respective fair values on the acquisition date. Network Solutions' results of
operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements from its
date of acquisition. As a result of our acquisition of Network Solutions, we
recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately $19.2 billion.
These amounts will be amortized over a three to four year period. Therefore, we
will report losses as we incur charges relating to the amortization of acquired
intangible assets.

   Network Solutions is the exclusive registry and the leading registrar for
second level domain names within the .com, .net and .org generic top-level
domains (gTLD) under agreements with ICANN and the Department of Commerce
(DOC). Internet domain names are unique identities that enable businesses,
other organizations and individuals to communicate and conduct commerce on the
Internet. As a registry, Network Solutions maintains the master directory of
all second level domain names in the .com, .net and .org top-level domains.
Network Solutions owns and maintains the shared registration system that allows
all registrars, including our own, to enter new second level domain names into
the master directory and to submit modifications, transfers, re-registrations
and deletions for existing second level domain names.

   As a registrar, Network Solutions markets second level domain name
registration services and other value-added services that enable our customers
to establish their identities on the web. The Network Solutions Registrar ("the
Registrar") markets its services through a number of distribution channels,
including the Internet, premier partner and business account partner programs,
and strategic alliances. The Registrar has approximately 13.7 million
cumulative domain names in the .com, .net and .org top-level domain. Recently,
the Registrar signed a key marketing alliance with America Online (AOL) to
offer the Registrar's domain name registration and value-added services across
AOL brands on a global basis.

   In December 1992, Network Solutions entered into the Cooperative Agreement
with the National Science Foundation under which Network Solutions was to
provide Internet domain name registration services for five top level domains:
 .com, .net, .org, .edu and .gov. These registration services include the
initial two-year

                                       15
<PAGE>

domain name registration and annual re-registration, and throughout the
registration term, maintenance of and unlimited modifications to individual
domain name records and updates to the master file of domain names. In
September 1998, the DOC took over the administration of the Cooperative
Agreement from the National Science Foundation. In October 1998, the
Cooperative Agreement was amended to extend the flexibility period until
September 30, 2000 and to transition to a shared registration system.

   On November 10, 1999, Network Solutions, the DOC and ICANN entered into a
series of wide-ranging agreements relating to the domain name system. Under
these agreements Network Solutions recognized ICANN as the not-for-profit
corporation described in the Cooperative Agreement as amended; became an ICANN-
accredited registrar and agreed to operate the registry in accordance with the
provisions of the registry agreement and the consensus policies established by
ICANN in accordance with the terms of that agreement. Network Solutions will be
an accredited registrar through November 9, 2004 with a right to renew
indefinitely in accordance with the cooperative agreement. As the registry,
Network Solutions charges registrars $6 per registration per year unless
increased to cover increases in registry costs under circumstances described in
the cooperative agreement.

   The term of the registry agreement extends until November 9, 2003, except in
the event that Network Solutions effects the legal separation of the ownership
of its registry business from its registrar business by May 9, 2001 as
described in the cooperative agreement, then the term will be extended until
November 9, 2007.

Results of Operations

   We have experienced substantial net losses in the past. As of September 30,
2000, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.9 billion, due in part
to $1.8 billion of goodwill and other intangible asset amortization related to
acquisitions.

 Revenues

   Revenues from authentication services consist of fees for the issuance of
digital certificates, fees for digital certificate service provisioning, fees
for technology and business process licensing to affiliates and fees for
consulting, implementation, training, support and maintenance services. Each of
these sources of revenue has different revenue recognition methods. We defer
revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates and recognize these
revenues ratably over the life of the digital certificate, generally 12 months.
We defer revenues from the sale of our OnSite managed services and recognize
these revenues ratably over the term of the license, generally 12 months. We
recognize revenues from the sale of digital certificate technology and business
process licensing to affiliates upon delivery of the technology and signing of
an agreement, provided the fee is fixed and determinable, collectibility is
probable and the arrangement does not require significant production,
modification or customization of the software. We recognize revenues from
consulting and training services using the percentage-of-completion method for
fixed-fee development arrangements or as the services are provided for time-
and-materials arrangements. We recognize revenues ratably over the term of the
agreement for support and maintenance services.

   Revenues from payment services primarily consist of service revenues from
transaction processing services. We recognize service revenue ratably over the
periods in which the services are provided. Advance customer deposits received
are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the services are
provided.

   Domain name registration revenues consist primarily of registration fees
charged to customers and registrars for domain name registration services. We
defer revenues from the sale or renewal of domain name registration services
and recognize these revenues ratably over the registration term.

   We accounted for the June 8, 2000 Network Solutions acquisition as a
purchase and Network Solutions' revenues, which are derived primarily from web
presence services, have been included in our results of operations commencing
June 9, 2000. In addition, we also acquired THAWTE in January 2000 and Signio
in February 2000. Therefore, comparisons of revenues for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 may not be relevant, as the businesses
of the combined company were not equivalent.

                                       16

   A comparison of revenues for the three-month periods and the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 is presented below.

   Nine-month period:
     Revenues........................................... $277,411 $57,100  386%
</TABLE>

   Revenues increased significantly from the prior year primarily due to the
acquisition of THAWTE, Signio and Network Solutions, increased sales of our
authentication services, particularly our website digital certificates and
VeriSign OnSite services, the expansion of our international affiliate network,
and delivery of more training and consulting services. As of September 30, 2000
we have sold over 400,000 website digital certificates, and over 1,400 OnSite
service solutions to enterprises, and we now have over 30 affiliates in our
international network of affiliates.

   A small portion of our revenue mix is from payment transaction services
provided by Signio. By the end of the first nine months of 2000, the customer
base for these services grew to in excess of 10,600 online merchants using
Signio, now VeriSign Payment Services, to payment-enable their online stores
and business-to-business commerce activities.

   The current quarter results reflect a full quarter of activity from Network
Solutions which VeriSign acquired on June 8, 2000. For the three months ended
September 30, 2000, the Registrar added nearly 2.2 million new names and the
Registry, now VeriSign Global Registry, accounted for 5.1 million new domain
names and over 650,000 renewed or extended domain names. The Registry also
completed the transfer of over 400,000 domain names between accredited
registrars thereby supporting over 6.1 million domain name transactions in the
quarter.

   No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the three months
ended, or during the nine months ended September 30, 2000 or 1999. Revenues
from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for 10% of revenues in
the third quarter of 2000, and 29% of revenues in the third quarter of 1999.
For the first nine months of the year, revenues from international subsidiaries
and affiliates accounted for 16% of revenues in 2000, and 26% of revenues in
1999.

 Costs and Expenses

   We accounted for the Network Solutions acquisition as a purchase and Network
Solutions' costs and expenses have been included in our results of operations
commencing June 9, 2000. In addition, we also acquired THAWTE in January 2000
and Signio in February 2000. Therefore, comparisons of costs and expenses for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 may not be
relevant, as the businesses of the combined company were not equivalent.

 Cost of revenues

   Cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to providing digital
certificate enrollment and issuance services, payment services, domain name
registration services, customer support and training, consulting and
development services and costs of facilities and computer equipment used in
these activities. In addition, with respect to our digital certificate
services, cost of revenues also includes fees paid to third parties to verify
certificate applicants' identities, insurance premiums for our service warranty
plan and errors and omission insurance and the cost of software resold to
customers.

   Nine-month period:
     Cost of revenues................................. $94,971  $22,379   324%
     Percentage of revenues...........................      34%      39%
</TABLE>

   During the third quarter of 2000 and during the first nine months of 2000
cost of revenues increased due to an increase in headcount required to support
the growth in demand for our products and services and to support the growth of
our security consulting and training activities during the period. The cost of
insurance premiums for our service warranty plan increased because of greater
levels of sales of digital certificates. In addition, we incurred increased
expenses for access to third-party databases, higher support charges for our
external disaster recovery program and increased expenses related to the cost
of software products resold to customers as part of network security solution
implementations. Additionally, acquisitions, such as THAWTE, Signio and Network
Solutions, have resulted in an increase in our cost of revenues over prior
quarters. Future acquisitions, further expansion into international markets and
introductions of additional products will result in further increases in cost
of revenues, due to additional personnel and related expenses and other
factors.

   Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue decreased from 1999 to 2000
primarily due to the overall mix of revenues, the experience of economies of
scale on our technology infrastructure and the efficiency gains in the
certificate enrollment and issuance process. In addition, revenues derived from
our recent acquisitions of THAWTE, Signio and Network Solutions, have a
different cost structure from our authentication services. We anticipate that
cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars as a result of
continued growth in all of our lines of business.

 Sales and marketing

   Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales,
marketing, and external affair activities. These expenses include salaries,
sales commissions and other personnel-related expenses, travel and related
expenses, costs of computer and communications equipment and support services,
facilities costs, consulting fees and costs of marketing programs, such as
Internet, television, radio and print advertising.

   A comparison of sales and marketing expenses for the three-month periods and
the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 is presented below.

     Percentage of revenues..........................       36%      43%
</TABLE>

   The Network Solutions acquisition was the primary reason for the increase in
sales and marketing expenses in the three and nine month periods of 2000 as
compared to those periods in 1999. The Registrar

                                       18
<PAGE>

continues to incur expenses promoting the value of the .com, .net and .org web
addresses as well as value-added services including web site design tools and
other enhanced service offerings. The remainder of the increase was driven by
lead and demand generation activities in our authentication businesses,
expansion of our sales force, an increase in international sales expenses, and
the effect of a full quarter of sales and marketing expenses from THAWTE and
Signio. While the absolute dollar spending increased for sales and marketing
expenses, we continue to realize a decline in spending from 1999 to 2000 as a
percentage of revenue. This is primarily due to the increase in recurring
revenue from existing customers, which tend to have lower acquisition costs
associated with them, and the increase in the productivity of the direct and
inside sales forces. However, we cannot forecast that these sales and marketing
expenses will continue to decline as a percentage of revenues.

   We do expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase on an
absolute dollar basis in the future, primarily related to an expanded sales
force, expanded marketing and demand generation activities, development and
enhancement of partner and distribution channels and promotional activities for
web presence products and services.

 Research and development

   Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to
research and development personnel, including salaries and other personnel-
related expenses, consulting fees and the costs of facilities, computer and
communications equipment and support services used in service and technology
development.

   A comparison of research and development expenses for the three-month
periods and the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 is
presented below.

   Nine-month period:
    Research and development............................ $26,028  $9,478   175%
    Percentage of revenues..............................       9%     17%
</TABLE>

   Research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in the third
quarter of 2000 from the third quarter of 1999 primarily due to the acquisition
of Network Solutions and from continued investment in the design, testing and
deployment of, and technical support for our expanded Internet trust service
offerings and technology. The increase reflects the expansion of our
engineering staff and related costs required to support our continued emphasis
on developing new products and services as well as enhancing existing products
and services. The decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage
of revenues from 1999 to 2000 is primarily due to different cost structures
related to new acquisitions.

   We believe that timely development of new and enhanced authentication
services, transaction services, web presence services and technology are
necessary to maintain our position in the marketplace. Accordingly, we intend
to continue to recruit experienced research and development personnel and to
make other investments in research and development. As a result, we expect
research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute
dollars. To date, we have expensed all research and development expenditures as
incurred.

 General and administrative

   General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other
personnel-related expenses for our executive, administrative, legal, finance
and human resources personnel, facilities and computer and communications
equipment, support services and professional services fees.

    General and administrative......................... $35,705  $6,122    483%
    Percentage of revenues.............................      13%     11%
</TABLE>

   The increase in general and administrative expenses for the third quarter,
as well as for the first nine months of 2000, over the third quarter and first
nine months of 1999 was related to the acquisition of Network Solutions in June
2000 and the acquisition of THAWTE and Signio in the first quarter of 2000.
Expenses also increased due to additional staffing levels required to manage
and support our expanded operations, the implementation of additional
management information systems, and the expansion of our corporate
headquarters.

   We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to
increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future as we expand our
administrative and executive staff, add infrastructure, expand facilities and
assimilate acquired technologies and businesses.

 Write-off of acquired in-process research and development

   The portion of the Network Solutions purchase price allocated to in-process
research and development ("IPR&D") was $54 million and was expensed during the
quarter ended June 30, 2000. Network Solutions' IPR&D efforts focused on
significant and substantial improvements and upgrades to its shared
registration system ("SRS"). The SRS is the system that provides shared
registration interface to the accredited and licensed registrars into the .com,
 .net, and .org generic top level domain ("gTLD") name registry. It is through
this system that registrars from all over the world are able to register domain
names with the central database. Given the high demand on the SRS, it is in
need of improvements and upgrades in the area of scalability, security, non-
english language capability and next generation resource provisioning protocol.

   As of the acquisition date, Network Solutions was in the process of
developing technology that would add substantial functionality and features to
the SRS. The IPR&D had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no
alternative uses. The IPR&D under development may not achieve technical or
commercial viability. The technological feasibility of the in-process
development efforts is established when the enterprise has completed all
planning, designing, coding, and testing activities that are necessary to
establish that the technology can be utilized to meet its design specifications
including functions, features, and technical performance requirements. This
estimate was based on the project costs and milestones. As of September 30,
2000, efforts related to upgrades and improvements in the SRS are continuing,
in particular related to non-english language capabilities and security. These
efforts are expected to be significantly completed by the end of 2000.

   The fair value assigned to IPR&D was estimated by discounting, to present
value, the cash flows attributable to the technology once it has reached
technological feasibility. A discount rate consistent with the risks of the
project was used to estimate the present value of cash flows. The value
assigned to IPR&D was the amount attributable to the efforts of Network
Solutions up to the time of acquisition. This amount was estimated through
application of the "stage of completion" calculation by multiplying the
estimated present value of future cash flows, excluding costs of completion, by
the percentage of completion of the purchased research and development project
at the time of acquisition.

 Amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets

   Goodwill and other intangible assets resulted primarily from our
acquisitions of THAWTE in January 2000, Signio in February 2000 and Network
Solutions in June 2000. We expect to recognize goodwill and other intangible
asset amortization charges related to these acquisitions of up to $1.4 billion
per quarter until the goodwill and other intangible asset balances from these
acquisitions become fully amortized ending in 2004. In addition, in the event
we complete future acquisitions, we expect to incur additional goodwill and
other intangible asset amortization charges.

 Other Income

   Other income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash
equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, gains on sale of equity
investments and as well as the net effect of foreign currency transaction gains
and losses. Other income also includes charges for any gains or losses on the
disposal of property and equipment and other miscellaneous expenses.

   A comparison of other income for the three-month periods and the nine-month
periods ended September 30, 2000 and 1999 is presented below.

    Other income...................................... $63,342  $4,793  1,222%
    Percentage of revenues............................      23%      8%
</TABLE>

   The increase in other income in the third quarter of 2000 compared to the
third quarter of 1999 is primarily due to increased earnings on funds invested.
Investments have increased in part due to our net proceeds of $121.4 million
generated from the follow-on public offering of our common stock during January
1999 and investment of cash generated from operations. The investment base was
also significantly increased through the acquisition of Network Solutions,
which added over $875 million of cash and investments. For the first nine
months of 2000 the increase over the first nine months of 1999 was also due to
a $32.6 million gain from the sale of shares of Keynote Systems, Inc. We may
from time to time derive gains from the sale of our equity investments as
considered necessary.

 Provision for Income Taxes

   No provision has been made for income taxes due to cumulative book losses.
As discussed above under Note 2-- Business Combinations -- Purchase Price
Allocations, we recorded deferred tax liabilities for Network Solutions and
Signio for identifiable intangibles assets that are not deductible for federal
and state income tax purposes. As a result of recording the deferred tax
liabilities and considering their effect on the combined entity, a
corresponding amount of deferred tax asset valuation allowance was reduced and
offset against goodwill. Amortization of goodwill for these acquisitions is not
deductible for tax purposes.

   The Company has elected to treat the acquisition of THAWTE's South African
operation as an asset acquisition together with a federal election to include
the South African operation in the federal tax return of VeriSign. These
elections will allow the goodwill and other intangibles of THAWTE in South
Africa to be amortized over 15 years in the United States federal tax return of
VeriSign.

Factors That May Affect Future Results of Operations

 We have a limited operating history under our current business structure.

   We were incorporated in April 1995, and we began introducing our trusted
infrastructure services in June 1995. In addition, we have completed four
acquisitions in 2000, including the acquisition of Network Solutions.
Therefore, we have only a limited operating history on which to base an
evaluation of our consolidated business and prospects. Our prospects must be
considered in light of the risks and uncertainties encountered by companies in
the early stages of development. These risks and uncertainties are often worse
for companies in new and rapidly evolving markets and for companies integrating
many businesses. Our success will depend on many factors, including, but not
limited to, the following:

  . the successful integration of THAWTE, Signio, and Network Solutions;

  . the rate and timing of the growth and use of internet protocol (IP)
    networks for electronic commerce and communications;

  . the extent to which digital certificates and domain names are used for
    these communications and/or e-commerce;

  . the continued growth in the number of web sites;

  . the growth in demand for our payment services;

  . the continued evolution of electronic commerce as a viable means of
    conducting business;

  . the demand for our Internet infrastructure services and web presence
    services;

  . the competition for any of our services;

  . the perceived security of electronic commerce and communications over IP
    networks;

  . the perceived security of our services, technology, infrastructure and
    practices; and

  . our continued ability to maintain our current, and enter into additional,
    strategic relationships

   To address these risks we must, among other things:

  . successfully market our Internet infrastructure services, our digital
    certificates and our web presence services to new and existing customers;

  . attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate qualified personnel;

  . respond to competitive developments;

  . successfully introduce new Internet infrastructure services and web
    presence services; and

  . successfully introduce enhancements to our existing Internet
    infrastructure services and web presence services to address new
    technologies and standards and changing market conditions.

   We cannot be certain that we will successfully address these risks.

   Our business depends on the future growth of the Internet and adoption and
continued use of IP networks.

   Our future success substantially depends on the continued growth in the use
of the Internet and IP networks. If the use of and interest in the Internet and
IP networks does not continue to grow, our business would be harmed. To date,
many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing the Internet
and IP networks for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:

  . potentially inadequate development of network infrastructure;

  . security concerns, particularly for online payments, including the
    potential for merchant or user impersonation and fraud or theft of stored
    data and information communicated over IP networks;

                                       22
<PAGE>

  . other security concerns such as attacks on popular websites by "hackers;"

  . inconsistent quality of service;

  . lack of availability of cost-effective, high-speed systems and service;

  . limited number of local access points for corporate users;

  . inability to integrate business applications on IP networks;

  . the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products;

  . government regulation; and

  . a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of IP networks.

   The widespread acceptance of the Internet and IP networks will require a
broad acceptance of new methods of conducting business and exchanging
information. Organizations that already have invested substantial resources in
other methods of conducting business may be reluctant to adopt new methods.
Also, individuals with established patterns of purchasing goods and services
and effecting payments may be reluctant to change.

   Our near-term success depends, in part, on the growth of the web presence
services business

   VeriSign may not be able to sustain the revenue growth it has experienced in
recent periods. In addition, past revenue growth may not be indicative of
future operating results. If VeriSign does not successfully maintain its
current position as a leading provider of domain name registration services or
develop or market additional value-added products and services, our business
could be harmed.

   Web presence services will account for a very significant portion of our
revenue in at least the near term. Its future success will depend largely on:

  . continued new domain name registrations;

  . re-registration rates of our customers;

  . our ability to maintain our current position as a leading registrar of
    domain names;

  . the successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new
    services that address the demands of Internet users;

  . our ability to provide robust domain name registration systems; and

  . our ability to provide a superior customer service infrastructure as a
    registry and registrar.

   Issues arising from implementation agreements with ICANN and the Department
of Commerce could harm its registration business

   The Department of Commerce has adopted a plan for a phased transition of the
Department of Commerce's responsibilities for the domain name system to ICANN.
VeriSign faces risks from this transition, including:

  . ICANN could adopt or promote policies, procedures or programs that are
    unfavorable to our role in the registration of domain names or that are
    inconsistent with our current or future plans;

  . The Department of Commerce or ICANN could terminate our agreements to be
    the registry and/or a registrar in the .com, .net and .org top level
    domains if they find that it is in violation of our agreements with them;

  . If we do not separate ownership of our registry and registrar by May 2001
    in accordance with the registry agreement, the term of the registry
    agreement will expire in November 2003 and we may not be chosen as the
    successor registry;

                                       23
<PAGE>

  . The terms of the registrar accreditation contract could change, as a
    result of an ICANN-adopted policy, in a manner that is unfavorable to us;

  . The Department of Commerce's or ICANN's interpretation of provisions of
    our agreements with either of them described above could differ from
    ours;

  . The Department of Commerce could revoke its recognition of ICANN, as a
    result of which the Department of Commerce would take the place of ICANN
    for purposes of the various agreements described above, and could take
    actions that are harmful to us;

  . ICANN may approve new top level domains and we may not be selected to act
    as a registrar or registry with respect to those top level domains;

  . The U.S. Government could refuse to transfer certain responsibilities for
    domain name system administration to ICANN due to security, stability or
    other reasons, resulting in fragmentation or other instability in domain
    name system administration; and

  . Our registry business could face legal or other challenges resulting from
    the activities of other registrars.

   Challenges to ongoing privatization of Internet administration could harm
VeriSign's web presence services business

   Risks VeriSign faces from challenges by third parties, including other
domestic and foreign governmental authorities, to our role in the ongoing
privatization of the Internet include:

  . Legal, regulatory or other challenges, including challenges to the
    agreements governing our relationship with, or to the legal authority
    underlying the roles and actions of, the Department of Commerce, ICANN
    and/or us, could be brought;

  . Congress has held two hearings in which various issues about the domain
    name system have been raised and Congress could take action that is
    unfavorable to us;

  . Congress has issued a Conference Report directing the General Accounting
    Office to review the relationship between the Department of Commerce and
    ICANN and the adequacy of security arrangements under existing Department
    of Commerce cooperative agreements. An adverse report could cause
    Congress to take action that is unfavorable to us or the stability of the
    domain name system;

  . ICANN could fail to maintain its role, potentially resulting in
    instability in domain name system administration; and

  . Some foreign governments and governmental authorities have in the past
    disagreed with, and may in the future disagree with, the actions,
    policies or programs of ICANN, the U.S. Government and us relating to the
    domain name system. These foreign governments or governmental authorities
    may take actions or adopt policies or programs that are harmful to our
    business.

   Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and our future revenues and
profitability are uncertain.

   Our quarterly operating results have varied and may fluctuate significantly
in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside
our control. These factors include the following:

  . continued market acceptance of our trusted infrastructure services;

  . the long sales and implementation cycles for, and potentially large order
    sizes of, some of our Internet trust services and the timing and
    execution of individual contracts;

  . volume of domain name registrations through our web presence services
    business and VeriSign's Global Registry Service business;

  . customer renewal rates for our Internet infrastructure services and web
    presence services;

                                      24
<PAGE>

  . competition in the web presence services business from competing
    registrars and registries;

  . the additional introduction of alternative Internet naming systems:

  . the timing of releases of new versions of Internet browsers or other
    third-party software products and networking equipment that include our
    digital certificate service interface technology;

  . the mix of all our offered services sold during a quarter;

  . our success in marketing other internet infrastructure services and web
    presence value added services to our existing customers and to new
    customers;

  . continued development of our direct and indirect distribution channels,
    both in the U.S. and abroad;

  . market acceptance of our Internet infrastructure services and new service
    offerings or our competitors' products and services;

  . our ability to expand operations;

  . our success in assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired
    businesses;

  . the amount and timing of expenditures related to expansion of our
    operations;

  . the impact of price changes in our Internet infrastructure services and
    web presence services or our competitors' products and services; and

  . general economic conditions and economic conditions specific to IP
    network and Internet industries.

   In addition, we expect a significant increase in our operating expenses as
we:

  . amortize goodwill and other intangible assets from our prior
    acquisitions;

  . increase our sales and marketing operations and activities, and

  . continue to update our systems and infrastructure.

   If the increase in our expenses is not accompanied by a corresponding
increase in our revenue, our operating results will suffer, particularly as
revenues from many of our services are recognized ratably over the term of the
service, rather than immediately when the customer pays for them, unlike our
sales and marketing expenditures which are expensed in full when incurred.

   Due to all of the above factors, our quarterly revenues and operating
results are difficult to forecast. Therefore, we believe that period-to-period
comparisons of our operating results will not necessarily be meaningful, and
you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Also,
operating results may fall below our expectations and the expectations of
securities analysts or investors in one or more future quarters. If this were
to occur, the market price of our common stock would likely decline.

   We face significant competition.

   We anticipate that the market for services that enable trusted and secure
electronic commerce and communications over IP networks will remain intensely
competitive. We compete with larger and smaller companies that provide products
and services that are similar to some aspects of our Internet infrastructure
services. We expect that competition will increase in the near term, and that
our primary long-term competitors may not yet have entered the market.
Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced margins or the
failure of our Internet trust services to achieve or maintain market
acceptance, any of which could harm our business. Several of our current and
potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater
financial, technical, marketing and other resources. As a result, we may not be
able to compete effectively.

   The introduction of additional competition into the web presence services
business could harm our business. This includes, in particular, competition
among registrars within a single top-level domain, such as .com, and
competition among registrars and registries of existing and potential new top-
level domains. We

                                       25
<PAGE>

currently face competition in the web presence services business from other
registrars in the top level domains in which we act as the registry, third
level domain name providers such as Internet access providers and registrars
and registries of top level domains other than those top level domains for
which we act as the registry. As of September 30, 2000, 66 accredited
registrars (in addition to us) in the .com, .net and .org top level domains
used VeriSign's Global Registry Services shared registration system to register
domain names. ICANN has accredited approximately 70 additional registrars as of
that date. VeriSign expects these and additional accredited registrars to offer
competing web presence services in these top-level domains in the future.

   The introduction of potential new top-level domains is currently under
review. At its November 2000 meeting in Los Angeles, the ICANN Board of
Directors is expected to select the finalists from prospective parties that
submitted proposals seeking to sponsor or operate one or more new top-level
domains and December 31, 2000 is the target date for completion of negotiations
with the new top-level domain registry sponsors or operators.

   Future competition in the web presence services business as a registry or
registrar could come from many new sources, including:

  . domain name registration resellers;

  . country code registries;

  . Internet access providers; and

  . major telecommunications firms.

   Many of these entities have core capabilities to deliver registry and/or
registrar services, such as help desks, billing services and network
management, along with strong name recognition and Internet industry
experience. The recent agreements among ICANN, the Department of Commerce, the
Company and other registrars permit flexibility in pricing for and term of
registrations. VeriSign's revenue, therefore, could be reduced due to pricing
pressures, bundled service offerings and variable terms resulting from
increased competition. Some registrars and resellers in the .com, .net and .org
top-level domains are already charging lower prices for web presence services
in those domains. In addition, other entities are bundling, and may in the
future bundle, domain name registrations with other products or services at
reduced rates or for free.

   Our Internet infrastructure services market is new and evolving.

   We target our Internet infrastructure services at the market for trusted and
secure electronic commerce and communications over IP networks. This is a new
and rapidly evolving market that may not continue to grow. Accordingly, the
demand for our Internet infrastructure services is very uncertain. Even if the
market for electronic commerce and communications over IP networks grows, our
Internet infrastructure services may not be widely accepted. The factors that
may affect the level of market acceptance of digital certificates and,
consequently, our Internet infrastructure services include the following:

  . market acceptance of products and services based upon authentication
    technologies other than those we use;

  . public perception of the security of digital certificates and IP
    networks;

  . the ability of the Internet infrastructure to accommodate increased
    levels of usage; and

  . government regulations affecting electronic commerce and communications
    over IP networks.

   Even if digital certificates achieve market acceptance, our Internet
infrastructure services may fail to address the market's requirements
adequately. If digital certificates do not sustain or increase their
acceptance, or if our Internet infrastructure services in particular do not
achieve or sustain market acceptance, our business would be materially harmed.

                                       26
<PAGE>

   System interruptions and security breaches could harm our business.

   We depend on the uninterrupted operation of our various registration
systems, secure data centers and our other computer and communications systems.
We must protect these systems from loss, damage or interruption caused by fire,
earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure or other events beyond our
control. Most of our systems are located at, and most of our customer
information is stored in, our facilities in Mountain View, California and
Kawasaki, Japan, both of which are susceptible to earthquakes, and Herndon,
Virginia. All of our web presence services systems, including those used in our
domain name registry and registrar business are located at our Herndon,
Virginia facilities. Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in any of
these facilities or our other computer and communications systems could
materially harm our business. In addition, our ability to issue digital
certificates and register domain names depends on the efficient operation of
the Internet connections from customers to our secure data centers and our
various registration systems as well as from customers to our registrar and
from our registrar and other registrars to the shared registration system.
These connections depend upon efficient operation of web browsers, Internet
service providers and Internet backbone service providers, all of which have
had periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past. Any of
these problems or outages could decrease customer satisfaction.

   A failure in the operation of our various registration systems or other
events could result in deletion of one or more domain names from the Internet
for a period of time. A failure in the operation of our shared registration
system could result in the inability of one or more other registrars to
register and maintain domain names for a period of time. A failure in the
operation or update of the master database that we maintain could result in
deletion of one or more top-level domains from the Internet and the
discontinuation of second level domain names in those top level domains for a
period of time. The inability of our registrar systems, including our back
office billing and collections infrastructure, and telecommunications systems
to meet the demands of the increasing number of domain name registration
requests and corresponding customer e-mails and telephone calls, including
speculative, otherwise abusive and repetitive e-mail domain name registration
and modification requests, could result in substantial degradation in our
customer support service and our ability to process, bill and collect
registration requests in a timely manner.

   We retain certain confidential customer information in our secure data
centers and various registration systems. It is critical to our business
strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived
by the marketplace to be secure. Our domain name registration operations also
depends on our ability to maintain our computer and telecommunications
equipment in effective working order and to reasonably protect our systems
against interruption and potentially on such maintenance and protection by
other registrars in the shared registration system. The root zone servers and
top-level domain name zone servers that VeriSign operates are critical hardware
to our web presence operations. Therefore, we may have to expend significant
time and money to maintain or increase the security of our facilities and
infrastructure.

   Despite our security measures, our infrastructure may be vulnerable to
physical break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers or similar
disruptive problems. It is possible that we may have to expend additional
financial and other resources to address such problems. Any physical or
electronic break-ins or other security breaches or compromises of the
information stored at our secure data centers and domain name registration
systems may jeopardize the security of information stored on our premises or in
the computer systems and networks of our customers. In such an event, we could
face significant liability and customers could be reluctant to use our Internet
infrastructure services and web presence services. Such an occurrence could
also result in adverse publicity and therefore adversely affect the market's
perception of the security of electronic commerce and communications over IP
networks as well as of the security or reliability of our services.

   Acquisitions could harm our business.

   We acquired THAWTE and Signio in February 2000 and Network Solutions in June
2000. We could experience difficulty in integrating the personnel, products,
technologies or operations of these companies. In addition, assimilating
acquired businesses involves a number of other risks, including, but not
limited to:

  . the potential disruption of our business;

  . the potential impairment of relationships with our employees, customers
    and strategic partners;

  . the additional expenses associated with the amortization of goodwill and
    other intangible assets, which we expect will be an aggregate of
    approximately $20 billion for the three acquisitions and will be
    amortized straight-line generally from two to four years;

  . unanticipated costs or the incurrence of unknown liabilities;

  . the need to manage more geographically-dispersed operations, such as
    Network Solutions' offices in Virginia and THAWTE's offices in North
    Carolina and South Africa;

  . diversion of management's resources from other business concerns;

  . the inability to retain the employees of the acquired businesses;

  . adverse effects on existing customer relationships of THAWTE, Signio or
    Network Solutions;

  . the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the
    acquired businesses;

  . our inability to incorporate acquired technologies successfully into our
    Internet infrastructure services; and

  . the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and
    policies.

   If we are unable to successfully address any of these risks for future
acquisitions, our business could be harmed.

   Our equity investments in other companies may not yield any returns

   We have equity investments in a number of companies. In most instances these
investments are in the form of equity securities of private companies for which
there is no public market. These companies are typically in the early stage of
development and may be expected to incur substantial losses. Therefore, these
companies may never become publicly traded companies. Even if they do, an
active trading market for their securities may never develop and we may never
realize any return on these investments. Although, we have realized gains on
the sale of equity investments in the past, we can not expect to experience
similar levels of other income in the future. Further, if these companies are
not successful, we could incur charges related to write-downs or write-offs of
these types of assets. Losses or charges resulting from these investments could
harm our operating results.

   Technological changes will affect our business.

   The emerging nature of the Internet, digital certificate business and the
domain name registration business, and their rapid evolution, requires us to
continually improve the performance, features and reliability of our Internet
infrastructure services and web presence services, particularly in response to
competitive offerings. We must also introduce any new Internet infrastructure
services and web presence services, as quickly as possible. The success of new
Internet infrastructure services and web presence services depends on several
factors, including proper new service definition and timely completion,
introduction and market acceptance of our new Internet infrastructure services
or web presence services. We may not succeed in developing and marketing new
Internet infrastructure services and web presence services that respond to
competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs. This
could harm our business.

                                       28
<PAGE>

   We must manage our growth and expansion.

   Our historical growth has placed, and any further growth is likely to
continue to place, a significant strain on our resources. We have grown from 26
employees at December 31, 1995 to over 1,800 employees at September 30, 2000.
In addition to internal growth, our employee base grew through acquisitions. We
have also opened additional sales offices and have significantly expanded our
operations, both in the U.S. and abroad, during this time period. To be
successful, we will need to implement additional management information
systems, develop further our operating, administrative, financial and
accounting systems and controls and maintain close coordination among our
executive, engineering, accounting, finance, marketing, sales and operations
organizations. Any failure to manage growth effectively could harm our
business.

   We depend on key personnel.

   We depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key
employees. Our success will also depend on our ability to attract, integrate,
train, retain and motivate these individuals and additional highly skilled
technical and sales and marketing personnel, both in the U.S. and abroad. There
is intense competition for these personnel. In addition, our stringent hiring
practices for some of our key personnel, which consist of background checks
into prospective employees' criminal and financial histories, further limit the
number of qualified persons for these positions. We have no employment
agreements with any of our key executives that prevent them from leaving us at
any time. In addition, we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of
our officers or key employees other than our President and Chief Executive
Officer. The loss of the services of any of our senior management team or other
key employees or failure to attract, integrate, train, retain and motivate
additional key employees could harm our business.

   VeriSign relies on third parties who maintain and control root zone servers
and route Internet communications.

   VeriSign currently administers and operates only two of the 13 root zone
servers. The others are administered and operated by independent operators on a
volunteer basis. Because of the importance to the functioning of the Internet
of these root zone servers, VeriSign's web presence services could be harmed if
these volunteer operators fail to properly maintain such servers or abandon
such servers.

   Further, VeriSign's web presence services could be harmed if any of these
volunteer operators fail to include or provide accessibility to the data that
it maintains in the root zone servers that it controls.

   In the event and to the extent that ICANN is authorized to set policy with
regard to an authoritative root server system, as provided in the registry
agreement, it is required to ensure that the authoritative root will point to
the top level domain zone servers designated by it. If ICANN does not do this,
VeriSign's business could be harmed.

   VeriSign's web presence services also could be harmed if a significant
number of Internet service providers decided not to route Internet
communications to or from domain names registered by it or if a significant
number of Internet service providers decided to provide routing to a set of
domain name servers that did not point to its top level domain zone servers.

   We must establish and maintain strategic and other relationships.

   One of our significant business strategies has been to enter into strategic
or other similar collaborative relationships in order to reach a larger
customer base than we could reach through our direct sales and marketing
efforts. Examples of these types of relationships include AOL/Netscape, Cisco,
Microsoft and RSA Security. We may need to enter into additional relationships
to execute our business plan. We may not be able to enter into additional, or
maintain our existing, strategic relationships on commercially reasonable
terms. If

                                       29
<PAGE>

we fail to enter into additional relationships, we would have to devote
substantially more resources to the distribution, sale and marketing of our
Internet infrastructure services and web presence services than we would
otherwise. As a result of our emphasis on these relationships, our success in
these relationships will depend both on the ultimate success of the other
parties to these relationships, particularly in the use and promotion of IP
networks for trusted and secure electronic commerce and communications, and on
the ability of these parties to market our Internet infrastructure services
successfully. Furthermore, our ability to achieve future growth will also
depend on our ability to continue to establish direct seller channels and to
develop multiple distribution channels, particularly with respect to our web
presence services business. To do this we must maintain relationships with
Internet access providers and other third parties. Failure of one or more of
our strategic relationships to result in the development and maintenance of a
market for our Internet infrastructure services or web presence services could
harm our business.

   Many of our existing relationships do not, and any future relationships may
not, afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights. In addition, the
other parties may not view their relationships with us as significant for their
own businesses. Therefore, they could reduce their commitment to us at any time
in the future. These parties could also pursue alternative technologies or
develop alternative products and services either on their own or in
collaboration with others, including our competitors. If we are unable to
maintain our relationships or to enter into additional relationships, this
could harm our business.

   Some of our Internet infrastructure services have lengthy sales and
implementation cycles.

   We market many of our Internet infrastructure services directly to large
companies and government agencies. The sale and implementation of our services
to these entities typically involves a lengthy education process and a
significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources.
This process is also subject to the risk of delays associated with customers'
internal budgeting and other procedures for approving large capital
expenditures, deploying new technologies within their networks and testing and
accepting new technologies that affect key operations. As a result, the sales
and implementation cycles associated with certain of our Internet
infrastructure services can be lengthy, potentially lasting from three to six
months. Our quarterly and annual operating results could be materially harmed
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not
realized.

   Our services could have unknown defects.

   Services as complex as those we offer or develop frequently contain
undetected defects or errors. Despite testing, defects or errors may occur in
our existing or new services, which could result in loss of or delay in
revenues, loss of market share, failure to achieve market acceptance, diversion
of development resources, injury to our reputation, tort or warranty claims,
increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs, any of which
could harm our business. Furthermore, we often provide implementation,
customization, consulting and other technical services in connection with the
implementation and ongoing maintenance of our services, which typically
involves working with sophisticated software, computing and communications
systems. Our failure or inability to meet customer expectations in a timely
manner could also result in loss of or delay in revenues, loss of market share,
failure to achieve market acceptance, injury to our reputation and increased
costs.

   Public key cryptography technology is subject to risks.

   Our Internet infrastructure services depend on public key cryptography
technology. With public key cryptography technology, a user is given a public
key and a private key, both of which are required to encrypt and decode
messages. The security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of
a user's private key and that it is not stolen or otherwise compromised. The
integrity of private keys also depends in part on the application of specific
mathematical principles known as "factoring." This integrity is predicated on
the assumption that the factoring of large numbers into their prime number
components is difficult. Should an easy factoring method be developed, the
security of encryption products utilizing public key cryptography technology
would be reduced or eliminated. Furthermore, any significant advance in
techniques for attacking

                                       30
<PAGE>

cryptographic systems could also render some or all of our existing Internet
infrastructure services obsolete or unmarketable. If improved techniques for
attacking cryptographic systems were ever developed, we would likely have to
reissue digital certificates to some or all of our customers, which could
damage our reputation and brand or otherwise harm our business. In the past
there have been public announcements of the successful decoding of some types
of cryptographic messages and of the potential misappropriation of private
keys. This type of publicity could also hurt the public perception as to the
safety of the public key cryptography technology included in our digital
certificates. This negative public perception could harm our business.

   Our international operations are subject to certain risks.

   Revenues from international subsidiaries and affiliates accounted for
approximately 27% of our revenues in the full year of 1999 and 10% of our
revenues in the third quarter of 2000. We intend to expand our international
operations and international sales and marketing activities. For example, with
our acquisition of THAWTE we have additional operations in South Africa and
with our acquisition of Network Solutions we have additional operations in Asia
and Europe. Expansion into these markets has required and will continue to
require significant management attention and resources. We may also need to
tailor our Internet infrastructure trust services and web presence services for
a particular market and to enter into international distribution and operating
relationships. We have limited experience in localizing our services and in
developing international distribution or operating relationships. We may not
succeed in expanding our services into international
markets. Failure to do so could harm our business. In addition, there are risks
inherent in doing business on an international basis, including, among others:

  . competition with foreign companies;

  . regulatory requirements;

  . legal uncertainty regarding liability and compliance with foreign laws;

  . export and import restrictions on cryptographic technology and products
    incorporating that technology;

  . tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions;

  . difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;

  . longer sales and payment cycles;

  . problems in collecting accounts receivable;

  . currency fluctuations;

  . difficulty of authenticating customer information;

  . political instability;

  . failure of foreign laws to adequately protect our U.S. proprietary
    rights;

  . seasonal reductions in business activity; and

  . potentially adverse tax consequences.

   We have licensed to international affiliates the VeriSign Processing Center
platform, which is designed to replicate our own secure data centers and allows
the affiliate to offer back-end processing of Internet infrastructure services.
The VeriSign Processing Center platform provides an affiliate with the
knowledge and technology to offer Internet infrastructure services similar to
those offered by us. It is critical to our business strategy that the
facilities and infrastructure used in issuing and marketing digital
certificates remain secure and we are perceived by the marketplace to be
secure. Although we provide the affiliate with training in security and trust
practices, network management and customer service and support, these practices
are performed by the affiliate and are outside of our control. Any failure of
an affiliate to maintain the privacy of confidential customer information could
result in negative publicity and therefore adversely affect the market's
perception of the security of our services as well as

                                       31
<PAGE>

the security of electronic commerce and communication over IP networks
generally. For further information, please see "--System interruptions and
security breaches could harm our business."

   All of our international revenues from sources other than VeriSign Japan are
denominated in U.S. dollars. If additional portions of our international
revenues were to be denominated in foreign currencies, we could become subject
to increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

   Our Internet infrastructure services could be affected by government
regulation.

   Exports of software products utilizing encryption technology are generally
restricted by the United States and various non-United States governments.
Although we have obtained approval to export our Global Server digital
certificate service, and none of our other Internet infrastructure services are
currently subject to export controls under United States law, the list of
products and countries for which export approval is required could be revised
in the future to include more digital certificate products and related
services. If we do not obtain required approvals we may not be able to sell
specific Internet infrastructure services in international markets. There are
currently no federal laws or regulations that specifically control certificate
authorities, but a limited number of states have enacted legislation or
regulations with respect to certificate authorities. If the market for digital
certificates grows, the United States federal or state or non-United States
governments may choose to enact further regulations governing certificate
authorities or other providers of digital certificate products and related
services. These regulations or the costs of complying with these regulations
could harm our business.

   On July 3, 2000, President Bill Clinton signed a bill, as passed by
Congress, known as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce
Act, or "E-Sign." E-Sign is intended to render digital signatures legally
equivalent to those signed on paper. The execution of E-Sign could materially
and adversely affect our digital certificates services business. For example,
there may be an increasing demand for digital signatures and certificates as a
result of the new E-Sign law. However, due to competition or other reasons, our
services may not be adopted. If we cannot meet market expectations or demand
for our products and services does not increase, our business may be materially
and adversely affected. Furthermore, a successful implementation of E-Sign may
further encourage competitors to enter the marketplace because of the possible
increase in demand for digital signatures and certificates. This could
effectively lower barriers to entry and increasingly flood the marketplace with
competitors. While we cannot assure you that E-Sign will be effectively
implemented or how this implementation will affect our business, we must
continue to meet the demand and expectations of our customers, our failure to
do so could materially and adversely harm our business.

   We face risks related to intellectual property rights.

   Our success depends on our internally developed technologies and other
intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for a third
party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade
secrets without authorization. In addition, it is possible that others may
independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property. If we do
not effectively protect our intellectual property, our business could suffer.

   In the future we may have to resort to litigation to enforce our
intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the
validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This type of
litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result in substantial costs and
diversion of management and technical resources.

   We also license third-party technology, such as public key cryptography
technology licensed from RSA and other technology that is used in our products,
to perform key functions. These third-party technology licenses may not
continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our
business could suffer if we lost the rights to use these technologies. A third
party could claim that the licensed software infringes a patent or other
proprietary right. Litigation between the licensor and a third party or between
us and a third party could lead to royalty obligations for which we are not
indemnified or for which indemnification is insufficient, or we may not be able
to obtain any additional license on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

                                       32
<PAGE>

   The loss of, or our inability to obtain or maintain, any of these technology
licenses could delay the introduction of our Internet infrastructure services
until equivalent technology, if available, is identified, licensed and
integrated. This could harm our business.

   From time to time, we have received, and may receive in the future, notice
of claims of infringement of other parties' proprietary rights. Infringement or
other claims could be made against us in the future. Any claims, with or
without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and
diversion of technical and management personnel, cause product shipment delays
or require us to develop non-infringing technology or enter into royalty or
licensing agreements. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be
available on acceptable terms or at all. If a successful claim of product
infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing
technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-
effective basis, our business could be harmed.

   In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and
scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related
businesses are uncertain and still evolving. Because of the growth of the
Internet and Internet related businesses, patent applications are continuously
and simultaneously being filed in connection with Internet-related technology.
There are a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent
applications in our areas of interest, and we believe that there has been, and
is likely to continue to be, significant litigation in the industry regarding
patent and other intellectual property rights.

   VeriSign is party to legal proceedings that could have a negative financial
impact on it.

   We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot reasonably
estimate the potential impact of any of these proceedings. An adverse
determination in these cases or any other of these proceedings, however, could
harm our business. Legal proceedings in which we are involved are expensive and
divert the attention of our personnel.

   Our stock price, like that of many Internet companies, is highly volatile.

   The market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to
be highly volatile and significantly affected by factors such as:

  .  general market and economic conditions and market conditions affecting
     technology and Internet stocks generally;

  . actual or anticipated fluctuations in its quarterly or annual
    registrations or operating results;

  . announcements of technological innovations, acquisitions or investments,
    developments in Internet governance or corporate actions such as stock
    splits; and

  . industry conditions and trends.

   The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations
that have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology
companies, especially Internet-related companies. These broad market or
technology or Internet sector fluctuations may adversely affect the market
price of our common stock. Recently, the market price of our common stock, like
that of many Internet-related companies, has experienced significant
fluctuations. For instance, between January 1, 1999, and October 31, 2000, the
reported last sale price for our split-adjusted common stock ranged from $15.00
per share to $258.50 per share. On October 31, 2000, the reported last sale
price of our split-adjusted common stock was $132 per share.

   The market price of our common stock also has been and is likely to continue
to be significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors. Reports
and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views. The fact that
we have in the past met or exceeded analyst or investor expectations does not
necessarily mean that it will do so in the future.

                                       33
<PAGE>

   In the past, securities class action lawsuits have often followed periods of
volatility in the market price of a particular company's securities. This type
of litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of its
management's attention and resources.

   We have implemented anti-takeover provisions.

   Provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party
to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions
include:

  . our stockholders may only take action at a meeting and not by written
    consent;

  . our board must be given advance notice regarding stockholder-sponsored
    proposals for consideration at annual meetings and for stockholder
    nominations for the election of directors;

  . we have a classified board of directors, with the board being divided
    into three classes that serve staggered three-year terms;

  . vacancies on our board may be filled until the next annual meeting of
    stockholders only by majority vote of the directors then in office; and

  . special meetings of our stockholders may only be called by the Chairman
    of the Board, the President or by the board, not by our stockholders.

   While we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a
higher bid by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of
directors, these provisions may apply even if the offer may be considered
beneficial by some stockholders.

</TABLE>

   At September 30, 2000, our principal source of liquidity was approximately
$1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting
principally of commercial paper, medium term notes, corporate bonds and notes,
market auction securities, United States government agency securities and money
market funds. In addition, we hold $243.6 million of long-term equity minority
investments and corporate debt securities.

   Net cash provided by operating activities was $151.1 million in the first
nine months of 2000 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of
$3.5 million in the first nine months of 1999. The increase was primarily due
to an overall increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and our
deferred revenue balance in which we receive payment in advance for many of our
products and services.

   Net cash provided by investing activities was $214.6 million in the first
nine months of 2000 compared to net cash used of $88.4 million in the first
nine months of 1999. In the first nine months of 2000, net cash provided by
investing activities was primarily the result of the cash acquired in our
acquisitions, partially offset by increased purchases of short and long-term
investments, and costs relating to our acquisitions. Capital expenditures for
property and equipment totaled $32.1 million in the first nine months of 2000
and $4.3 million in the first nine months of 1999. As of September 30, 2000, we
also had commitments under noncancelable operating leases for our facilities
for various terms through 2005. During October 2000, the Company entered into
three new noncancelable operating leases for facilities with commitment terms
through 2011.


                                       34
<PAGE>

   Net cash provided by financing activities was $61.1 million in the first
nine months of 2000 resulting primarily from the issuance of common stock for
stock option exercises. In the first nine months of 1999, net cash provided by
financing activities was $131.5 million, primarily from the sale of additional
common stock to the public.

   We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, at
some time, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private
financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. This additional
funding, if needed, might not be available on terms attractive to us, or at
all. Failure to raise capital when needed could materially harm our business.
If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, the
percentage of our stock owned by our then-current stockholders will be reduced.
Furthermore, these equity securities might have rights, preferences or
privileges senior to those of our common stock.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 established methods of
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related
to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. We expect that the
adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have no material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. We will be required to implement
SFAS No. 133 for the year ending December 31, 2001.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest rate sensitivity

   The primary objective of VeriSign's investment activities is to preserve
principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our
investments without significantly increasing risk. Some of the securities that
we have invested in may be subject to market risk. This means that a change in
prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to
fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed
interest rate at the then-prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate
later rises, the principal amount of our investment will probably decline in
value. To minimize this risk, we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents
and short-term investments in a variety of securities, including commercial
paper, medium-term notes, corporate bonds and notes, market auction
securities, U.S. government and agency securities and money market funds. In
general, money market funds are not subject to market risk because the
interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. In
addition, we generally invest in relatively short-term securities. As of
September 30, 2000, 98% of our non-strategic investments mature in less than
one year.

   The following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and
investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and
weighted-average interest rates as of September 30, 2000. This table does not
include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk.

Exchange rate risk

   VeriSign considers its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations to be minimal. All revenues derived from affiliates other than
VeriSign Japan are denominated in United States Dollars and, therefore, are
not subject to exchange rate fluctuations.

   Both the revenues and expenses of our majority-owned subsidiary in Japan
are denominated in Japanese Yen, and the revenues and expenses of our
activities conducted through South Africa are denominated in South African
Rand. In both regions, we believe this serves as a natural hedge against
exchange rate fluctuations because although an unfavorable change in the
exchange rate of the foreign currency against the United States Dollar will
result in lower revenues when translated to United States Dollars, operating
expenses will also be lower in these circumstances. Our subsidiaries in Sweden
and Hong Kong have not had significant operations to date.

   Because of our minimal exposure to foreign currencies, we have not engaged
in any hedging transactions to date.

Equity price risk

   We own shares of common stock of certain public companies. We value these
investments using the closing fair market value stated in the Wall Street
Journal for the last day of each month. These investments are subject to
market price volatility. We reflect these investments in our balance sheet at
their market value, with the unrealized gains and losses excluded from
earnings and reported in the "Accumulated other comprehensive income"
component of stockholders' equity. As a result of recent market price
volatility of our publicly traded investments, we experienced a $23.1 million
unrealized loss on these investments during the third quarter of 2000. In
addition, we have invested in equity instruments of several privately held
companies many of which can still be considered in the startup or development
stages. These investments are accounted for under the cost method. We do not
hedge against equity price changes.

                           PART II--OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   As of October 31, 2000, Network Solutions, Inc. was a defendant in seventeen
active lawsuits involving domain name disputes between trademark owners and
domain name holders. Network Solutions is drawn into such disputes, in part, as
a result of claims by trademark owners that Network Solutions is legally
required, upon request by a trademark owner, to terminate the contractual right
between Network Solutions and a domain name holder that registered a domain
name, which is alleged to be similar to the trademark in question. On October
25, 1999, however, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Network
Solutions' favor and against Lockheed Corporation, holding that Network
Solutions' services do not make Network Solutions liable for contributory
infringement to trademark owners. Thus, Network Solutions believes, this type
of suit should decline in frequency. The holders of the domain name
registrations in dispute have, in turn, questioned our right, absent a court
order, to take any action that affects their contractual rights to the domain
names in question. Although 82 of these kinds of situations over the past six
and a half years have resulted in suits actually naming Network Solutions as a
defendant, as of October 31, 2000, no adverse judgment has been rendered and no
award of damages has ever been made against Network Solutions. Network
Solutions believes that it has meritorious defenses and vigorously defends
itself against these claims.

   On January 13, 2000, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a
Civil Investigative Demand seeking information and documents concerning the
then-pending acquisition by VeriSign of THAWTE. VeriSign provided certain
information and documents to the Department of Justice, and closed the THAWTE
transaction on February 1, 2000. VeriSign completed its initial response to the
Civil Investigative Demand on March 1, 2000, and a supplemental production of
documents was completed May 9, 2000. On September 14, 2000, VeriSign was
notified that senior officials at the Department of Justice had reviewed a
report by the investigatory staff regarding the transaction, and that the
Department had concerns about the potential competitive effects of the
transaction. Representatives of VeriSign met with and provided additional
information to the Department of Justice during October 2000. The Department of
Justice ultimately may raise objections to the transaction that would require
VeriSign to negotiate a settlement with the Department of Justice to resolve
such objections, or to defend against a legal action challenging the
transaction. While VeriSign believes the transaction does not violate the
antitrust laws, it is possible for there to be a settlement or adverse court
ruling that could have an adverse material effect on the Company, and may
include the licensing or divestiture of assets acquired in the transaction.

   On March 15, 2000, a group of eight plaintiffs filed suit against the United
States Department of Commerce, the National Science Foundation and Network
Solutions, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California. The case, entitled William Hoefer et al. v. U.S. Department of
Commerce, et al., Civil Action No. 000918-VRW, challenged the lawfulness of the
registration fees that Network Solutions was authorized to charge for domain
name registrations from September 1995 to November 1999. The suit purports to
be brought on behalf of all domain name registrants who paid registration fees
during that period and seeks approximately $1.7 billion in damages. On June 19,
2000 the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, adding two plaintiffs
and naming VeriSign as a defendant.

   All of the defendants filed motions to transfer the suit to the Federal
District Court in the District of Columbia and the court granted those motions
on June 28, 2000. The same attorney who unsuccessfully challenged Network
Solutions in a similar action known as Thomas, et al. v. Network Solutions, et
al., filed this new action on behalf of eight former and current domain name
registrants. The suit contains eight causes of action against the defendants
based on alleged violations of Art. I, Section 8 and the Fifth Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution, the Independent Offices Appropriations Act (31 U.S.C.
Section 9701), the Administrative Procedure Act, the Sherman Act, and the
California Unfair Competition Act, Section 17200. The case was docketed with
the Federal District Court in the District of Columbia on July 28, 2000 and on
August 4, 2000 the plaintiffs dismissed the case. Four days later, the same
attorney refiled the same case in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia. Network Solutions filed a motion to dismiss the
case and the

                                       37
<PAGE>

plaintiffs responded by filing a First Amended Complaint on September 7, 2000.
We now have refiled another Motion to Dismiss. The current versions of the suit
does not name VeriSign as a defendant. The suit contains fourteen causes of
action against the Appropriations Act (31 U.S.C. Section 9701), the
Administrative Procedure Act, the Chief Financial Officer's Act (31 U.S.C.
Section 902), and the Sherman Act. On October 10, 2000, Network Solutions filed
its motion to dismiss the case. On October 24, 2000, the National Science
Foundation filed a motion to transfer the case back to the Federal District
Court in the District of Columbia.

   On June 15, 2000, plaintiff David Moran filed a putative shareholder
derivative complaint on behalf of himself and others similarly situated against
Charles Stuckey, Jr., James Bidzos, Richard L. Earnest, Dr. Taher Elgamal,
James K. Sims, Joseph B. Lassiter III, Robert P. Badavas, and against nominal
defendant VeriSign, Inc. The case is captioned Moran v. Stuckey, et.al., No.
1810 NC (Del. Ch. 2000). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the
directors of RSA Security mismanaged RSA's business, failed to protect its
intellectual property or enforce the terms of its license agreement with
VeriSign, and that VeriSign violated the terms of the licensing agreement and
competed against RSA. On August 2, 2000, a second shareholder complaint was
filed against the Company and the aforementioned directors of RSA Security,
Inc. by plaintiff James V. Biglan. That case is captioned Biglan v. Stuckey, et
al. Civ. Action No. 18190NC (Del. Ch. 2000). On September 25, 2000 the Court
ordered the cases consolidated under the Moran caption and named lead counsel
for plaintiffs in this matter. Defendants are to respond to the Complaint no
later than December 11, 2000. While VeriSign cannot ascertain the outcome of
this matter presently, VeriSign believes that the claims against it are without
merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against these claims.

   VeriSign is involved in various other investigations, claims and lawsuits
arising in the normal conduct of our business, none of which, in our opinion
will harm our business. VeriSign cannot assure that it will prevail in any
litigation. Regardless of the outcome, any litigation may require VeriSign to
incur significant litigation expense and may result in significant diversion of
management attention. An unfavorable outcome may have a material adverse effect
on VeriSign's financial position or results of operations.

applicable zoning laws only for the following purposes and shall not change the

spaces allocated to Tenant under this Lease.  All commercial trucks and delivery
vehicles shall (i) be parked at the rear of the Building, (ii) loaded and

Landlord makes no representation or warranty that any specific use of the
Premises desired by Tenant is permitted pursuant to any Laws.

  B. Uses Prohibited:    Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed on
the Premises any waste, nuisance, or other act or thing which may disturb the
quiet enjoyment of any other tenant in or around the Premises, nor allow any
sale by auction or any other use of the Premises for an unlawful purpose. Tenant
shall not (i) damage or overload the electrical, mechanical or plumbing systems
of the Premises, (ii) attach, hang or suspend anything from the ceiling, walls
or columns of the building in excess of the load limits for which such items are
designed or set any load on the floor in excess of the load limits for which for
which the floor is designed, or (iii) generate dust, fumes or waste products
which create a fire or health hazard or damage the Premises or any portion of
the Project, including without limitation the soils or ground water in or around
the Project.  No materials, supplies, equipment, finished products or semi-
finished products, raw materials or articles of any nature, or any waste
materials, refuse, scrap or debris, shall be stored upon or permitted to remain
on any portion of the Premises outside of the Building without Landlord's prior
approval, which approval may be withheld in its reasonable discretion.

  C. Advertisements and Signs:    Tenant will not place or permit to be placed,
in, upon or about the Premises any signs in violation of the city and other
governing authority having jurisdiction.  Tenant will not place or permit to be
placed upon the Premises any large prominent outdoor signs, advertisements or
notices without the written consent of Landlord as to type, size, design,
lettering, coloring and location, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.  Any sign placed on the Premises shall be removed by Tenant, at its
sole cost, prior to the Expiration Date or promptly following the earlier
termination of the Lease, and Tenant shall repair, at its sole cost, any damage
or injury to the Premises caused thereby, and if not so removed, then Landlord
may have same so removed at Tenant's expense.

  D. Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions:   This Lease is subject to the
effect of (i) any covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, mortgages or
deeds of trust, ground leases, rights of way of record and any other matters or
documents of record; and (ii) any

                                    Page 2
<PAGE>

zoning laws of the city, county and state where the Building is situated
(collectively referred to herein as "Restrictions") and Tenant will conform to
and will not violate the terms of any such Restrictions.

4.  TERM AND RENTAL:

  A. Base Monthly Rent:    The term ("Lease Term") shall be for one hundred
thirty two (132) months, commencing November 1, 2000 ("Commencement Date"), and
ending October 31, 2011 ("Expiration Date").  Notwithstanding the parties'
agreement that the Lease Term begins on the Commencement Date, this Lease and
all of the obligations of Landlord and Tenant shall be binding and in full force
and effect from and after the Effective Date.  In addition to all other sums
payable by Tenant under this Lease, Tenant shall pay base monthly rent ("Base
Monthly Rent") for the Premises according to the following schedule:

Months 01-12:       $243,750.00 per month
Months 13-24:       $253,500.00 per month
Months 25-36:       $263,640.00 per month
Months 37-48:       $274,186.00 per month
Months 49-60:       $285,153.00 per month
Months 61-72:       $296,559.00 per month
Months 73-84:       $308,422.00 per month
Months 85-96:       $320,758.00 per month
Months 97-108:      $333,589.00 per month
Months 109-120:     $346,932.00 per month
Months 121-132:     $360,810.00 per month

Base Monthly Rent shall be due in advance on or before the first day of each
calendar month during the Lease Term.  All sums payable by Tenant under this
Lease shall be paid to Landlord in lawful money of the United States of America,
without offset or deduction and without prior notice or demand, at the address
specified in Section 1 of this Lease or at such place or places as may be
designated in writing by Landlord during the Lease Term.  Base Monthly Rent for
any period less than a calendar month shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly
installment.  Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord the sum of $243,750.00 as prepaid rent for the first month of
the Lease.

  B. Late Charges:    Tenant hereby acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to
Landlord of Base Monthly Rent and other sums due hereunder will cause Landlord
to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which is
extremely difficult to ascertain.  Such costs include but are not limited to:
administrative, processing, accounting, and late charges which may be imposed on
Landlord by the terms of any contract, revolving credit, mortgage, or trust deed
covering the Premises.  Accordingly, if any installment of Base Monthly Rent or
other sum due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or its designee
within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of written notice from
Landlord that such installment or sum was not received when due, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord a late charge equal to five (5%) percent of such overdue amount,
which late charge shall be due and payable on the same date that the overdue
amount was due. The parties agree that such late charge represents a fair and
reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late payment
by Tenant, excluding interest and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  If any
rent or other sum due from Tenant remains delinquent for a period in excess of
thirty (30) days then, in addition to such late charge, Tenant shall pay to
Landlord interest on any rent that is not paid when due at the Agreed Interest
Rate specified in Section 19.J following the date such amount became due until
paid.  Acceptance by Landlord of such late charge shall not constitute a waiver
of Tenant's default with respect to such overdue amount nor prevent Landlord
from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.  In the
event that a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for
four (4) consecutive installments of Base Monthly Rent, then the Base Monthly
Rent shall automatically become due and payable quarterly in advance, rather
than monthly, notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary.

  C. Security Deposit:    Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease,
Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of Two Hundred Forty Three Thousand
Five Hundred and No/100 Dollars ($243,500.00) ("Security "Deposit"). Landlord
shall not be deemed a trustee of the Security Deposit, may use the Security
Deposit in business, and shall not be required to segregate it from its general
accounts. Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on the Security Deposit.  If
Tenant defaults with respect to any provisions of the Lease, including but not
limited to the provisions relating to payment of Base Monthly Rent or other
charges, Landlord may, to the extent reasonably necessary to remedy Tenant's
default, use any or

                                    Page 3
<PAGE>

all of the Security Deposit towards payment of the following: (i) Base Monthly
Rent or other charges in default; (ii) any other amount which Landlord may spend
or become obligated to spend by reason of Tenant's default including, but not
limited to Tenant's failure to restore or clean the Premises following vacation
thereof. If any portion of the Security Deposit is so used or applied, Tenant
shall, within ten (10) days after written demand from Landlord, deposit cash
with Landlord in an amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its
full original amount, and shall pay to Landlord such other sums as necessary to
reimburse Landlord for any sums paid by Landlord. If Tenant shall be in either
monetary default or material non-monetary default more than four (4) times in
any twelve (12) month period, then the Security Deposit shall, within ten (10)
days after demand by Landlord, be increased by Tenant to an amount equal to
three (3) times the Base Monthly Rent. Tenant may not assign or encumber the
Security Deposit without the consent of Landlord. Any attempt to do so shall be
void and shall not be binding on Landlord. The Security Deposit shall be
returned to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the Expiration Date and
surrender of the Premises to Landlord, less any amount deducted in accordance
with this Section, together with Landlord's written notice itemizing the amounts
and purposes for such deduction. In the event of termination of Landlord's
interest in this Lease, Landlord may deliver or credit the Security Deposit to
Landlord's successor in interest in the Premises and thereupon be relieved of
further responsibility with respect to the Security Deposit.

Landlord agrees that in lieu of a cash Security Deposit, Tenant may deposit a
letter of credit ("Letter of Credit") substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit "B".  Landlord shall be entitled to draw against the Letter of Credit
   -----------
at any time provided only that Landlord certifies to the issuer of the Letter of
Credit that Tenant is in default under the Lease.  Tenant shall keep the letter
of credit in effect during the entire Lease Term, as the same may be extended,
plus a period of four (4) weeks after expiration of the Lease Term.  At least
thirty (30) days prior to expiration of any Letter of Credit, the term thereof
shall be renewed or extended for a period of at least one (1) year.  Tenant's
failure to so renew or extend the Letter of Credit shall be a material default
of this Lease by Tenant.  In the event Landlord draws against the Letter of
Credit, Tenant shall replenish the existing Letter of Credit or cause a new
Letter of Credit to be issued such that the aggregate amount of letters of
credit available to Landlord at all times during the Lease Term is the amount of
the Security Deposit originally required.

5.  CONSTRUCTION:

  A. Landlord's Obligations:    Except as specifically provided in this
paragraph, prior to Commencement Date Landlord shall ensure that the existing
Building and Building systems are in good operating condition and repair
including the foundation, structural components, exterior walls, plumbing, HVAC,
sprinklers, electrical (including panels and outlets), doors (both shipping and
personnel), roof structure and membrane, exterior landscaping, irrigation and
lighting, and parking lot.  "Good operating condition and repair" as used in
this paragraph means that all of the foregoing systems for which Landlord is
responsible shall be fully operational and functional for use for the purposes
for which such systems were intended, and there is no deferred maintenance
required.  Without limitation of the foregoing:  (i) the roof membrane shall be
inspected by a reputable and licensed roofing contractor or roofing inspector
and repaired as necessary to put into good operating condition and repair based
on such inspection; (ii) the HVAC system shall be inspected by a reputable and
licensed HVAC contractor and repaired as necessary to put into good operating
condition and repair based on such inspection, as evidenced by a report by such
contractor; (iii) all windows shall be washed inside and out, and there shall be
no cracked or broken windows; (iv) all burned out, discolored or broken
lightbulbs, ballasts and lenses shall be replaced; and (v) the parking lot shall
be re-sealed and striped by a reputable and licensed asphalt contractor
provided, however, that Landlord shall have sixty days from the Commencement
Date to complete the parking lot re-sealing and striping.

6.  ACCEPTANCE OF POSSESSION AND COVENANTS TO SURRENDER:

  A. Delivery and Acceptance:    On the Commencement Date, Landlord shall
deliver and Tenant shall accept possession of the Premises.  Tenant acknowledges
that it has had an opportunity to conduct, and has conducted, such inspections
of the Premises as it deems

                                    Page 4
<PAGE>

necessary to evaluate its condition. Except as otherwise specifically provided
herein, Tenant agrees to accept possession of the Premises in its then existing
condition, subject to all Restrictions and without representation or warranty by
Landlord.

  B. Early Access:    Tenant shall be allowed early access and occupancy of the
Premises from September 1, 2000 until the Commencement Date ("Early Access
Period") for the purpose of constructing Tenant Improvements and otherwise
preparing for its occupancy.  Tenant shall be subject to all the terms and
conditions of the Lease during the Early Access Period except that no Base
Monthly Rent or other expenses shall be due or payable.

  C. Condition Upon Surrender:    Tenant further agrees on the Expiration Date
or on the sooner termination of this Lease, to surrender the Premises to
Landlord in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted.  In this
regard, "normal wear and tear" shall be construed to mean wear and tear caused
to the Premises by the natural aging process which occurs in spite of prudent
application of the best standards for maintenance, repair replacement, and
janitorial practices, and does not include items of neglected or deferred
maintenance.  In any event, Tenant shall cause the following to be done prior to
the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease: (i) all interior walls
shall be painted or cleaned so that they appear freshly painted, (ii) all tiled
floors shall be cleaned and waxed, (iii) all carpets shall be cleaned and
shampooed, (iv) all broken, marred, stained or nonconforming acoustical ceiling
tiles shall be replaced, (v) all cabling placed above the ceiling by Tenant or
Tenant's contractors shall be removed unless such cabling has been placed in
trays especially designed for such purpose and is not weighing directly on the
ceiling, (vi) all windows shall be washed; (vii) the HVAC system shall be
serviced by a reputable and licensed service firm and left in "good operating
condition and repair" as evidenced by a report by such firm, (viii) the plumbing
and electrical systems and lighting shall be placed in good order and repair
(including replacement of any burned out, discolored or broken light bulbs,
ballasts, or lenses. On or before the Expiration Date or sooner termination of
this Lease, Tenant shall remove all its personal property and trade fixtures
from the Premises.  All property and fixtures not so removed shall be deemed as
abandoned by Tenant.  At the expiration of the Lease Term, Landlord shall not
have the right to require that Tenant remove from the Premises any Alterations
(as defined in Section 7 below) made with Landlord's consent unless Landlord, at
the time of granting such consent, indicates that the subject Alteration must be
removed upon the expiration of the Lease Term.  With respect to Permitted
Alterations as defined in Section 7A. below, Tenant shall ascertain from
Landlord within ninety (90) days before the Expiration Date whether Landlord
desires to have such Permitted Alterations removed.  If Landlord so elects,
Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove such Alterations as Landlord
has required and shall repair and restore the affected areas of the Premises
prior to the Expiration Date to a standard open office plan with materials and
finishes consistent with the other open office areas within the Premises.  Such
repair and restoration shall include causing the Premises to be brought into
compliance with all applicable building codes and laws in effect at the time of
the removal to the extent such compliance is necessitated by the repair and
restoration work.

  D. Failure to Surrender:    If the Premises are not surrendered at the
Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease in the condition required by
this Section 6, Tenant shall be deemed in a holdover tenancy pursuant to this
Section 6.D. and Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold Landlord harmless
against loss or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the
Premises including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding tenant
founded on such delay and costs incurred by Landlord in returning the Premises
to the required condition, plus interest at the Agreed Interest Rate.   Any
holding over after the termination or Expiration Date with Landlord's express
written consent, shall be construed as month-to-month tenancy, terminable on
thirty (30) days written notice from either party, and Tenant shall pay as Base
Monthly Rent to Landlord a rate equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%)
of the Base Monthly Rent due in the month preceding the termination or
Expiration Date, plus all other amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease.  Any
holding over shall otherwise be on the terms and conditions herein specified,
except those provisions relating to the Lease Term and any options to extend or
renew, which provisions shall be of no further force and effect following the
expiration of the applicable exercise period.  If Tenant remains in

                                    Page 5
<PAGE>

possession of the Premises after the Expiration Date or sooner termination of
this Lease without Landlord's consent, Tenant's continued possession shall be on
the basis of a tenancy at sufferance and Tenant shall pay as rent during the
holdover period an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base
Monthly Rent due in the month preceding the termination or Expiration Date, plus
all other amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease. This provision shall
survive the termination or expiration of the Lease.

7.  ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS:

  A. Tenant's Alterations:    Tenant shall not make, or suffer to be made, any
alteration or addition to the Premises ("Alterations"), or any part thereof,
without obtaining Landlord's prior written consent and delivering to Landlord
the proposed architectural and structural plans for all such Alterations at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the start of construction.  If such Alterations
affect the structure of the Building, Tenant additionally agrees to reimburse
Landlord its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in reviewing Tenant's
plans.  After obtaining Landlord's consent, which consent shall state whether or
not Landlord will require Tenant to remove such Alteration at the expiration or
earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall not proceed to make such
Alterations until Tenant has obtained all required governmental approvals and
permits.  Tenant agrees to provide Landlord (i) written notice of the
anticipated and actual start-date of the work, (ii) a complete set of half-size
(15" X 21") vellum as-built drawings, and (iii) a certificate of occupancy for
the work upon completion of the Alterations.  All Alterations shall be
constructed in compliance with all applicable building codes and laws including,
without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended from
time to time.  Upon the Expiration Date, all Alterations, except movable
furniture and trade fixtures, shall become a part of the realty and belong to
Landlord but shall nevertheless be subject to removal by Tenant as provided in
Section 6 above.  Alterations which are not deemed as trade fixtures include
heating, lighting, electrical systems, air conditioning, walls, carpeting, or
any other installation which has become an integral part of the Premises
(excepting backup power generators or a UPS system, which Tenant shall have the
right to remove).  All Alterations shall be maintained, replaced or repaired by
Tenant at its sole cost and expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled, without obtaining
Landlord's consent, to make Alterations which do not affect the structure of the
Building and which do not cost more than Seventy Thousand Dollars ($70,000.00)
per Alteration ("Permitted Alterations"); provided, however, that:  (i) Tenant
shall still be required to comply with all other provisions of this paragraph;
and (ii) such Permitted Alterations are subject to removal by Tenant at
Landlord's election pursuant to Section 6.C. above at the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease.

  B. Free From Liens:    Tenant shall keep the Premises free from all liens
arising out of work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by
Tenant or claimed to have been performed for Tenant.  In the event Tenant fails
to discharge any such lien within sixty (60) days after receiving notice of the
filing, Landlord shall be entitled to discharge the lien at Tenant's expense and
all resulting costs incurred by Landlord, including attorney's fees shall be due
from Tenant as additional rent.

  C. Compliance With Governmental Regulations: The term Laws or Governmental
Regulations shall include all federal, state, county, city or governmental
agency laws, statutes, ordinances, standards, rules, requirements, or orders now
in force or hereafter enacted, promulgated, or issued.  The term also includes
government measures regulating or enforcing public access, traffic mitigation,
occupational, health, or safety standards for employers, employees, landlords,
or tenants. Tenant, at Tenant's sole expense shall make all repairs,
replacements, alterations, or improvements needed to comply with all
Governmental Regulations.  The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction
or the admission of Tenant in any action or proceeding against Tenant (whether
Landlord be a party thereto or not) that Tenant has violated any such law,
regulation or other requirement in its use of the Premises shall be conclusive
of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant.

The foregoing notwithstanding, if any repair, replacement, alteration or
improvement is required to the Building foundation, exterior load bearing walls,
roof structure or any other structural component of the Building (excluding
structural components installed by Tenant) as a

                                    Page 6
<PAGE>

result of any Governmental Regulations and such required work is not caused by
Tenant's specific use or Alterations, the cost of such repair, replacement,
alteration or improvement shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant such
that Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon completion of such work, the portion of
the cost equal to the product of such cost multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of years remaining in the Lease Term, the
denominator of which is the useful life (in years) of the repair, replacement,
alteration or addition; provided, however, that if the Tenant thereafter
exercises a renewal option, then upon Tenant's exercise of the renewal option,
the numerator of the fraction shall be adjusted to the sum of: (i) the Lease
Term remaining at the time the repair, replacement, alteration or addition was
made; and (ii) the number of years in the Option Term; and Landlord's
reimbursement obligation shall immediately thereafter be re-calculated.

8.  MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES:

  A. Landlord's Obligations:    Landlord at its sole cost and expense, shall
maintain in good condition, order, and repair, and replace as and when
necessary, the foundation, exterior load bearing walls and roof structure, and
all other structural components of the Building, excluding any components
installed by Tenant.

  B. Tenant's Obligations:    Tenant shall clean, maintain, repair and replace
when necessary the Premises and every part thereof through regular inspections
and servicing, including but not limited to: (i) all plumbing and sewage
facilities, (ii) all heating ventilating and air conditioning facilities and
equipment, (iii) all fixtures, interior walls floors, carpets and ceilings, (iv)
all windows, door entrances, plate glass and glazing systems including caulking,
and skylights, (v) all electrical facilities and equipment, (vi) all automatic
fire extinguisher equipment, (vii) the parking lot and all underground utility
facilities servicing the Premises, (viii) the roof membrane system, and (ix) all
waterscape, landscaping and shrubbery. All wall surfaces and floor tile are to
be maintained in an as good a condition as when Tenant took possession free of
holes, gouges, or defacements.   With respect to items (ii) and (viii) above,
Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of a service contract between Tenant and a
licensed service contractor providing for periodic maintenance of all such
systems or equipment in conformance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of such preventive maintenance contracts
and paid invoices for the recommended work if requested by Landlord.

If as a part of Tenant's fulfillment of its maintenance obligations during the
last three (3) years of the Lease Term a replacement of the roof membrane is
necessary, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of the replacement less
the sum of (i) Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) plus (ii) that portion of
the cost over $30,000.00 equal to the product of such cost multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years remaining in the Lease
Term, the denominator of which is the useful life (in years) of the roof
replacement; provided, however, that if the roof replacement is made during the
initial Lease Term and Tenant thereafter exercises a renewal option, then upon
Tenant's exercise of the renewal option, the numerator of the fraction shall be
adjusted to the sum of:  (i) the Lease Term remaining at the time the roof
replacement was made; and (ii) the number of years in the Option Term; and
Landlord's reimbursement obligation shall immediately thereafter be re-
calculated.

  C. Common Area Cost Sharing:    Pursuant to Tenant's maintenance obligations
under this Lease, Tenant is solely responsible for the Common Area so long as it
is leasing all buildings within the Project.  In the event Tenant does not lease
all buildings within the Project, Tenant shall remain obligated for such
expenses; however, the Lease shall be amended to provide for Landlord's
management of the Common Area and reimbursement by Tenant of only its pro rata
share, such share to be calculated based on leased square footage within the
Project.

  D. Waiver of Liability:     Failure by Landlord to perform any defined
services, or any cessation thereof, when such failure is caused by accident,
breakage, repairs, strikes, lockout or other labor disturbances or labor
disputes of any character or by any other cause, similar or dissimilar, shall
not render Landlord liable to Tenant in any respect, including damages to either
person or property, except to the extent due to Landlord's active negligence or
willful misconduct, nor be construed as an eviction of Tenant, nor cause an
abatement of rent, nor relieve Tenant from fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement hereof.  Should any equipment or machinery utilized in supplying the
services listed herein break down or for any

                                    Page 7
<PAGE>

cause cease to function properly, upon receipt of written notice from Tenant of
any deficiency or failure of any services, Landlord shall use reasonable
diligence to repair the same promptly, but Tenant shall have no right to
terminate this Lease and shall have no claim for rebate of rent or damages on
account of any interruptions in service occasioned thereby or resulting
therefrom, except to the extent due to Landlord's active negligence or willful
misconduct. Tenant waives the provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1941
and 1942 concerning the Landlord's obligation of tenantability and Tenant's
right to make repairs and deduct the cost of such repairs from the rent.
Landlord shall not be liable for a loss of or injury to person or property,
however occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to furnishing, or
its failure to furnish, any of the foregoing.

9.  HAZARD INSURANCE:

  A. Tenant's Use:    Tenant shall not use or permit the Premises, or any part
thereof, to be used for any purpose other than that for which the Premises are
hereby leased; and no use of the Premises shall be made or permitted, nor acts
done, which will cause an increase in premiums or a cancellation of any
insurance policy covering the Premises or any part thereof, nor shall Tenant
sell or permit to be sold, kept, or used in or about the Premises, any article
prohibited by the standard form of fire insurance policies.  Tenant shall, at
its sole cost, comply with all requirements of any insurance company or
organization necessary for the maintenance of reasonable fire and public
liability insurance covering the Premises and appurtenances.

  B. Landlord's Insurance:    Landlord agrees to purchase and keep in force
fire, extended coverage insurance in an amount equal to the replacement cost of
the Building (not including any Tenant Improvements or Alterations paid for by
Tenant) as determined by Landlord's insurance company's appraisers. At
Landlord's election, such fire and property damage insurance may be endorsed to
cover loss caused by such additional perils against which Landlord may elect to
insure, including earthquake and/or flood, and shall contain reasonable
deductibles.  Additionally Landlord may maintain a policy of (i) commercial
general liability insurance insuring Landlord (and such others designated by
Landlord) against liability for personal injury, bodily injury, death and damage
to property occurring or resulting from an occurrence in, on or about the
Premises or Project in an amount as Landlord determines is reasonably necessary
for its protection, and (ii) rental loss insurance covering a twelve (12) month
period. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord as additional rent, on demand, the full
cost of said insurance as evidenced by insurance billings to Landlord, and in
the event of damage covered by said insurance, the amount of any deductible
under such policy.  Payment shall be due to Landlord within ten (10) days after
written invoice to Tenant.  It is understood and agreed that Tenant's obligation
under this Section will be prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and
Expiration Dates.

  C. Tenant's Insurance:    Tenant agrees, at its sole cost, to insure its
personal property, Tenant Improvements, and Alterations for their full
replacement value (without depreciation) and to obtain worker's compensation and
public liability and property damage insurance for occurrences within the
Premises with a combined single limit of not less than Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000.00).  Tenant's liability insurance shall be primary insurance
containing a cross-liability endorsement, and shall provide coverage on an
"occurrence" rather than on a "claims made" basis.  Tenant shall name Landlord
and Landlord's lender as an additional insured and shall deliver a copy of the
policies and renewal certificates to Landlord.  All such policies shall provide
for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord of any cancellation,
termination, or reduction in coverage.

  D. Waiver:    Landlord and Tenant hereby waive all rights each may have
against the other on account of any loss or damage sustained by Landlord or
Tenant, as the case may be, or to the Premises or its contents, which may arise
from any risk covered by their respective insurance policies (or which would
have been covered had such insurance policies been maintained in accordance with
this Lease) as set forth above.  The Parties shall use their reasonable efforts
to obtain from their respective insurance companies a waiver of any right of
subrogation which said insurance company may have against Landlord or Tenant, as
the case may be.

10.  TAXES:    Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay as additional rental,
prior to delinquency, the following:  (i) all taxes and assessments levied
against Tenant's personal property and

                                    Page 8
<PAGE>

trade or business fixtures; (ii) all real estate taxes and assessment
installments or other impositions or charges which may be levied on the Premises
or upon the occupancy of the Premises, including any substitute or additional
charges which may be imposed applicable to the Lease Term; and (iii) real estate
tax increases due to an increase in assessed value resulting from a sale,
transfer or other change of ownership of the Premises as it appears on the City
and County tax bills during the Lease Term. All real estate taxes shall be
prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and Expiration Dates. If, at any time
during the Lease Term a tax, excise on rents, business license tax or any other
tax, however described, is levied or assessed against Landlord as a substitute
or addition, in whole or in part, for taxes assessed or imposed on land or
Buildings, Tenant shall pay and discharge its pro rata share of such tax or
excise on rents or other tax before it becomes delinquent; except that this
provision is not intended to cover net income taxes, inheritance, gift or estate
tax imposed upon Landlord. In the event that a tax is placed, levied, or
assessed against Landlord and the taxing authority takes the position that
Tenant cannot pay and discharge its pro rata share of such tax on behalf of
Landlord, then Landlord may increase the Base Monthly Rent by the exact amount
of such tax and Tenant shall pay such increase. If by virtue of any application
or proceeding brought by Landlord, there results a reduction in the assessed
value of the Premises during the Lease Term, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord a fee
consistent with the fees charged by a third party appeal firm for such services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if property taxes increase during the first three
years of the Lease Term as a result of a reassessment due to a voluntary change
of ownership, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of the resulting property
tax increase as follows:  during the first twelve months, Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of thirty three percent (33%) of the tax increase;
during the second twelve months, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of
sixty seven percent (67%) of the tax increase, thereafter Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of the entire tax increase.

11.  UTILITIES:    Tenant shall pay directly to the providing utility all water,
gas, electric, telephone, and other utilities supplied to the Premises.
Landlord shall not be liable for loss of or injury to person or property,
however occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to furnishing or
the utility company's failure to furnish utilities to the Premises, and in such
event Tenant shall not be entitled to abatement or reduction of any portion of
Base Monthly Rent or any other amount payable under this Lease.

12.  TOXIC WASTE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE:

  A. Tenant's Responsibility:    Without the prior written consent of Landlord,
Tenant or Tenant's agents, employees, contractors and invitees ("Tenant's
Agents") shall not bring, use, or permit upon the Premises, or generate, create,
release, emit, or dispose (nor permit any of the same) from the Premises any
chemicals, toxic or hazardous gaseous, liquid or solid materials or waste,
including without limitation, material or substance having characteristics of
ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity or substances or materials
which are listed on any of the Environmental Protection Agency's lists of
hazardous wastes or which are identified in Division 22 Title 26 of the
California Code of Regulations as the same may be amended from time to time or
any other similar wastes, materials or substances which are or may become
regulated by or under the authority of any applicable local, state or federal
laws, judgments, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, codes or other
governmental restrictions, guidelines or requirements ("Hazardous Materials")
except for those substances customary in typical office uses for which no
consent shall be required.  In order to obtain consent, Tenant shall deliver to
Landlord its written proposal describing the toxic material to be brought onto
the Premises, measures to be taken for storage and disposal thereof, safety
measures to be employed to prevent pollution of the air, ground, surface and
ground water.  Landlord's approval may be withheld in its reasonable judgment.
In the event Landlord consents to Tenant's use of Hazardous Materials on the
Premises or such consent is not required, Tenant represents and warrants that it
shall comply with all Governmental Regulations applicable to Hazardous Materials
including doing the following:  (i) adhere to all reporting and inspection
requirements imposed by Federal, State, County or Municipal laws, ordinances or
regulations and will provide Landlord a copy of any such reports or agency
inspections; (ii) obtain and provide Landlord copies of all necessary permits
required for the

                                    Page 9
<PAGE>

use and handling of Hazardous Materials on the Premises; (iii) enforce Hazardous
Materials handling and disposal practices consistent with industry standards;
(iv) surrender the Premises free from any Hazardous Materials arising from
Tenant's bringing, using, permitting, generating, creating, releasing, emitting
or disposing of Hazardous Materials; and (v) properly close the facility with
regard to Hazardous Materials including the removal or decontamination of any
process piping, mechanical ducting, storage tanks, containers, or trenches which
have come into contact with Hazardous Materials and obtain a closure certificate
from the local administering agency prior to the Expiration Date. Landlord
acknowledges and consents to the storage on the Premises by Tenant of diesel
fuel for Tenant's emergency generators, such storage to be in above-ground tanks
reasonably approved by Landlord.

  B. Tenant's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials:    Tenant shall, at its
sole cost and expense,  comply with all laws pertaining to, and shall with
counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Landlord and Landlord's trustees, shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
partners, affiliates, and agents from, any claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses incurred or suffered arising from the bringing, using, permitting,
generating, emitting or disposing of Hazardous Materials by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents through the surface soils of the Premises during the Lease Term or the
violation of any Governmental Regulation or environmental law, by Tenant or
Tenant's Agents.  Tenant's foregoing indemnification, defense, and hold harmless
obligations include, without limitation, the following:  (i) claims, liability,
costs or expenses resulting from or based upon administrative, judicial (civil
or criminal) or other action, legal or equitable, brought by any private or
public person under common law or under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended ("CERCLA"), the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1980 ("RCRA") or any other federal,
state, county or municipal law, ordinance or regulation now or hereafter in
effect; (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or expenses pertaining to the
identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or removal of Hazardous
Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the provision of an
alternative public drinking water source; (iii) all costs of defending such
claims; (iv) losses attributable to diminution in the value of the Premises or
the Building; (v) loss or restriction of use of rentable space in the Building;
(vi) adverse effect on the marketing of any space in the Building; and (vi) all
other liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, claims, actions (including
remedial or enforcement actions of any kind and administrative or judicial
proceedings, orders or judgments), damages (including consequential and punitive
damages), and costs (including attorney, consultant, and expert fees and
expenses) resulting from the release or violation.  This Section 12.B shall
survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.

  C. Actual Release by Tenant:    Tenant agrees to notify Landlord of any
lawsuits or orders which relate to the remedying of or actual release of
Hazardous Materials on or into the soils or ground water at or under the
Premises.  Tenant shall also provide Landlord all notices required by Section
25359.7(b) of the Health and Safety Code and all other notices required by law
to be given to Landlord in connection with Hazardous Materials.  Without
limiting the foregoing, Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord, within twenty
(20) days after receipt thereof, any written notices from any governmental
agency alleging a material violation of, or material failure to comply with, any
federal, state or local laws, regulations, ordinances or orders, the violation
of which or failure to comply with poses a foreseeable and material risk of
contamination of the ground water or injury to humans (other than injury solely
to Tenant or Tenant's Agents).

     In the event of any release on or into the Premises or into the soil or
ground water under the Premises, the Building or the Project of any Hazardous
Materials used, treated, stored or disposed of by Tenant or Tenant's Agents,
Tenant agrees to comply, at its sole cost, with all laws, regulations,
ordinances and orders of any federal, state or local agency relating to the
monitoring or remediation of such Hazardous Materials.  In the event of any such
release of Hazardous Materials Tenant shall immediately give verbal and follow-
up written notice of the release to Landlord, and Tenant agrees to meet and
confer with Landlord and its Lender to attempt to eliminate and mitigate any
financial exposure to such Lender and resultant exposure to Landlord under
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 736(b) as a result of such release,
and promptly to take reasonable

                                    Page 10
<PAGE>

monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps given, inter alia, the historical uses to
which the Property has and continues to be used, the risks to public health
posed by the release, the then available technology and the costs of
remediation, cleanup and monitoring, consistent with acceptable customary
practices for the type and severity of such contamination and all applicable
laws. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall eliminate, modify or reduce the
obligation of Tenant under 12.B of this Lease to indemnify, defend and hold
Landlord harmless from any claims liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or
suffered by Landlord. Tenant shall provide Landlord prompt written notice of
Tenant's monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps.

  In the absence of an order of any federal, state or local governmental or
quasi-governmental agency relating to the cleanup, remediation or other response
action required by applicable law, any dispute arising between Landlord and
Tenant concerning Tenant's obligation to Landlord under this Section 12.C
concerning the level, method, and manner of cleanup, remediation or response
action required in connection with such a release of Hazardous Materials shall
be resolved by mediation and/or arbitration pursuant to this Lease.

  D. Environmental Monitoring:     Landlord and its agents shall have the right
to inspect, investigate, sample and monitor the Premises including any air,
soil, water, ground water or other sampling or any other testing, digging,
drilling or analysis to determine whether Tenant is complying with the terms of
this Section 12.  If Landlord discovers that Tenant is not in compliance with
the terms of this Section 12, any such costs incurred by Landlord, including
attorneys' and consultants' fees, shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord
within thirty (30) days following Landlord's written demand therefore.

  E. Landlord's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials:    Landlord shall, at
its sole cost and expense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant,
indemnify, defend, and hold Tenant harmless from any claims, liabilities, costs
or expenses incurred or suffered by Tenant related to the release, existence,
removal, investigation, monitoring or remediation of Hazardous Materials which
are present or which come to be present on or beneath the Premises except to the
extent the presence of such Hazardous Materials is caused by Tenant or Tenant's
agents.  Landlord's indemnification and hold harmless obligations include,
without limitation, (i) claims, liability, costs or expenses resulting from or
based upon administrative, judicial (civil or criminal) or other action, legal
or equitable, brought by any private or public person under common law or
CERCLA, RCRA, or any other federal, state, county or municipal law, ordinance or
regulation now or hereinafter in effect, (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses pertaining to the identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or
removal of Hazardous Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the
provision of an alternative public drinking water source, and (iii) all costs of
defending such claims.  In no event shall Landlord be liable for any
consequential damages suffered or incurred by Tenant as a result of any such
contamination.

13.  TENANT'S DEFAULT:    The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute a default and breach of this Lease by Tenant:  (i) Tenant's failure
to pay the Base Monthly Rent including additional rent or any other payment due
under this Lease within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of
written notice from Landlord that such Base Monthly Rent or other payment was
not received when due, (ii) the abandonment of the Premises by Tenant; (iii)
Tenant's failure to observe and perform any other required provision of this
Lease, where such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice
from Landlord; provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such that
it cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-day period, Tenant shall not be
deemed in default if it commences within such period to cure, and thereafter
diligently prosecutes the same to completion; (iv) Tenant's making of any
general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (v) the filing by or against
Tenant of a petition to have Tenant adjudged a bankrupt or of a petition for
reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to bankruptcy (unless, in
the case of a petition filed against Tenant, the same is dismissed within sixty
(60) days after the filing); (vi) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to
take possession of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises
or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to
Tenant within sixty (60) days; or (vii) the attachment, execution or other
judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant's

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>

assets located at the Premises or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where such
seizure is not discharged within sixty (60) days.

  A. Remedies:    In the event of any such default by Tenant, then in addition
to other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, Landlord shall have
the immediate option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder
by giving written notice of such intention to terminate.  In the event Landlord
elects to so terminate this Lease, Landlord may recover from Tenant all the
following:  (i) the worth at time of award of any unpaid rent which had been
earned at the time of such termination; (ii) the worth at time of award of the
amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination
until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss for the same
period that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at
time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the
Lease Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; (iv) any other amount necessary to
compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to
perform its obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of
things would be likely to result therefrom; including the following:  (x)
expenses for repairing, altering or remodeling the Premises for purposes of
reletting, (y) broker's fees, advertising costs or other expenses of reletting
the Premises, and (z) costs of carrying the Premises such as taxes, insurance
premiums, utilities and security precautions; and (v) at Landlord's election,
such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be
permitted by applicable California law.  The term "rent", as used herein, is
defined as the minimum monthly installments of Base Monthly Rent and all other
sums required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, all such other sums
being deemed as additional rent due hereunder.  As used in (i) and (ii) above,
"worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at a rate
equal to the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco plus
five (5%) percent per annum.  As used in (iii) above, "worth at the time of
award" shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one (1%)
percent.

  B. Right to Re-enter:     In the event of any such default by Tenant, Landlord
shall have the right, after terminating this Lease, to re-enter the Premises and
remove all persons and property.  Such property may be removed and stored in a
public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of Tenant, and
disposed of by Landlord in any manner permitted by law.

  C. Abandonment:     If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as
provided in Section 13.A or 13.B above, then the provisions of California Civil
Code Section 1951.4, (Landlord may continue the lease in effect after Tenant's
breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due if Tenant has a right
to sublet and assign, subject only to reasonable limitations) as amended from
time to time, shall apply and Landlord may from time to time, without
terminating this Lease, either recover all rental as it becomes due or relet the
Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms and at such rental or
rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its reasonable
discretion may deem advisable, with the right to make alterations and repairs to
the Premises.  In the event that Landlord elects to so relet, rentals received
by Landlord from such reletting shall be applied in the following order to:  (i)
the payment of any indebtedness other than Base Monthly Rent due hereunder from
Tenant to Landlord; (ii) the payment of any cost of such reletting; (iii) the
payment of the cost of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; and (iv) the
payment of Base Monthly Rent due and unpaid hereunder.  The residual rentals, if
any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Base Monthly
Rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder.  Landlord shall have the
obligation to market the space but shall have no obligation to relet the
Premises following a default if Landlord has other comparable available space
within the Building or Project.  In the event the portion of rentals received
from such reletting which is applied to the payment of rent hereunder during any
month be less than the rent payable during that month by Tenant hereunder, then
Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand.  Such
deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly.  Tenant shall also pay to
Landlord, as soon as ascertained, any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in
such reletting or in making such alterations and repairs not covered by the
rentals received from such reletting.

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>

  D. No Termination:     Landlord's re-entry or taking possession of the
Premises pursuant to 13.B or 13.C shall not be construed as an election to
terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention is given to Tenant
or unless the termination is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any reletting without termination by Landlord because of any
default by Tenant, Landlord may at any time after such reletting elect to
terminate this Lease for any such default.

  E. Non-Waiver:   Landlord may accept Tenant's payments without waiving any
rights under this Lease, including rights under a previously served notice of
default. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than any
installment of rent due shall be deemed as other than payment on account of the
amount due.  If Landlord accepts payments after serving a notice of default,
Landlord may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and
remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Tenant any
further notice or demand.  Furthermore, the Landlord's acceptance of rent from
the Tenant when the Tenant is holding over without express written consent does
not convert Tenant's Tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month to month
tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Lease shall be implied by any
failure of Landlord to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision,
even if that violation continues or is repeated.  Any waiver by Landlord of any
provision of this Lease must be in writing.  Such waiver shall affect only the
provision specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the
writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Landlord
shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof by
Landlord.  No act or conduct of Landlord, including, without limitation, the
acceptance of keys to the Premises, shall constitute acceptance of the surrender
of the Premises by Tenant before the Expiration Date.  Only written notice from
Landlord to Tenant of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance of surrender
of the Premises.  Landlord's consent to or approval of any act by Tenant which
requires Landlord's consent or approvals shall not be deemed to waive or render
unnecessary Landlord's consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Tenant.

  F. Performance by Landlord:    If Tenant fails to perform any obligation
required under this Lease or by law or governmental regulation, Landlord in its
sole discretion may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to Tenant, without
waiving any rights or remedies and without releasing Tenant from its obligations
hereunder, perform such obligation, in which event Tenant shall pay Landlord as
additional rent all sums paid by Landlord in connection with such substitute
performance, including interest at the Agreed Interest Rate (as defined in
Section 19.J) within ten (10) days of Landlord's written notice for such
payment.

  G. Habitual Default:    The provisions of Section 13 notwithstanding, the
Parties agree that if Tenant has been in either monetary default or material
non-monetary default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) in the
performance of any (but not necessarily the same) term or condition of this
Lease for four or more times during any twelve (12) month period during the
Lease Term, then such conduct shall, at the election of the Landlord, represent
a separate event of default which cannot be cured by Tenant.  Tenant
acknowledges that the purpose of this provision is to prevent repetitive
defaults by Tenant, which work a hardship upon Landlord and deprive Landlord of
Tenant's timely performance under this Lease.

14.  LANDLORD'S  LIABILITY:

  A. Limitation on Landlord's Liability:    In the event of Landlord's failure
to perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Lease, Tenant shall
give Landlord written notice of such failure and shall give Landlord thirty (30)
days to cure or commence to cure such failure prior to any claim for breach or
resultant damages, provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such
that it cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-day period, Landlord shall not
be deemed in default if it commences within such period to cure, and thereafter
diligently prosecutes the same to completion.  In addition, upon any such
failure by Landlord, Tenant shall give notice by registered or certified mail to
any person or entity with a security interest in the Premises ("Mortgagee") that
has provided Tenant with notice of its interest in the Premises, and shall
provide Mortgagee a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure, including such
time to obtain possession of the Premises by power of sale or judicial
foreclosure, if such should prove necessary to effectuate a cure.  Tenant agrees
that each of the Mortgagees to whom this Lease

                                    Page 13

has been assigned is an expressed third-party beneficiary hereof. Tenant waives
any right under California Civil Code Section 1950.7 or any other present or
future law to the collection of any payment or deposit from Mortgagee or any
purchaser at a foreclosure sale of Mortgagee's interest unless Mortgagee or such
purchaser shall have actually received and not refunded the applicable payment
or deposit. Tenant further waives any right to terminate this Lease and to
vacate the Premises on Landlord's default under this Lease, except in the event
of a constructive eviction under law. Tenant's sole remedy on Landlord's default
is an action for damages or injunctive or declaratory relief.

  B. Limitation on Tenant's Recourse':    If Landlord is a corporation, trust,
partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association or other form of business
entity, then (i) the obligations of Landlord shall not constitute personal
obligations of the officers, directors, trustees, partners, joint venturers,
members, owners, stockholders, or other principals or representatives except to
the extent of their interest in the Premises.  Tenant shall have recourse only
to the interest of Landlord in the Premises or for the satisfaction of the
obligations of Landlord and shall not have recourse to any other assets of
Landlord for the satisfaction of such obligations.

  C. Indemnification of Landlord:    As a material part of the consideration
rendered to Landlord, Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord for
damages to goods, wares and merchandise, and all other personal property in,
upon or about said Premises and for injuries to persons in or about said
Premises, from any cause arising at any time to the fullest extent permitted by
law, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence
of Landlord, and Tenant shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably
acceptable to Landlord and hold Landlord, and their shareholders, directors,
officers, trustees, employees, partners, affiliates and agents from any claims,
liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or suffered arising from the use of
occupancy of the Premises or any part of the Project by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents, the acts or omissions of Tenant or Tenant's Agents, Tenant's breach of
this Lease, or any damage or injury to person or property from any cause, except
to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence of Landlord
or from the failure of Tenant to keep the Premises in good condition and repair
as herein provided, except to the extent due to the active negligence or willful
misconduct of Landlord.  Further, in the event Landlord is made party to any
litigation due to the acts or omission of Tenant and Tenant's Agents, Tenant
will indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold
Landlord harmless from any such claim or liability including Landlord's costs
and expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in defending such claims.

15.  DESTRUCTION OF PREMISES:

  A. Landlord's Obligation to Restore: In the event of a destruction of the
Premises during the Lease Term Landlord shall repair the same to a similar
condition to that which existed prior to such destruction.  Such destruction
shall not annul or void this Lease; however, Tenant shall be entitled to a
proportionate reduction of Base Monthly Rent while repairs are being made, such
proportionate reduction to be based upon the extent to which the repairs
interfere with Tenant's business in the Premises, as reasonably determined by
Landlord. In no event shall Landlord be required to replace or restore
Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or Tenant's fixtures or personal property.
With respect to a destruction which Landlord is obligated to repair or may elect
to repair under the terms of this Section, Tenant waives the provisions of
Section 1932, and Section 1933, Subdivision 4, of the Civil Code of the State of
California, and any other similarly enacted statute, and the provisions of this
Section 15 shall govern in the case of such destruction.

  B. Limitations on Landlord's Restoration Obligation: Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 15.A, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair, or
restore the Premises if any of the following occur:  (i) if the repairs cannot
be made within two hundred seventy (270) days from the date of receipt of all
governmental approvals necessary under the laws and regulations of State,
Federal, County or Municipal authorities, as reasonably determined by Landlord,
(ii) if the holder of the first deed of trust or mortgage encumbering the
Building elects not to permit the insurance proceeds payable upon damage or
destruction to be used for such repair or restoration, (iii) the damage or
destruction is not fully covered by the insurance (plus any deductible amount)
maintained by Landlord, (iv) the damage or destruction occurs in the last twenty
four (24) months of the Lease

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>

Term, (v) Tenant is in default pursuant to the provisions of Section 13, or (vi)
Tenant has vacated the Premises for more than the immediately preceding one
hundred twenty (120) days. In any such event Landlord may elect either to
complete the repair or restoration, or terminate this Lease by providing Tenant
written notice of its election within sixty (60) days following the damage or
destruction. Tenant shall also have a right to terminate this Lease if the
repairs cannot be made within two hundred seventy (270) days from the date of
receipt of all governmental approvals necessary under the laws and regulations
of State, Federal, County or Municipal authorities, by providing Landlord
written notice of its election within sixty (60) days following the damage or
destruction.

16.  CONDEMNATION:    If any part of the Premises shall be taken for any public
or quasi-public use, under any statute or by right of eminent domain or private
purchase in lieu thereof, and only a part thereof remains which is susceptible
of occupation hereunder as reasonably determined by Tenant, this Lease shall, as
to the part so taken, terminate as of the day before title vests in the
condemnor or purchaser ("Vesting Date") and Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder
shall be adjusted so that Tenant is required to pay for the remainder of the
Lease Term only such portion of Base Monthly Rent as the value of the part
remaining after such taking bears to the value of the entire Premises prior to
such taking.  If all of the Premises or such part thereof be taken so that there
does not remain a portion susceptible for occupation hereunder as reasonably
determined by Tenant, this Lease shall terminate on the Vesting Date.  If part
or all of the Premises be taken, all compensation awarded upon such taking shall
go to Landlord, and Tenant shall have no claim thereto; except Landlord shall
cooperate with Tenant, without cost to Landlord, to recover compensation for
damage to or taking of any Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or for Tenant's
moving costs, loss of or damage to Tenant's personal property, loss to Tenant
because of interruption of business, Tenant's loss of goodwill, and the value
attributable to any leasehold value for the difference between the market value
of the Premises for the remainder or the term above the value, at the date of
taking, of the rent payable for the remainder of the term.  Tenant will have no
right to pursue a claim based upon the residual value of the Land after
expiration of the term or pursue claims or retain any award to which Landlord is
entitled so as inequitably to diminish Landlord's award.  Tenant hereby waives
the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedures Section 1265.130 and any
other similarly enacted statue, and the provisions of this Section 16 shall
govern in the case of a taking.

17.  ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLEASE:

  A. Consent by Landlord:    Except as specifically provided in this Section 17,
Tenant may not assign, sublet, hypothecate, or allow a third party to use the
Premises without the express written consent of Landlord, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  In the event Tenant desires to assign
this Lease or any interest herein or sublet the Premises or any part thereof,
Tenant shall deliver to Landlord (i) executed counterparts of any agreement and
of all ancillary agreements with the proposed assignee/subtenant, (ii) current
financial statements of the transferee covering the preceding three years, (iii)
the nature of the proposed transferee's business to be carried on in the
Premises, (iv) a statement outlining all consideration to be given on account of
the Transfer, and (v) a current financial statement of Tenant.  Landlord may
condition its approval of any Transfer on receipt of a certification from both
Tenant and the proposed transferee of all consideration to be paid to Tenant in
connection with such Transfer.  At Landlord's request, Tenant shall also provide
additional information reasonably required by Landlord to determine whether it
will consent to the proposed assignment or sublease.  Landlord shall have a
eight (8) business-day period following receipt of all the foregoing within
which to notify Tenant in writing that Landlord elects to: (i) terminate this
Lease in the event the proposed sublease or assignment is for substantially all
of space in the Premises (provided, however, that Landlord shall not have the
right to terminate on any sublease or assignment expiring, including any options
in favor of sublessee/assignee, more than three (3) years prior to the Lease
Expiration Date, including any options under this Lease which have been
exercised by Tenant); (ii) permit Tenant to assign or sublet such space to the
named assignee/subtenant on the terms and conditions set forth in the notice; or
(iii) refuse consent.  If Landlord should fail to notify Tenant in writing of
such election within the 30-day period, Landlord shall be deemed to have

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>

elected option (ii) above. In the event Landlord elects option (i) above, this
Lease shall expire with respect to such part of the Premises on the date upon
which the proposed sublease or transfer was to commence, and from such date
forward, Base Monthly Rent and all other costs and charges shall be adjusted
based upon the proportion that the rentable area of the Premises remaining bears
to the total rentable area of the Building. In the event Landlord elects option
(ii) above, Landlord's written consent to the proposed assignment or sublease
shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided and upon the condition that: (i)
the proposed assignee or subtenant is engaged in a business that is limited to
the use expressly permitted under this Lease; (ii) the proposed assignment or
sublease is in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; (iii) the proposed
sublease will not result in there being more than two (2) subtenants within the
Premises at any time during the Lease Term; (iv) Tenant reimburses Landlord on
demand for any reasonable costs that may be incurred by Landlord in connection
with said assignment or sublease, including the costs of making investigations
as to the acceptability of the proposed assignee or subtenant and legal costs
(not to exceed $2,000.00 per occurance) incurred in connection with the granting
of any requested consent; and (v) Tenant shall not have advertised or publicized
in any way the availability of the Premises without prior notice to Landlord. In
the event all or any one of the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, Landlord
shall be considered to have acted reasonably if it withholds its consent.

  B. Assignment or Subletting Consideration:    Landlord and Tenant hereby agree
that fifty percent (50%) of any rent or other economic consideration (not
including any payments for Tenant's furniture or other personal property owned
by Tenant, any payment for utilities or for other office services provided by
Tenant);  (i) realized by Tenant under any sublease or assignment, or (ii)
realized by any subtenant under any sub-sublease of the Premises, in excess of
the Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder after deducting reasonable subletting
and assignment costs directly related to such sublease or assignment including
lease commissions, attorneys fees, costs of demising or otherwise preparing the
sublease space for occupancy, and the unamortized cost of Alterations applicable
to the space so sublet or assigned, shall be paid to Landlord.  Tenant's
obligation to pay over Landlord's portion of the consideration constitutes an
obligation for additional rent hereunder.  The above provisions relating to
Landlord's right to terminate the Lease and relating to the allocation of excess
rent are independently negotiated terms of the Lease which constitute a material
inducement for the Landlord to enter into the Lease, and are agreed by the
Parties to be commercially reasonable.  No assignment or subletting by Tenant
shall relieve it of any obligation under this Lease.  Any assignment or
subletting which conflicts with the provisions hereof shall be void.

  C. No Release:    Any assignment or sublease shall be made only if and shall
not be effective until the assignee or subtenant shall execute, acknowledge, and
deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to
Landlord, whereby the assignee or subtenant shall assume all the applicable
obligations of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed or observed and
shall be subject to all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and
conditions in this Lease.  Notwithstanding any such sublease or assignment and
the acceptance of rent by Landlord from any subtenant or assignee, Tenant and
any guarantor shall remain fully liable for the payment of Base Monthly Rent and
additional rent due, and to become due hereunder, for the performance of all the
covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Lease
on the part of Tenant to be performed and for all acts and omissions of any
licensee, subtenant, assignee or any other person claiming under or through any
subtenant or assignee that shall be in violation of any of the terms and
conditions of this Lease, and any such violation shall be deemed a violation by
Tenant.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and
against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any claims that may be made against
Landlord by the proposed assignee or subtenant (except to the extent caused by
Landlord's gross negligence or willful misconduct) or by any real estate brokers
or other persons claiming compensation in connection with the proposed
assignment or sublease.

  D. Reorganization of Tenant:    The provisions of this Section 17.D shall
apply if Tenant is a corporation and: (i) there is a dissolution, merger,
consolidation, or other reorganization of or affecting Tenant, where

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>

Tenant is not the surviving corporation, or (ii) there is a sale or transfer to
one person or entity (or to any group of related persons or entities) of stock
possessing more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of
Tenant's capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote for the election
of directors, and after such sale or transfer of stock Tenant's stock is no
longer publicly traded. In a transaction under clause (i) the surviving
corporation shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement in form
reasonably satisfactory to Landlord under which such surviving corporation
assumes the obligations of Tenant hereunder, and in a transaction under clause
(ii) the transferee or buyer shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an
agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord under which such
transferee or buyer assumes the obligations of Tenant under the Lease.

  E. Permitted Transfers:    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
17, so long as Tenant otherwise complies with the provisions of this Article,
Tenant may enter into any of the following transfers (a "Permitted Transfer")
without Landlord's prior consent, and Landlord shall not be entitled to
terminate the Lease or to receive any part of any subrent resulting therefrom
that would otherwise be due pursuant to Sections 17.A and 17.B.  Tenant may
sublease all or part of the Premises or assign its interest in this Lease to (i)
any corporation which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with the original Tenant to this Lease by means of an ownership interest of more
than 50%; (ii) a corporation which results from a merger, consolidation or other
reorganization in which Tenant is not the surviving corporation, so long as the
surviving corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is
equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such
transaction; and (iii) a corporation which purchases or otherwise acquires all
or substantially all of the assets of Tenant so long as such acquiring
corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is equal to or
greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such transaction.

  F. Effect of Default:    In the event of Tenant's default, Tenant hereby
assigns all rents due from any assignment or subletting to Landlord as security
for performance of its obligations under this Lease, and Landlord may collect
such rents as Tenant's Attorney-in-Fact, except that Tenant may collect such
rents unless a default occurs as described in Section 13 above.  A termination
of the Lease due to Tenant's default shall not automatically terminate an
assignment or sublease then in existence; rather at Landlord's election, such
assignment or sublease shall survive the Lease termination, the assignee or
subtenant shall attorn to Landlord, and Landlord shall undertake the obligations
of Tenant under the sublease or assignment; except that Landlord shall not be
liable for prepaid rent, security deposits or other defaults of Tenant to the
subtenant or assignee, or for any acts or omissions of Tenant and Tenant's
Agents.

  G. Conveyance by Landlord:    As used in this Lease, the term "Landlord" is
defined only as the owner for the time being of the Premises, so that in the
event of any sale or other conveyance of the Premises or in the event of a
master lease of the Premises, Landlord shall be entirely freed and relieved of
all its covenants and obligations hereunder, and it shall be deemed and
construed, without further agreement between the Parties and the purchaser at
any such sale or the master tenant of the Premises, that the purchaser or master
tenant of the Premises has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants
and obligations of Landlord hereunder.  Such transferor shall transfer and
deliver Tenant's security deposit to the purchaser at any such sale or the
master tenant of the Premises, and thereupon the transferor shall be discharged
from any further liability in reference thereto.

  F. Successors and Assigns:    Subject to the provisions this Section 17, the
covenants and conditions of this Lease shall apply to and bind the heirs,
successors, executors, administrators and assigns of all Parties hereto; and all
Parties hereto comprising Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable
hereunder.

18.  OPTION TO EXTEND THE LEASE TERM:

  A. Grant and Exercise of Option:    Landlord grants to Tenant, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Section 18.A, two (2) options (the
"Options") to extend the Lease Term for an additional term (the "Option Term").
Each Option Term shall be for a period of sixty (60) months and shall be
exercised, if at all, by written notice to Landlord no later than nine (9)
months prior to the date the Lease Term would expire but for such exercise, time
being of

                                    Page 17
<PAGE>

the essence for the giving of such notice. If Tenant exercises the Option, all
of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease except for the grant of
additional Options pursuant to this Section, provided that Base Monthly Rent for
the Premises payable by Tenant during the Option Term shall be the greater of
(i) the Base Monthly Rent applicable to the period immediately prior to the
commencement of the Option Term, and (ii) ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair
Market Rental as hereinafter defined. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if Tenant is in monetary or material non-monetary default under any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease (beyond applicable cure
periods) either at the time Tenant exercises the Option or at any time
thereafter prior to the commencement date of the Option Term, then Landlord
shall have, in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies provided
in this Lease, the right to terminate the Option upon notice to Tenant, in which
event the Lease Term shall not be extended pursuant to this Section 18.A. As
used herein, the term "Fair Market Rental" is defined as the rental and all
other monetary payments, including any escalations and adjustments thereto
(including without limitation Consumer Price Indexing) that Landlord could
obtain during the Option Term from a third party desiring to lease the Premises,
based upon the current use and other potential uses of the Premises, as
determined by the rents then being obtained for new leases of space comparable
in age and quality to the Premises in the same real estate submarket as the
Building. The appraisers shall be instructed that the foregoing five percent
(5%) discount is intended to offset comparable rents that include the following
costs which Landlord will not incur in the event Tenant exercises its option (i)
brokerage commissions, (ii) tenant improvement allowances, (iii) building
improvement costs, and (iv) vacancy costs.

  B. Determination of Fair Market Rental:    If Tenant exercises the Option,
Landlord shall send Tenant notice no later than two hundred forty (240) days
before to the Lease Expiration Date setting forth the Fair Market Rental for the
Option Term.  If Tenant disputes Landlord's determination of Fair Market Rental
for the Option Term, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of
Landlord's notice setting forth Fair Market Rental for the Option Term, send to
Landlord a notice stating that Tenant either elects to terminate its exercise of
the Option, in which event the Option shall lapse and this Lease shall terminate
on the Expiration Date, or that Tenant disagrees with Landlord's determination
of Fair Market Rental for the Option Term and elects to resolve the disagreement
as provided in Section 18.C below. If Tenant does not send Landlord a notice as
provided in the previous sentence, Landlord's determination of Fair Market
Rental shall be the basis for computing the Base Monthly Rent payable by Tenant
during the Option Term.  If Tenant elects to resolve the disagreement as
provided in Section 18.C and such procedures are not concluded prior to the
commencement date of the Option Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Base
Monthly Rent ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as determined
by Landlord in the manner provided above.  If the Fair Market Rental as finally
determined pursuant to Section 18.C is greater than Landlord's determination,
Tenant shall pay Landlord the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and
ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so determined in Section
18.C within thirty (30) days after such determination.  If the Fair Market
Rental as finally determined in Section 18.C is less than Landlord's
determination, the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and ninety five
percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so determined in Section 18.C shall
be credited against the next installments of Base Monthly Rent due from Tenant
to Landlord hereunder.

  C.   Resolution of a Disagreement over the Fair Market Rental:    Any
disagreement regarding Fair Market Rental shall be resolved as follows:

     1.  Within thirty (30) days after Tenant's response to Landlord's notice
setting forth the Fair Market Rental, Landlord and Tenant shall meet at a
mutually agreeable time and place, in an attempt to resolve the disagreement.

     2.  If within the 30-day period referred to above, Landlord and Tenant
cannot reach agreement as to Fair Market Rental, each party shall select one
appraiser to determine Fair Market Rental.  Each such appraiser shall arrive at
a determination of Fair Market Rental and submit their conclusions to Landlord
and Tenant within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the 30-day
consultation period described above.

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>

     3.  If only one appraisal is submitted within the requisite time period, it
shall be deemed as Fair Market Rental.  If both appraisals are submitted within
such time period and the two appraisals so submitted differ by less than ten
percent (10%), the average of the two shall be deemed as Fair Market Rental.  If
the two appraisals differ by more than 10%, the appraisers shall immediately
select a third appraiser who shall, within thirty (30) days after his selection,
make and submit to Landlord and Tenant a determination of Fair Market Rental.
This third appraisal will then be averaged with the closer of the two previous
appraisals and the result shall be Fair Market Rental.

     4.  All appraisers specified pursuant to this Section shall be members of
the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers with not less than ten (10)
years experience appraising office and industrial properties in the Santa Clara
Valley.  Each party shall pay the cost of the appraiser selected by such party
and one-half of the cost of the third appraiser.

  D. Personal to Tenant:    All Options provided to Tenant in this Lease are
personal and granted to VeriSign, Inc. (and any permitted transferee pursuant to
Section 17.E. above) and are not exercisable by any third party should Tenant
assign or sublet all or a portion of its rights under this Lease, unless
Landlord consents to permit exercise of any option by any assignee or subtenant,
in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion.  In the event Tenant has multiple
options to extend this Lease, a later option to extend the Lease cannot be
exercised unless the prior option has been properly exercised.

19.  GENERAL PROVISIONS:

  A. Attorney's Fees:    In the event a suit or alternative form of dispute
resolution is brought for the possession of the Premises, for the recovery of
any sum due hereunder, to interpret the Lease, or because of the breach of any
other covenant herein; then the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party
reasonable attorney's fees including the expense of expert witnesses,
depositions and court testimony as part of its costs which shall be deemed to
have accrued on the commencement of such action.  The prevailing party shall
also be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including reasonable
attorney's fees incurred in enforcing any judgment or award against the other
party.  The foregoing provision relating to post-judgment costs is severable
from all other provisions of this Lease.

  B. Authority of Parties:   Tenant represents and warrants that it is duly
formed and in good standing, and is duly authorized to execute and deliver this
Lease on behalf of said corporation, in accordance with a duly adopted
resolution of the Board of Directors of said corporation or in accordance with
the by-laws of said corporation, and that this Lease is binding upon said
corporation in accordance with its terms.  At Landlord's request, Tenant shall
provide Landlord with corporate resolutions or other proof in a form acceptable
to Landlord, authorizing the execution of the Lease.

  C. Brokers:    Tenant represents it has not utilized or contacted a real
estate broker or finder with respect to this Lease other than Cornish & Carey
Commercial and Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless
against any claim, cost, liability or cause of action asserted by any other
broker or finder claiming through Tenant.

  D. Choice of Law:    This Lease shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with California law.   Except as provided in Section 19.E, venue
shall be Santa Clara County.

  E. Dispute Resolution: Landlord and Tenant and any other party that may become
a party to this Lease or be deemed a party to this Lease including any
subtenants agree that, except for any claim by Landlord for unlawful detainer or
any claim within the jurisdiction of the small claims court (which small claims
court shall be the sole court of competent jurisdiction), any controversy,
dispute, or claim of whatever nature arising out of, in connection with or in
relation to the interpretation, performance or breach of this Lease, including
any claim based on contract, tort, or statute, shall be resolved at the request
of any party to this agreement through a two-step dispute resolution process
administered by J.A.M.S. or another judicial mediation service mutually
acceptable to the parties located in Santa Clara County, California. The dispute
resolution process shall involve first, mediation, followed, if necessary, by
final and binding arbitration administered by and in accordance with the then
existing rules and practices of J.A.M.S. or other judicial mediation service
selected. In the event of any

                                    Page 19
<PAGE>

dispute subject to this provision, either party may initiate a request for
mediation and the parties shall use reasonable efforts to promptly select a
J.A.M.S. mediator and commence the mediation. In the event the parties are not
able to agree on a mediator within thirty (30) days, J. A. M. S. or another
judicial mediation service mutually acceptable to the parties shall appoint a
mediator. The mediation shall be confidential and in accordance with California
Evidence Code (S) 1119 et. seq. The mediation shall be held in Santa Clara
County, California and in accordance with the existing rules and practice of
J.A.M.S. (or other judicial and mediation service selected). The parties shall
use reasonable efforts to conclude the mediation within sixty (60) days of the
date of either party's request for mediation. The mediation shall be held prior
to any arbitration or court action (other than a claim by Landlord for unlawful
detainer or any claim within the jurisdiction of the small claims court which
are not subject to this mediation/arbitration provision and may be filed
directly with a court of competent jurisdiction). Should the prevailing party in
any dispute subject to this Section 19.E attempt an arbitration or a court
action before attempting to mediate, the prevailing party shall not be entitled
to attorney's fees that might otherwise be available to them in a court action
or arbitration and in addition thereto, the party who is determined by the
arbitrator to have resisted mediation, shall be sanctioned by the arbitrator or
judge.

IF A MEDIATION IS CONDUCTED BUT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, IT SHALL BE FOLLOWED BY FINAL
AND BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEN EXISTING
RULES AND PRACTICES OF J.A.M.S. OR THE OTHER JUDICIAL AND MEDIATION SERVICE
SELECTED, AND JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY BE
ENTERED BY ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF AS PROVIDED BY
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1280 ET. SEQ, AS SAID STATUTES THEN
APPEAR, INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS TO SAID STATUTES OR SUCCESSORS TO SAID STATUTES
OR AMENDED STATUTES, EXCEPT THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PARTIES BE ENTITLED TO
PROPOUND INTERROGATORIES OR REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS DURING THE ARBITRATION
PROCESS. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE A RETIRED JUDGE OR A LICENSED CALIFORNIA
ATTORNEY. THE VENUE FOR ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR MEDIATION SHALL BE IN SANTA

security regulations, Tenant shall permit Landlord and his agents to
enter into and upon the Premises at all reasonable times, and without any rent
abatement or reduction or any liability to Tenant for any reasonable loss of
occupation or quiet enjoyment of the Premises thereby occasioned, for the
following purposes:  (i) inspecting and maintaining the Premises; (ii) making

building(s) and improvements on the land where the Premises are situated or on
adjacent land owned by Landlord; (iv) performing any obligations of Landlord
under the Lease including remediation of Hazardous Materials if determined to be
the responsibility of Landlord, (v) posting and keeping posted thereon notices
of non-responsibility for any construction, alteration or repair thereof, as
required or permitted by any law, and (vi) showing the Premises to Landlord's or
the Master Landlord's existing or potential successors, purchaser, tenants and
lenders.  Tenant shall permit Landlord and his agents, at any time within one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Expiration Date (or at any time during
the Lease if Tenant is in default hereunder), to place upon the Premises "For
Lease" signs and exhibit the Premises to real estate brokers and prospective
tenants at reasonable hours.

  H. Estoppel Certificates:    At any time during the Lease Term, each party
(the "Responding Party") shall, within ten (10) business days following written
notice from the other party (the "Requesting Party"), execute and deliver to the
Requesting Party a written statement certifying, if true, the following:  (i)
that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified,
stating the nature of such modification); (ii) the date to which rent and other
charges are paid in advance, if any; (iii) acknowledging that there are not, to
Responding Party's knowledge, any uncured defaults on Requesting Party's part
hereunder (or specifying such defaults if they are claimed); and (iv) such other
information as Requesting Party may reasonably request.  Any such statement may
be conclusively relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of
Requesting Party's interest in the Premises.  The Responding Party's failure to
deliver such statement within such time shall be conclusive upon the Responding
Party that this Lease is in full force and effect without modification, except
as may be represented by the Requesting Party, and that there are no uncured
defaults in Requesting Party's performance.  Tenant agrees to provide, within
five (5) days of Landlord's request, Tenant's most recent three (3) years of
audited financial statements for Landlord's use in financing or sale of the
Premises or Landlord's interest therein.

  I. Exhibits:    All exhibits referred to are attached to this Lease and
incorporated by reference.

  J. Interest:    All rent due hereunder, if not paid when due, shall bear
interest at the rate of the Reference Rate published by Bank of America, San
Francisco Branch, plus two percent (2%) per annum from that date until paid in
full ("Agreed Interest Rate").  This provision shall survive the expiration or
sooner termination of the Lease.  Despite any other provision of this Lease, the
total liability for interest payments shall not exceed the limits, if any,
imposed by the usury laws of the State of California.  Any interest paid in
excess of those limits shall be refunded to Tenant by application of the amount
of excess interest paid against any sums outstanding in any order that Landlord
requires.  If the amount of excess interest paid exceeds the sums outstanding,
the portion exceeding those sums shall be refunded in cash to Tenant by
Landlord.  To ascertain whether any interest payable exceeds the limits imposed,
any non-principal payment (including late charges) shall be considered to the
extent permitted by law to be an expense or a fee, premium, or penalty rather
than interest.

  K. This section intentionally left blank.

  L. No Presumption Against Drafter:    Landlord and Tenant understand, agree
and acknowledge that this Lease has been freely negotiated by both Parties; and
that in any controversy, dispute, or contest over the meaning, interpretation,
validity, or enforceability of this Lease or any of its terms or conditions,
there shall be no inference, presumption, or conclusion drawn whatsoever against
either party by virtue of that party having drafted this Lease or any portion
thereof.

  M. Notices:    All notices, demands, requests, or consents required to be
given under this Lease shall be sent in writing by U.S. certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal delivery addressed to the party to be notified
at the address for such party specified in Section 1 of this Lease, or to such
other place

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>

as the party to be notified may from time to time designate by at least fifteen
(15) days prior notice to the notifying party. When this Lease requires service
of a notice, that notice shall satisfy rather than supplement any similar
statutorily required notice, including any notice required by Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1161 or any similar or successor statute. When a statute
requires service of a notice in a particular manner, service of such notice in
the manner described in the first sentence of this Section 19.M. shall satisfy
such statutory requirement.

  N. Property Management:    In addition, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord along
with the expenses to be reimbursed by Tenant a monthly fee for management
services rendered by either Landlord or a third party manager engaged by
Landlord (which may be a party affiliated with Landlord), in the amount of three
percent (3%) of the Base Monthly Rent.

  O. Rent:    All monetary sums due from Tenant to Landlord under this Lease,
including, without limitation those referred to as "additional rent", shall be
deemed as rent.

  P. Representations:    Tenant acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any of
its employees or agents have made any agreements, representations, warranties or
promises with respect to the Premises or with respect to present or future
rents, expenses, operations, tenancies or any other matter.  Except as herein
expressly set forth herein, Tenant relied on no statement of Landlord or its
employees or agents for that purpose.

  Q. Rights and Remedies:    Subject to Section 14 above, All rights and
remedies hereunder are cumulative and not alternative to the extent permitted by
law, and are in addition to all other rights and remedies in law and in equity.

  R. Severability:    If any term or provision of this Lease is held
unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
the Lease shall not be invalidated thereby but shall be enforceable in
accordance with its terms, omitting the invalid or unenforceable term.

  S. Submission of Lease:    Submission of this document for examination or
signature by the parties does not constitute an option or offer to lease the
Premises on the terms in this document or a reservation of the Premises in favor
of Tenant.  This document is not effective as a lease or otherwise until
executed and delivered by both Landlord and Tenant.

  T. Subordination:    This Lease is subject and subordinate to ground and
underlying leases, mortgages and deeds of trust (collectively "Encumbrances")
which may now affect the Premises, to any covenants, conditions or restrictions
of record, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and
extensions thereof; provided, however, if the holder or holders of any such
Encumbrance ("Holder") require that this Lease be prior and superior thereto,
within seven (7) days after written request of Landlord to Tenant, Tenant shall
execute, have acknowledged and deliver all documents or instruments, in the
commercially reasonable form presented to Tenant, which Landlord or Holder deems
necessary or desirable for such purposes.  Landlord shall have the right to
cause this Lease to be and become and remain subject and subordinate to any and
all Encumbrances which are now or may hereafter be executed covering the
Premises or any renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements or
extensions thereof, for the full amount of all advances made or to be made
thereunder and without regard to the time or character of such advances,
together with interest thereon and subject to all the terms and provisions
thereof; provided only, that in the event of termination of any such lease or
upon the foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed of trust, Holder agrees to
recognize Tenant's rights under this Lease as long as Tenant is not in default
either at the time Holder recognizes such rights or at any time thereafter.
Within ten (10) business days after Landlord's written request, Tenant shall
execute any documents in commercially reasonable form required by Landlord or
the Holder to make this Lease subordinate to any lien of the Encumbrance,
provided that within those documents the Tenant's rights under this Lease are
recognized only as long as Tenant is not in default.  If Tenant fails to do so,
then in addition to such failure constituting a default by Tenant, it shall be
deemed that this Lease is so subordinated to such Encumbrance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section, Tenant hereby attorns and agrees to
attorn to any entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Premises at any sale
or other proceeding or pursuant to the exercise of any other rights, powers or
remedies under such encumbrance.

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>

Landlord shall cause the existing lender to furnish to Tenant, within sixty (60)
days of the date of both parties' execution of this Lease, with a written
agreement providing for (i) recognition by the lender of all of the terms and
conditions of this Lease; and (ii) continuation of this Lease upon foreclosure
of existing lender's security interest in the Premises.  In the event that
Landlord is unable to provide such agreement, Tenant's sole remedy shall be
termination of the Lease, which election shall be made within fourteen (14) days
following the expiration of such sixty (60) day period.

  U. Survival of Indemnities:  All indemnification, defense, and hold harmless
obligations of Landlord and Tenant under this Lease shall survive the expiration
or sooner termination of the Lease.

  V. Time:    Time is of the essence hereunder.

  W. Transportation Demand Management Programs:  Should a government agency or
municipality require Landlord to institute TDM (Transportation Demand
Management) facilities and/or programs, Tenant agrees that the cost of TDM
imposed facilities and programs required on the Premises, including but not
limited to employee showers, lockers, cafeteria, or lunchroom facilities, shall
be paid by Tenant.  Further, any ongoing costs or expenses associated with a TDM
program which are required for the Premises and not provided by Tenant, such as
an on-site TDM coordinator, shall be provided by Landlord with such costs being
included as additional rent and reimbursed to Landlord by Tenant within thirty
(30) days after demand. If TDM facilities and programs are instituted on a
Project wide basis, Tenant shall pay its proportionate share of such costs in
accordance with Section 8 above.

  X. Waiver of Right to Jury Trial:    Landlord and Tenant waive their
respective rights to trial by jury of any contract or tort claim, counterclaim,
cross-complaint, or cause of action in any action, proceeding, or hearing
brought by either party against the other on any matter arising out of or in any
way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, or
Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, including any claim of injury or
damage or the enforcement of any remedy under any current or future law,
statute, regulation, code, or ordinance.

  Y. Recordation:    A short form Memorandum of Lease, in form and content
reasonably acceptable to the parties, will be executed in recordable form by
each party following execution of this Lease, delivered to Tenant, and may be
recorded by Tenant at its expense.

20.  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER TO PURCHASE:

     A.  Grant and Exercise of Option:    In the event Landlord elects to sell
the Building either separately or as part of a larger sale including other
building(s) within the Project ("Offered Property"), Landlord (referred to
hereinafter in this Section 20 as "Seller") hereby grants Tenant a right of
first offering to purchase.  Prior to Seller committing to sell its interest in
the Offered Property to a third party, Seller shall give Tenant written notice
of such desire and the terms and other information under which Seller intends to
sell the Offered Property.  Provided at the time of such written notice:  (i)
Tenant leases at least two buildings within the Project; and (ii) Tenant is not
in default under the Lease beyond the expiration of any applicable cure period,
Tenant shall have the option, which must be exercised, if at all, by written
notice to Seller within fifteen (15) days after Tenant's receipt of Seller's
notice, to purchase Seller's interest in the Offered Property at the sales price
and terms of sale specified in the notice.  In the event Tenant timely exercises
such option to purchase its interest in the Offered Property, Seller shall sell
its interest in the Offered Property to Tenant, and Tenant shall purchase its
interest in the Offered Property from Seller in accordance with the price and
terms specified in Seller's notice.  Seller and Tenant shall, in good faith,
attempt to reach agreement on the terms of a mutually acceptable purchase
agreement consistent with the terms set forth in Seller's notice within thirty
(30) days of Tenant's exercise of its option to purchase.  In the event either:
(i) Tenant fails to exercise Tenant's option within said 15-day period; or (ii)
after Tenant's exercise, Seller and Tenant are unable to reach agreement on a
mutually acceptable purchase agreement within the subsequent 30-day period;
Seller shall have one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter to sell its interest
in the Offered Property at no less than ninety percent (90%) of the sales price
and upon substantially the same other terms of sale as specified in the notice
to Tenant.  In the event

                                    Page 23
<PAGE>

Seller fails to sell its interest in the Offered Property within said one
hundred eighty (180) day period or in the event Seller proposes to sell its
interest in the Offered Property at less than ninety percent (90%) of the sales
price or on other material terms which are more favorable to the prospective
buyer than that proposed to Tenant, Seller shall be required to resubmit such
offer to Tenant in accordance with this Right of First Offering except that
Tenant shall be required to respond to any resubmission within a seven (7) day
period.

     B.  Exclusions:    This Right of First Offering shall automatically
terminate (i) upon the expiration or sooner termination of the Lease, or (ii) in
the event of a foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of Landlord's interest
in the Building.  Further, this Right of First Offering shall not apply to
transfers (but shall survive such transfers) of all or a portion of the Building
or Project to (i) John A. Sobrato and/or John M. Sobrato (individually and
collectively "Sobrato"), (ii) any immediate family member of Sobrato, (iii) any
trust established, in whole or in part, for the benefit of Sobrato and/or any
immediate family member of Sobrato, (iv) any partnership in which Sobrato or any
immediate family member, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a
partnership or corporate entity or a trust) retains a general partner interest,
and/or (v) any corporation under the control, either directly or indirectly, by
Sobrato or any immediate family member of Sobrato.

effect sixty (60) days following such notice:  (i) Lease Exhibit "A" shall be
                                                         -----------
superceded by the attached Exhibit "A-1" and all references in the Lease to
                           -------------

feet and all improvements therein, shown as Building 4 on Exhibit "A-1",
                                                          -------------

     B.  Uses Prohibited:   Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed on
the Premises any waste, nuisance, or other act or thing which may disturb the

conditions, restrictions, easements, mortgages or deeds of trust, ground leases,
rights of way of record and any other matters or documents of record; and (ii)

4.   TERM AND RENTAL:

     A.  Base Monthly Rent:   The term ("Lease Term") shall be for one hundred
thirty two (132) months, commencing November 1, 2000 ("Commencement Date"), and
ending October 31, 2011 ("Expiration Date").  Notwithstanding the parties'
agreement that the Lease Term begins on the Commencement Date, this Lease and
all of the obligations of Landlord and Tenant shall be binding and in full force
and effect from and after the Effective Date.  In addition to all other sums
payable by Tenant under this Lease, Tenant shall pay base monthly rent ("Base
Monthly Rent") for the Premises according to the following schedule:

Building 2:

Months 01-12:    $370,215.00 per month
Months 13-24:    $385,024.00 per month
Months 25-36:    $400,425.00 per month
Months 37-48:    $416,442.00 per month
Months 49-60:    $433,099.00 per month
Months 61-72:    $450,423.00 per month

Building 3:

Months 01-12:    $370,215.00 per month
Months 13-24:    $385,024.00 per month
Months 25-36:    $400,425.00 per month
Months 37-48:    $416,442.00 per month
Months 49-60:    $433,099.00 per month
Months 61-72:    $450,423.00 per month
Months 73-84:    $468,440.00 per month
Months 85-96:    $487,178.00 per month
Months 97-108:   $506,665.00 per month
Months 109-120:  $526,931.00 per month
Months 121-132:  $548,009.00 per month

Base Monthly Rent shall be due in advance on or before the first day of each
calendar month during the Lease Term.  All sums payable by Tenant under this
Lease shall be paid to Landlord in lawful money of the United States of America,
without offset or deduction and without prior notice or demand, at the address
specified in Section 1 of this Lease or at such place or places as may be
designated in writing by Landlord during the Lease Term.  Base Monthly Rent for
any period less than a calendar month shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly
installment.  Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord the sum of $243,750.00 as prepaid rent for the first month of
the Lease.

     B. Late Charges:   Tenant hereby acknowledges that late payment by Tenant
to Landlord of Base Monthly Rent and other sums due hereunder will cause
Landlord to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of
which is extremely difficult to ascertain. Such costs include but are not
limited to: administrative, processing, accounting, and late charges which may
be imposed on Landlord by the terms of any contract, revolving credit, mortgage,
or trust deed covering the Premises. Accordingly, if any installment of Base
Monthly Rent or other sum due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or
its designee within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of written
notice from Landlord that such installment or sum was not received when due,
Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late charge equal to five (5%) percent of such
overdue amount, which late charge shall be due and payable on the same date that
the overdue amount was due. The parties agree that such late charge represents a
fair and reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late
payment by Tenant, excluding interest and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
If any rent or other sum due from Tenant remains delinquent for a period in
excess of thirty (30) days then, in addition to such late charge, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord interest on any rent that is not paid when due at the Agreed
Interest Rate specified in Section 19.J following the date such amount became
due until paid. Acceptance by Landlord of such late charge shall not constitute
a waiver of Tenant's default with respect to such overdue amount nor prevent
Landlord from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.
In the event that a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected,
for four (4) consecutive installments of Base Monthly Rent,

                                    Page 3
<PAGE>

then the Base Monthly Rent shall automatically become due and payable quarterly
in advance, rather than monthly, notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to
the contrary.

     C. Security Deposit:   Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease,
Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of Seven Hundred Forty Thousand Four
Hundred Thirty and No/100 Dollars ($740,430.00) ("Security "Deposit"). Landlord
shall not be deemed a trustee of the Security Deposit, may use the Security
Deposit in business, and shall not be required to segregate it from its general
accounts. Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on the Security Deposit.  If
Tenant defaults with respect to any provisions of the Lease, including but not
limited to the provisions relating to payment of Base Monthly Rent or other
charges, Landlord may, to the extent reasonably necessary to remedy Tenant's
default, use any or all of the Security Deposit towards payment of the
following:  (i) Base Monthly Rent or other charges in default; (ii) any other
amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by reason of
Tenant's default including, but not limited to Tenant's failure to restore or
clean the Premises following vacation thereof.  If any portion of the Security
Deposit is so used or applied, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after written
demand from Landlord, deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient to
restore the Security Deposit to its full original amount, and shall pay to
Landlord such other sums as necessary to reimburse Landlord for any sums paid by
Landlord.  If Tenant shall be in either monetary default or material non-
monetary default more than four (4) times in any twelve (12) month period, then
the Security Deposit shall, within ten (10) days after demand by Landlord, be
increased by Tenant to an amount equal to three (3) times the Base Monthly Rent.
Tenant may not assign or encumber the Security Deposit without the consent of
Landlord.  Any attempt to do so shall be void and shall not be binding on
Landlord.  The Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant within thirty (30)
days after the Expiration Date and surrender of the Premises to Landlord, less
any amount deducted in accordance with this Section, together with Landlord's
written notice itemizing the amounts and purposes for such deduction.  In the
event of termination of Landlord's interest in this Lease, Landlord may deliver
or credit the Security Deposit to Landlord's successor in interest in the
Premises and thereupon be relieved of further responsibility with respect to the
Security Deposit.

Landlord agrees that in lieu of a cash Security Deposit, Tenant may deposit a
letter of credit ("Letter of Credit") substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit "B".  Landlord shall be entitled to draw against the Letter of Credit
   -----------
at any time provided only that Landlord certifies to the issuer of the Letter of
Credit that Tenant is in default under the Lease.  Tenant shall keep the letter
of credit in effect during the entire Lease Term, as the same may be extended,
plus a period of four (4) weeks after expiration of the Lease Term.  At least
thirty (30) days prior to expiration of any Letter of Credit, the term thereof
shall be renewed or extended for a period of at least one (1) year.  Tenant's
failure to so renew or extend the Letter of Credit shall be a material default
of this Lease by Tenant.  In the event Landlord draws against the Letter of
Credit, Tenant shall replenish the existing Letter of Credit or cause a new
Letter of Credit to be issued such that the aggregate amount of letters of
credit available to Landlord at all times during the Lease Term is the amount of
the Security Deposit originally required.

5.   CONSTRUCTION:

     A.  Landlord's Obligations:   Except as specifically provided in this
paragraph, prior to Commencement Date Landlord shall ensure that the existing
Buildings and Building systems are in good operating condition and repair
including the foundation, structural components, exterior walls, plumbing, HVAC,
sprinklers, electrical (including panels and outlets), doors (both shipping and
personnel), roof structure and membrane, exterior landscaping, irrigation and
lighting, and parking lot.  "Good operating condition and repair" as used in
this paragraph means that all of the foregoing systems for which Landlord is
responsible shall be fully operational and functional for use for the purposes
for which such systems were intended, and there is no deferred maintenance
required.  Without limitation of the foregoing:  (i) the roof membrane shall be
inspected by a reputable and licensed roofing contractor or roofing inspector
and repaired as necessary to put into good operating condition and repair based
on

                                    Page 4
<PAGE>

such inspection; (ii) the HVAC system shall be inspected by a reputable and
licensed HVAC contractor and repaired as necessary to put into good operating
condition and repair based on such inspection, as evidenced by a report by such
contractor; (iii) all windows shall be washed inside and out, and there shall be
no cracked or broken windows; (iv) all burned out, discolored or broken
lightbulbs, ballasts and lenses shall be replaced; and (v) the parking lot shall
be re-sealed and striped by a reputable and licensed asphalt contractor
provided, however, that Landlord shall have sixty days from the Commencement
Date to complete the parking lot re-sealing and striping.

6.   ACCEPTANCE OF POSSESSION AND COVENANTS TO SURRENDER:

     A.  Delivery and Acceptance:   On the Commencement Date, Landlord shall
deliver and Tenant shall accept possession of the Premises.  Tenant acknowledges
that it has had an opportunity to conduct, and has conducted, such inspections
of the Premises as it deems necessary to evaluate its condition.  Except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, Tenant agrees to accept possession of
the Premises in its then existing condition, subject to all Restrictions and
without representation or warranty by Landlord.

     B.  Early Access:   Tenant shall be allowed early access and occupancy of
the Premises from September 1, 2000 until the Commencement Date ("Early Access
Period") for the purpose of constructing Tenant Improvements and otherwise
preparing for its occupancy. Tenant shall be subject to all the terms and
conditions of the Lease during the Early Access Period except that no Base
Monthly Rent or other expenses shall be due or payable.

     C.  Condition Upon Surrender:   Tenant further agrees on the Expiration
Date or on the sooner termination of this Lease, to surrender the Premises to
Landlord in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted. In this
regard, "normal wear and tear" shall be construed to mean wear and tear caused
to the Premises by the natural aging process which occurs in spite of prudent
application of the best standards for maintenance, repair replacement, and
janitorial practices, and does not include items of neglected or deferred
maintenance.  In any event, Tenant shall cause the following to be done prior to
the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease: (i) all interior walls
shall be painted or cleaned so that they appear freshly painted, (ii) all tiled
floors shall be cleaned and waxed, (iii) all carpets shall be cleaned and
shampooed, (iv) all broken, marred, stained or nonconforming acoustical ceiling
tiles shall be replaced, (v) all cabling placed above the ceiling by Tenant or
Tenant's contractors shall be removed unless such cabling has been placed in
trays especially designed for such purpose and is not weighing directly on the
ceiling, (vi) all windows shall be washed; (vii) the HVAC system shall be
serviced by a reputable and licensed service firm and left in "good operating
condition and repair" as evidenced by a report by such firm, (viii) the plumbing
and electrical systems and lighting shall be placed in good order and repair
(including replacement of any burned out, discolored or broken light bulbs,
ballasts, or lenses. On or before the Expiration Date or sooner termination of
this Lease, Tenant shall remove all its personal property and trade fixtures
from the Premises.  All property and fixtures not so removed shall be deemed as
abandoned by Tenant.  At the expiration of the Lease Term, Landlord shall not
have the right to require that Tenant remove from the Premises any Alterations
(as defined in Section 7 below) made with Landlord's consent unless Landlord, at
the time of granting such consent, indicates that the subject Alteration must be
removed upon the expiration of the Lease Term.  With respect to Permitted
Alterations as defined in Section 7A. below, Tenant shall ascertain from
Landlord within ninety (90) days before the Expiration Date whether Landlord
desires to have such Permitted Alterations removed.  If Landlord so elects,
Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove such Alterations as Landlord
has required and shall repair and restore the affected areas of the Premises
prior to the Expiration Date to a standard open office plan with materials and
finishes consistent with the other open office areas within the Premises.  Such
repair and restoration shall include causing the Premises to be brought into
compliance with all applicable building codes and laws in effect at the time of
the removal to the extent such compliance is necessitated by the repair and
restoration work.

     D.  Failure to Surrender:   If the Premises are not surrendered at the
Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease in the condition required by
this Section 6, Tenant shall be deemed in a holdover tenancy pursuant to this
Section 6.D. and Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold Landlord harmless
against loss or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the
Premises including, without

                                    Page 5
<PAGE>

limitation, any claims made by any succeeding tenant founded on such delay and
costs incurred by Landlord in returning the Premises to the required condition,
plus interest at the Agreed Interest Rate. Any holding over after the
termination or Expiration Date with Landlord's express written consent, shall be
construed as month-to-month tenancy, terminable on thirty (30) days written
notice from either party, and Tenant shall pay as Base Monthly Rent to Landlord
a rate equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the Base Monthly Rent
due in the month preceding the termination or Expiration Date, plus all other
amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease. Any holding over shall otherwise be
on the terms and conditions herein specified, except those provisions relating
to the Lease Term and any options to extend or renew, which provisions shall be
of no further force and effect following the expiration of the applicable
exercise period. If Tenant remains in possession of the Premises after the
Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease without Landlord's consent,
Tenant's continued possession shall be on the basis of a tenancy at sufferance
and Tenant shall pay as rent during the holdover period an amount equal to one
hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Monthly Rent due in the month preceding
the termination or Expiration Date, plus all other amounts payable by Tenant
under this Lease. This provision shall survive the termination or expiration of
the Lease.

7.   ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS:

     A.  Tenant's Alterations':   Tenant shall not make, or suffer to be made,
any alteration or addition to the Premises ("Alterations"), or any part thereof,
without obtaining Landlord's prior written consent and delivering to Landlord
the proposed architectural and structural plans for all such Alterations at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the start of construction. If such Alterations
affect the structure of the Buildings, Tenant additionally agrees to reimburse
Landlord its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in reviewing Tenant's
plans. After obtaining Landlord's consent, which consent shall state whether or
not Landlord will require Tenant to remove such Alteration at the expiration or
earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall not proceed to make such
Alterations until Tenant has obtained all required governmental approvals and
permits. Tenant agrees to provide Landlord (i) written notice of the
anticipated and actual start-date of the work, (ii) a complete set of half-size
(15" X 21") vellum as-built drawings, and (iii) a certificate of occupancy for
the work upon completion of the Alterations.  All Alterations shall be
constructed in compliance with all applicable building codes and laws including,
without limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended from
time to time.  Upon the Expiration Date, all Alterations, except movable
furniture and trade fixtures, shall become a part of the realty and belong to
Landlord but shall nevertheless be subject to removal by Tenant as provided in
Section 6 above.  Alterations which are not deemed as trade fixtures include
heating, lighting, electrical systems, air conditioning, walls, carpeting, or
any other installation which has become an integral part of the Premises
(excepting backup power generators or a UPS system, which Tenant shall have the
right to remove).  All Alterations shall be maintained, replaced or repaired by
Tenant at its sole cost and expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled, without obtaining
Landlord's consent, to make Alterations which do not affect the structure of the
Buildings and which do not cost more than Seventy Thousand Dollars ($70,000.00)
per Alteration ("Permitted Alterations"); provided, however, that:  (i) Tenant
shall still be required to comply with all other provisions of this paragraph;
and (ii) such Permitted Alterations are subject to removal by Tenant at
Landlord's election pursuant to Section 6.C. above at the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease.

     B.  Free From Liens:   Tenant shall keep the Premises free from all liens
arising out of work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by
Tenant or claimed to have been performed for Tenant.  In the event Tenant fails
to discharge any such lien within sixty (60) days after receiving notice of the
filing, Landlord shall be entitled to discharge the lien at Tenant's expense and
all resulting costs incurred by Landlord, including attorney's fees shall be due
from Tenant as additional rent.

     C.  Compliance With Governmental Regulations: The term Laws or Governmental
Regulations shall include all federal, state, county, city or governmental
agency laws, statutes, ordinances, standards, rules, requirements, or orders now
in force or hereafter enacted, promulgated, or issued.  The term also includes
government measures

                                    Page 6
<PAGE>

regulating or enforcing public access, traffic mitigation, occupational, health,
or safety standards for employers, employees, landlords, or tenants. Tenant, at
Tenant's sole expense shall make all repairs, replacements, alterations, or
improvements needed to comply with all Governmental Regulations. The judgment of
any court of competent jurisdiction or the admission of Tenant in any action or
proceeding against Tenant (whether Landlord be a party thereto or not) that
Tenant has violated any such law, regulation or other requirement in its use of
the Premises shall be conclusive of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant.

The foregoing notwithstanding, if any repair, replacement, alteration or
improvement is required to the Buildings foundation, exterior load bearing
walls, roof structure or any other structural component of the Buildings
(excluding structural components installed by Tenant) as a result of any
Governmental Regulations and such required work is not caused by Tenant's
specific use or Alterations, the cost of such repair, replacement, alteration or
improvement shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant such that Tenant
shall pay to Landlord upon completion of such work, the portion of the cost
equal to the product of such cost multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of years remaining in the Lease Term, the denominator of
which is the useful life (in years) of the repair, replacement, alteration or
addition; provided, however, that if the Tenant thereafter exercises a renewal
option, then upon Tenant's exercise of the renewal option, the numerator of the
fraction shall be adjusted to the sum of:  (i) the Lease Term remaining at the
time the repair, replacement, alteration or addition was made; and (ii) the
number of years in the Option Term; and Landlord's reimbursement obligation
shall immediately thereafter be re-calculated.

8.   Maintenance of Premises:

     A.  Landlord's Obligations:   Landlord at its sole cost and expense, shall
maintain in good condition, order, and repair, and replace as and when
necessary, the foundation, exterior load bearing walls and roof structure, and
all other structural components of the Buildings, excluding any components
installed by Tenant.

     B.  Tenant's Obligations:   Tenant shall clean maintain, repair and
replace when necessary the Premises and every part thereof through regular
inspections and servicing, including but not limited to: (i) all plumbing and
sewage facilities, (ii) all heating ventilating and air conditioning facilities
and equipment, (iii) all fixtures, interior walls floors, carpets and ceilings,
(iv) all windows, door entrances, plate glass and glazing systems including
caulking, and skylights, (v) all electrical facilities and equipment, (vi) all
automatic fire extinguisher equipment, (vii) the parking lot and all underground
utility facilities servicing the Premises, (viii) all elevator equipment; (ix)
the roof membrane system, and (x) all waterscape, landscaping and shrubbery. All
wall surfaces and floor tile are to be maintained in an as good a condition as
when Tenant took possession free of holes, gouges, or defacements. With respect
to items (ii), (viii) and (ix) above, Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of a
service contract between Tenant & a licensed service contractor providing for
periodic maintenance of all such systems or equipment in conformance with the
manufacturer's recommendations. Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of such
preventive maintenance contracts and paid invoices for the recommended work if
requested by Landlord.

If as a part of Tenant's fulfillment of its maintenance obligations during the
last three (3) years of the Lease Term a replacement of the roof membrane is
necessary, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of the replacement less
the sum of (i) Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) plus (ii) that portion of
the cost over $30,000.00 equal to the product of such cost multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years remaining in the Lease
Term, the denominator of which is the useful life (in years) of the roof
replacement; provided, however, that if the roof replacement is made during the
initial Lease Term and Tenant thereafter exercises a renewal option, then upon
Tenant's exercise of the renewal option, the numerator of the fraction shall be
adjusted to the sum of:  (i) the Lease Term remaining at the time the roof
replacement was made; and (ii) the number of years in the Option Term; and
Landlord's reimbursement obligation shall immediately thereafter be re-
calculated.

     C.  Common Area Cost Sharing:   Pursuant to Tenant's maintenance
obligations under this Lease, Tenant is solely responsible for the Common Area
so long as it is leasing all buildings within the Project. In the event Tenant
does not lease all buildings within the Project, Tenant shall remain obligated
for such expenses;

                                    Page 7
<PAGE>

however, the Lease shall be amended to provide for Landlord's management of the
Common Area and reimbursement by Tenant of only its pro rata share, such share
to be calculated based on leased square footage within the Project.

     D. Waiver of Liability:    Failure by Landlord to perform any defined
services, or any cessation thereof, when such failure is caused by accident,
breakage, repairs, strikes, lockout or other labor disturbances or labor
disputes of any character or by any other cause, similar or dissimilar, shall
not render Landlord liable to Tenant in any respect, including damages to either
person or property, except to the extent due to Landlord's active negligence or
willful misconduct, nor be construed as an eviction of Tenant, nor cause an
abatement of rent, nor relieve Tenant from fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement hereof.  Should any equipment or machinery utilized in supplying the
services listed herein break down or for any cause cease to function properly,
upon receipt of written notice from Tenant of any deficiency or failure of any
services, Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to repair the same promptly,
but Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease and shall have no claim
for rebate of rent or damages on account of any interruptions in service
occasioned thereby or resulting therefrom, except to the extent due to
Landlord's active negligence or willful misconduct.  Tenant waives the
provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1941 and 1942 concerning the
Landlord's obligation of tenantability and Tenant's right to make repairs and
deduct the cost of such repairs from the rent.  Landlord shall not be liable for
a loss of or injury to person or property, however occurring, through or in
connection with or incidental to furnishing, or its failure to furnish, any of
the foregoing.

9.   Hazard Insurance:

     A.  Tenant's Use:   Tenant shall not use or permit the Premises, or any
part thereof, to be used for any purpose other than that for which the Premises
are hereby leased; and no use of the Premises shall be made or permitted, nor
acts done, which will cause an increase in premiums or a cancellation of any
insurance policy covering the Premises or any part thereof, nor shall Tenant
sell or permit to be sold, kept, or used in or about the Premises, any article
prohibited by the standard form of fire insurance policies. Tenant shall, at its
sole cost, comply with all requirements of any insurance company or organization
necessary for the maintenance of reasonable fire and public liability insurance
covering the Premises and appurtenances.

     B.  Landlord's Insurance:   Landlord agrees to purchase and keep in force
fire, extended coverage insurance in an amount equal to the replacement cost of
the Buildings (not including any Tenant Improvements or Alterations paid for by
Tenant) as determined by Landlord's insurance company's appraisers. At
Landlord's election, such fire and property damage insurance may be endorsed to
cover loss caused by such additional perils against which Landlord may elect to
insure, including earthquake and/or flood, and shall contain reasonable
deductibles.  Additionally Landlord may maintain a policy of (i) commercial
general liability insurance insuring Landlord (and such others designated by
Landlord) against liability for personal injury, bodily injury, death and damage
to property occurring or resulting from an occurrence in, on or about the
Premises or Project in an amount as Landlord determines is reasonably necessary
for its protection, and (ii) rental loss insurance covering a twelve (12) month
period. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord as additional rent, on demand, the full
cost of said insurance as evidenced by insurance billings to Landlord, and in
the event of damage covered by said insurance, the amount of any deductible
under such policy.  Payment shall be due to Landlord within ten (10) days after
written invoice to Tenant.  It is understood and agreed that Tenant's obligation
under this Section will be prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and
Expiration Dates.

     C.  Tenant's Insurance:   Tenant agrees, at its sole cost, to insure its
personal property, Tenant Improvements, and Alterations for their full
replacement value (without depreciation) and to obtain worker's compensation and
public liability and property damage insurance for occurrences within the
Premises with a combined single limit of not less than Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000.00).  Tenant's liability insurance shall be primary insurance
containing a cross-liability endorsement, and shall provide coverage on an
"occurrence" rather than on a "claims made" basis.  Tenant shall name Landlord
and Landlord's lender as an additional insured and shall deliver a copy of the
policies and renewal certificates to Landlord.  All such policies shall provide
for thirty (30)

                                    Page 8
<PAGE>

days' prior written notice to Landlord of any cancellation, termination, or
reduction in coverage.

     D.  Waiver:   Landlord and Tenant hereby waive all rights each may have
against the other on account of any loss or damage sustained by Landlord or
Tenant, as the case may be, or to the Premises or its contents, which may arise
from any risk covered by their respective insurance policies (or which would
have been covered had such insurance policies been maintained in accordance with
this Lease) as set forth above.  The Parties shall use their reasonable efforts
to obtain from their respective insurance companies a waiver of any right of
subrogation which said insurance company may have against Landlord or Tenant, as
the case may be.

10.  Taxes:   Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay as additional rental,
prior to delinquency, the following:  (i) all taxes and assessments levied
against Tenant's personal property and trade or business fixtures; (ii) all real
estate taxes and assessment installments or other impositions or charges which
may be levied on the Premises or upon the occupancy of the Premises, including
any substitute or additional charges which may be imposed applicable to the
Lease Term; and (iii) real estate tax increases due to an increase in assessed
value resulting from a sale, transfer or other change of ownership of the
Premises as it appears on the City and County tax bills during the Lease Term.
All real estate taxes shall be prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and
Expiration Dates.  If, at any time during the Lease Term a tax, excise on rents,
business license tax or any other tax, however described, is levied or assessed
against Landlord as a substitute or addition, in whole or in part, for taxes
assessed or imposed on land or Buildings, Tenant shall pay and discharge its pro
rata share of such tax or excise on rents or other tax before it becomes
delinquent; except that this provision is not intended to cover net income
taxes, inheritance, gift or estate tax imposed upon Landlord.  In the event that
a tax is placed, levied, or assessed against Landlord and the taxing authority
takes the position that Tenant cannot pay and discharge its pro rata share of
such tax on behalf of Landlord, then Landlord may increase the Base Monthly Rent
by the exact amount of such tax and Tenant shall pay such increase.  If by
virtue of any application or proceeding brought by Landlord, there results a
reduction in the assessed value of the Premises during the Lease Term, Tenant
agrees to pay Landlord a fee consistent with the fees charged by a third party
appeal firm for such services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if property taxes increase during the first three
years of the Lease Term as a result of a reassessment due to a voluntary change
of ownership, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of the resulting property
tax increase as follows:  during the first twelve months, Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of thirty three percent (33%) of the tax increase;
during the second twelve months, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of
sixty seven percent (67%) of the tax increase, thereafter Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of the entire tax increase.

11.  Utilities:   Tenant shall pay directly to the providing utility all water,
gas, electric, telephone, and other utilities supplied to the Premises.
Landlord shall not be liable for loss of or injury to person or property,
however occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to furnishing or
the utility company's failure to furnish utilities to the Premises, and in such
event Tenant shall not be entitled to abatement or reduction of any portion of
Base Monthly Rent or any other amount payable under this Lease.

12.  Toxic Waste and Environmental Damage:

     A.  Tenant's Responsibility: Without the prior written consent of
Landlord, Tenant or Tenant's agents, employees, contractors and invitees
("Tenant's Agents") shall not bring, use, or permit upon the Premises, or
generate, create, release, emit, or dispose (nor permit any of the same) from
the Premises any chemicals, toxic or hazardous gaseous, liquid or solid
materials or waste, including without limitation, material or substance having
characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity or
substances or materials which are listed on any of the Environmental Protection
Agency's lists of hazardous wastes or which are identified in Division 22 Title
26 of the California Code of Regulations as the same may be amended from time to
time or any other similar wastes, materials or substances which are or may
become regulated by or under the authority of any applicable local, state or
federal laws, judgments, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, codes or other
governmental restrictions, guidelines or requirements

                                    Page 9
<PAGE>

("Hazardous Materials") except for those substances customary in typical office
uses for which no consent shall be required. In order to obtain consent, Tenant
shall deliver to Landlord its written proposal describing the toxic material to
be brought onto the Premises, measures to be taken for storage and disposal
thereof, safety measures to be employed to prevent pollution of the air, ground,
surface and ground water. Landlord's approval may be withheld in its reasonable
judgment. In the event Landlord consents to Tenant's use of Hazardous Materials
on the Premises or such consent is not required, Tenant represents and warrants
that it shall comply with all Governmental Regulations applicable to Hazardous
Materials including doing the following: (i) adhere to all reporting and
inspection requirements imposed by Federal, State, County or Municipal laws,
ordinances or regulations and will provide Landlord a copy of any such reports
or agency inspections; (ii) obtain and provide Landlord copies of all necessary
permits required for the use and handling of Hazardous Materials on the
Premises; (iii) enforce Hazardous Materials handling and disposal practices
consistent with industry standards; (iv) surrender the Premises free from any
Hazardous Materials arising from Tenant's bringing, using, permitting,
generating, creating, releasing, emitting or disposing of Hazardous Materials;
and (v) properly close the facility with regard to Hazardous Materials including
the removal or decontamination of any process piping, mechanical ducting,
storage tanks, containers, or trenches which have come into contact with
Hazardous Materials and obtain a closure certificate from the local
administering agency prior to the Expiration Date. Landlord acknowledges and
consents to the storage on the Premises by Tenant of diesel fuel for Tenant's
emergency generators, such storage to be in above-ground tanks reasonably
approved by Landlord.

     B.  Tenant's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials: Tenant shall, at its
sole cost and expense, comply with all laws pertaining to, and shall with
counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Landlord and Landlord's trustees, shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
partners, affiliates, and agents from, any claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses incurred or suffered arising from the bringing, using, permitting,
generating, emitting or disposing of Hazardous Materials by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents through the surface soils of the Premises during the Lease Term or the
violation of any Governmental Regulation or environmental law, by Tenant or
Tenant's Agents. Tenant's foregoing indemnification, defense, and hold harmless
obligations include, without limitation, the following: (i) claims, liability,
costs or expenses resulting from or based upon administrative, judicial (civil
or criminal) or other action, legal or equitable, brought by any private or
public person under common law or under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended ("CERCLA"), the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1980 ("RCRA") or any other federal,
state, county or municipal law, ordinance or regulation now or hereafter in
effect; (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or expenses pertaining to the
identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or removal of Hazardous
Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the provision of an
alternative public drinking water source; (iii) all costs of defending such
claims; (iv) losses attributable to diminution in the value of the Premises or
the Buildings; (v) loss or restriction of use of rentable space in the
Buildings; (vi) adverse effect on the marketing of any space in the Buildings;
and (vi) all other liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, claims, actions
(including remedial or enforcement actions of any kind and administrative or
judicial proceedings, orders or judgments), damages (including consequential and
punitive damages), and costs (including attorney, consultant, and expert fees
and expenses) resulting from the release or violation. This Section 12.B shall
survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.

     C.  Actual Release by Tenant:    Tenant agrees to notify Landlord of any
lawsuits or orders which relate to the remedying of or actual release of
Hazardous Materials on or into the soils or ground water at or under the
Premises.  Tenant shall also provide Landlord all notices required by Section
25359.7(b) of the Health and Safety Code and all other notices required by law
to be given to Landlord in connection with Hazardous Materials.  Without
limiting the foregoing, Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord, within twenty
(20) days after receipt thereof, any written notices from any governmental
agency alleging a material violation of, or material failure to comply with, any
federal, state or local laws, regulations, ordinances or orders, the violation
of which or failure to comply with poses a foreseeable and

                                    Page 10
<PAGE>

material risk of contamination of the ground water or injury to humans (other
than injury solely to Tenant or Tenant's Agents).

     In the event of any release on or into the Premises or into the soil or
ground water under the Premises, the Buildings or the Project of any Hazardous
Materials used, treated, stored or disposed of by Tenant or Tenant's Agents,
Tenant agrees to comply, at its sole cost, with all laws, regulations,
ordinances and orders of any federal, state or local agency relating to the
monitoring or remediation of such Hazardous Materials.  In the event of any such
release of Hazardous Materials Tenant shall immediately give verbal and follow-
up written notice of the release to Landlord, and Tenant agrees to meet and
confer with Landlord and its Lender to attempt to eliminate and mitigate any
financial exposure to such Lender and resultant exposure to Landlord under
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 736(b) as a result of such release,
and promptly to take reasonable monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps given,
inter alia, the historical uses to which the Property has and continues to be
used, the risks to public health posed by the release, the then available
technology and the costs of remediation, cleanup and monitoring, consistent with
acceptable customary practices for the type and severity of such contamination
and all applicable laws.  Nothing in the preceding sentence shall eliminate,
modify or reduce the obligation of Tenant under 12.B of this Lease to indemnify,
defend and hold Landlord harmless from any claims liabilities, costs or expenses
incurred or suffered by Landlord.  Tenant shall provide Landlord prompt written
notice of Tenant's monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps.

     In the absence of an order of any federal, state or local governmental or
quasi-governmental agency relating to the cleanup, remediation or other response
action required by applicable law, any dispute arising between Landlord and
Tenant concerning Tenant's obligation to Landlord under this Section 12.C
concerning the level, method, and manner of cleanup, remediation or response
action required in connection with such a release of Hazardous Materials shall
be resolved by mediation and/or arbitration pursuant to this Lease.

     D.  Environmental Monitoring:    Landlord and its agents shall have the
right to inspect, investigate, sample and monitor the Premises including any
air, soil, water, ground water or other sampling or any other testing, digging,
drilling or analysis to determine whether Tenant is complying with the terms of
this Section 12. If Landlord discovers that Tenant is not in compliance with the
terms of this Section 12, any such costs incurred by Landlord, including
attorneys' and consultants' fees, shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord
within thirty (30) days following Landlord's written demand therefore.

     E.  Landlord's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials: Landlord shall, at
its sole cost and expense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant,
indemnify, defend, and hold Tenant harmless from any claims, liabilities, costs
or expenses incurred or suffered by Tenant related to the release, existence,
removal, investigation, monitoring or remediation of Hazardous Materials which
are present or which come to be present on or beneath the Premises except to the
extent the presence of such Hazardous Materials is caused by Tenant or Tenant's
agents. Landlord's indemnification and hold harmless obligations include,
without limitation, (i) claims, liability, costs or expenses resulting from or
based upon administrative, judicial (civil or criminal) or other action, legal
or equitable, brought by any private or public person under common law or
CERCLA, RCRA, or any other federal, state, county or municipal law, ordinance or
regulation now or hereinafter in effect, (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses pertaining to the identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or
removal of Hazardous Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the
provision of an alternative public drinking water source, and (iii) all costs of
defending such claims. In no event shall Landlord be liable for any
consequential damages suffered or incurred by Tenant as a result of any such
contamination.

13.  Tenant's Default:    The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute a default and breach of this Lease by Tenant:  (i) Tenant's failure
to pay the Base Monthly Rent including additional rent or any other payment due
under this Lease within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of
written notice from Landlord that such Base Monthly Rent or other payment was
not received when due, (ii) the abandonment of the Premises by Tenant; (iii)
Tenant's failure to observe and perform any

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>

other required provision of this Lease, where such failure continues for thirty
(30) days after written notice from Landlord; provided, however, that if the
nature of the default is such that it cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-
day period, Tenant shall not be deemed in default if it commences within such
period to cure, and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion;
(iv) Tenant's making of any general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (v)
the filing by or against Tenant of a petition to have Tenant adjudged a bankrupt
or of a petition for reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to
bankruptcy (unless, in the case of a petition filed against Tenant, the same is
dismissed within sixty (60) days after the filing); (vi) the appointment of a
trustee or receiver to take possession of substantially all of Tenant's assets
located at the Premises or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where possession
is not restored to Tenant within sixty (60) days; or (vii) the attachment,
execution or other judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant's assets
located at the Premises or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where such
seizure is not discharged within sixty (60) days.

     A.  Remedies:   In the event of any such default by Tenant, then in
addition to other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, Landlord
shall have the immediate option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant
hereunder by giving written notice of such intention to terminate. In the event
Landlord elects to so terminate this Lease, Landlord may recover from Tenant all
the following: (i) the worth at time of award of any unpaid rent which had been
earned at the time of such termination; (ii) the worth at time of award of the
amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination
until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss for the same
period that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at
time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the
Lease Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; (iv) any other amount necessary to
compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to
perform its obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of
things would be likely to result therefrom; including the following: (x)
expenses for repairing, altering or remodeling the Premises for purposes of
reletting, (y) broker's fees, advertising costs or other expenses of reletting
the Premises, and (z) costs of carrying the Premises such as taxes, insurance
premiums, utilities and security precautions; and (v) at Landlord's election,
such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be
permitted by applicable California law. The term "rent", as used herein, is
defined as the minimum monthly installments of Base Monthly Rent and all other
sums required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, all such other sums
being deemed as additional rent due hereunder. As used in (i) and (ii) above,
"worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at a rate
equal to the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco plus
five (5%) percent per annum. As used in (iii) above, "worth at the time of
award" shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one (1%)
percent.

     B.  Right to Re-enter:   In the event of any such default by Tenant,
Landlord shall have the right, after terminating this Lease, to re-enter the
Premises and remove all persons and property. Such property may be removed and
stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of
Tenant, and disposed of by Landlord in any manner permitted by law.

     C.  Abandonment:    If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as
provided in Section 13.A or 13.B above, then the provisions of California Civil
Code Section 1951.4, (Landlord may continue the lease in effect after Tenant's
breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due if Tenant has a right
to sublet and assign, subject only to reasonable limitations) as amended from
time to time, shall apply and Landlord may from time to time, without
terminating this Lease, either recover all rental as it becomes due or relet the
Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms and at such rental or
rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its reasonable
discretion may deem advisable, with the right to make alterations and repairs to
the Premises.  In the event that Landlord elects to so relet, rentals received
by Landlord from such reletting shall be applied in the following order to:  (i)
the payment of any indebtedness other than Base Monthly Rent due hereunder from
Tenant to Landlord; (ii) the payment of any cost of such reletting; (iii) the
payment of the cost of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; and (iv)

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>

the payment of Base Monthly Rent due and unpaid hereunder. The residual rentals,
if any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Base Monthly
Rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder. Landlord shall have the
obligation to market the space but shall have no obligation to relet the
Premises following a default if Landlord has other comparable available space
within the Buildings or Project. In the event the portion of rentals received
from such reletting which is applied to the payment of rent hereunder during any
month be less than the rent payable during that month by Tenant hereunder, then
Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand. Such
deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly. Tenant shall also pay to
Landlord, as soon as ascertained, any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in
such reletting or in making such alterations and repairs not covered by the
rentals received from such reletting.

     D.  No Termination:    Landlord's re-entry or taking possession of the
Premises pursuant to 13.B or 13.C shall not be construed as an election to
terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention is given to Tenant
or unless the termination is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any reletting without termination by Landlord because of any
default by Tenant, Landlord may at any time after such reletting elect to
terminate this Lease for any such default.

     E.  Non-Waiver:  Landlord may accept Tenant's payments without waiving any
rights under this Lease, including rights under a previously served notice of
default. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than any
installment of rent due shall be deemed as other than payment on account of the
amount due.  If Landlord accepts payments after serving a notice of default,
Landlord may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and
remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Tenant any
further notice or demand.  Furthermore, the Landlord's acceptance of rent from
the Tenant when the Tenant is holding over without express written consent does
not convert Tenant's Tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month to month
tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Lease shall be implied by any
failure of Landlord to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision,
even if that violation continues or is repeated.  Any waiver by Landlord of any
provision of this Lease must be in writing.  Such waiver shall affect only the
provision specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the
writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Landlord
shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof by
Landlord.  No act or conduct of Landlord, including, without limitation, the
acceptance of keys to the Premises, shall constitute acceptance of the surrender
of the Premises by Tenant before the Expiration Date.  Only written notice from
Landlord to Tenant of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance of surrender
of the Premises.  Landlord's consent to or approval of any act by Tenant which
requires Landlord's consent or approvals shall not be deemed to waive or render
unnecessary Landlord's consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Tenant.

     F.  Performance by Landlord:   If Tenant fails to perform any obligation
required under this Lease or by law or governmental regulation, Landlord in its
sole discretion may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to Tenant, without
waiving any rights or remedies and without releasing Tenant from its obligations
hereunder, perform such obligation, in which event Tenant shall pay Landlord as
additional rent all sums paid by Landlord in connection with such substitute
performance, including interest at the Agreed Interest Rate (as defined in
Section 19.J) within ten (10) days of Landlord's written notice for such
payment.

     G.  Habitual Default:   The provisions of Section 13 notwithstanding, the
Parties agree that if Tenant has been in either monetary default or material
non-monetary default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) in the
performance of any (but not necessarily the same) term or condition of this
Lease for four or more times during any twelve (12) month period during the
Lease Term, then such conduct shall, at the election of the Landlord, represent
a separate event of default which cannot be cured by Tenant.  Tenant
acknowledges that the purpose of this provision is to prevent repetitive
defaults by Tenant, which work a hardship upon Landlord and deprive Landlord of
Tenant's timely performance under this Lease.

14.  Landlord's  Liability:

     A.  Limitation on Landlord's Liability: In the event of Landlord's failure
to perform any of

                                    Page 13
<PAGE>

its covenants or agreements under this Lease, Tenant shall give Landlord written
notice of such failure and shall give Landlord thirty (30) days to cure or
commence to cure such failure prior to any claim for breach or resultant
damages, provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such that it
cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-day period, Landlord shall not be
deemed in default if it commences within such period to cure, and thereafter
diligently prosecutes the same to completion. In addition, upon any such failure
by Landlord, Tenant shall give notice by registered or certified mail to any
person or entity with a security interest in the Premises ("Mortgagee") that has
provided Tenant with notice of its interest in the Premises, and shall provide
Mortgagee a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure, including such time to
obtain possession of the Premises by power of sale or judicial foreclosure, if
such should prove necessary to effectuate a cure. Tenant agrees that each of the
Mortgagees to whom this Lease has been assigned is an expressed third-party
beneficiary hereof. Tenant waives any right under California Civil Code Section
1950.7 or any other present or future law to the collection of any payment or
deposit from Mortgagee or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale of Mortgagee's
interest unless Mortgagee or such purchaser shall have actually received and not
refunded the applicable payment or deposit. Tenant further waives any right to
terminate this Lease and to vacate the Premises on Landlord's default under this
Lease, except in the event of a constructive eviction under law. Tenant's sole
remedy on Landlord's default is an action for damages or injunctive or
declaratory relief.

     B.  Limitation on Tenant's Recourse:   If Landlord is a corporation,
trust, partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association or other form of
business entity, then (i) the obligations of Landlord shall not constitute
personal obligations of the officers, directors, trustees, partners, joint
venturers, members, owners, stockholders, or other principals or representatives
except to the extent of their interest in the Premises. Tenant shall have
recourse only to the interest of Landlord in the Premises or for the
satisfaction of the obligations of Landlord and shall not have recourse to any
other assets of Landlord for the satisfaction of such obligations.

     C.  Indemnification of Landlord:   As a material part of the consideration
rendered to Landlord, Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord for
damages to goods, wares and merchandise, and all other personal property in,
upon or about said Premises and for injuries to persons in or about said
Premises, from any cause arising at any time to the fullest extent permitted by
law, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence
of Landlord, and Tenant shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably
acceptable to Landlord and hold Landlord, and their shareholders, directors,
officers, trustees, employees, partners, affiliates and agents from any claims,
liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or suffered arising from the use of
occupancy of the Premises or any part of the Project by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents, the acts or omissions of Tenant or Tenant's Agents, Tenant's breach of
this Lease, or any damage or injury to person or property from any cause, except
to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence of Landlord
or from the failure of Tenant to keep the Premises in good condition and repair
as herein provided, except to the extent due to the active negligence or willful
misconduct of Landlord.  Further, in the event Landlord is made party to any
litigation due to the acts or omission of Tenant and Tenant's Agents, Tenant
will indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold
Landlord harmless from any such claim or liability including Landlord's costs
and expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in defending such claims.

15.  Destruction of Premises:

     A.  Landlord's Obligation to Restore: In the event of a destruction of the
Premises during the Lease Term Landlord shall repair the same to a similar
condition to that which existed prior to such destruction.  Such destruction
shall not annul or void this Lease; however, Tenant shall be entitled to a
proportionate reduction of Base Monthly Rent while repairs are being made, such
proportionate reduction to be based upon the extent to which the repairs
interfere with Tenant's business in the Premises, as reasonably determined by
Landlord. In no event shall Landlord be required to replace or restore
Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or Tenant's fixtures or personal property.
With respect to a destruction which Landlord is obligated to repair or may elect
to repair under the terms of this Section, Tenant waives the provisions of
Section 1932, and Section 1933, Subdivision 4, of the Civil Code of the State of
California, and any

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>

other similarly enacted statute, and the provisions of this Section 15 shall
govern in the case of such destruction.

     B.  Limitations on Landlord's Restoration Obligation: Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 15.A, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair, or
restore the Premises if any of the following occur:  (i) if the repairs cannot
be made within two hundred seventy (270) days from the date of receipt of all
governmental approvals necessary under the laws and regulations of State,
Federal, County or Municipal authorities, as reasonably determined by Landlord,
(ii) if the holder of the first deed of trust or mortgage encumbering the
Buildings elects not to permit the insurance proceeds payable upon damage or
destruction to be used for such repair or restoration, (iii) the damage or
destruction is not fully covered by the insurance (plus any deductible amount)
maintained by Landlord, (iv) the damage or destruction occurs in the last twenty
four (24) months of the Lease Term, (v) Tenant is in default pursuant to the
provisions of Section 13, or (vi) Tenant has vacated the Premises for more than
the immediately preceding one hundred twenty (120) days.  In any such event
Landlord may elect either to complete the repair or restoration, or terminate
this Lease by providing Tenant written notice of its election within sixty (60)
days following the damage or destruction.  Tenant shall also have a right to
terminate this Lease if the repairs cannot be made within two hundred seventy
(270) days from the date of receipt of all governmental approvals necessary
under the laws and regulations of State, Federal, County or Municipal
authorities, by providing Landlord written notice of its election within sixty
(60) days following the damage or destruction.

16.  Condemnation:  If any part of the Premises shall be taken for any public or
quasi-public use, under any statute or by right of eminent domain or private
purchase in lieu thereof, and only a part thereof remains which is susceptible
of occupation hereunder as reasonably determined by Tenant, this Lease shall, as
to the part so taken, terminate as of the day before title vests in the
condemnor or purchaser ("Vesting Date") and Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder
shall be adjusted so that Tenant is required to pay for the remainder of the
Lease Term only such portion of Base Monthly Rent as the value of the part
remaining after such taking bears to the value of the entire Premises prior to
such taking. If all of the Premises or such part thereof be taken so that there
does not remain a portion susceptible for occupation hereunder as reasonably
determined by Tenant, this Lease shall terminate on the Vesting Date. If part or
all of the Premises be taken, all compensation awarded upon such taking shall go
to Landlord, and Tenant shall have no claim thereto; except Landlord shall
cooperate with Tenant, without cost to Landlord, to recover compensation for
damage to or taking of any Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or for Tenant's
moving costs, loss of or damage to Tenant's personal property, loss to Tenant
because of interruption of business, Tenant's loss of goodwill, and the value
attributable to any leasehold value for the difference between the market value
of the Premises for the remainder or the term above the value, at the date of
taking, of the rent payable for the remainder of the term. Tenant will have no
right to pursue a claim based upon the residual value of the Land after
expiration of the term or pursue claims or retain any award to which Landlord is
entitled so as inequitably to diminish Landlord's award. Tenant hereby waives
the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedures Section 1265.130 and any
other similarly enacted statue, and the provisions of this Section 16 shall
govern in the case of a taking.

17.  Assignment or Sublease:

     A.  Consent by Landlord:   Except as specifically provided in this Section
17, Tenant may not assign, sublet, hypothecate, or allow a third party to use
the Premises without the express written consent of Landlord, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event Tenant desires to
assign this Lease or any interest herein or sublet the Premises or any part
thereof, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord (i) executed counterparts of any
agreement and of all ancillary agreements with the proposed assignee/subtenant,
(ii) current financial statements of the transferee covering the preceding three
years, (iii) the nature of the proposed transferee's business to be carried on
in the Premises, (iv) a statement outlining all consideration to be given on
account of the Transfer, and (v) a current financial statement of Tenant.
Landlord may condition its approval of any Transfer on receipt of a
certification from both Tenant and the proposed transferee of all consideration
to be paid to Tenant in connection with such Transfer.

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>

At Landlord's request, Tenant shall also provide additional information
reasonably required by Landlord to determine whether it will consent to the
proposed assignment or sublease. Landlord shall have a eight (8) business-day
period following receipt of all the foregoing within which to notify Tenant in
writing that Landlord elects to: (i) terminate this Lease in the event the
proposed sublease or assignment is for substantially all of space in the
Premises (provided, however, that Landlord shall not have the right to terminate
on any sublease or assignment expiring, including any options in favor of
sublessee/assignee, more than three (3) years prior to the Lease Expiration
Date, including any options under this Lease which have been exercised by
Tenant); (ii) permit Tenant to assign or sublet such space to the named
assignee/subtenant on the terms and conditions set forth in the notice; or (iii)
refuse consent. If Landlord should fail to notify Tenant in writing of such
election within the 30-day period, Landlord shall be deemed to have elected
option (ii) above. In the event Landlord elects option (i) above, this Lease
shall expire with respect to such part of the Premises on the date upon which
the proposed sublease or transfer was to commence, and from such date forward,
Base Monthly Rent and all other costs and charges shall be adjusted based upon
the proportion that the rentable area of the Premises remaining bears to the
total rentable area of the Buildings. In the event Landlord elects option (ii)
above, Landlord's written consent to the proposed assignment or sublease shall
not be unreasonably withheld, provided and upon the condition that: (i) the
proposed assignee or subtenant is engaged in a business that is limited to the
use expressly permitted under this Lease; (ii) the proposed assignment or
sublease is in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; (iii) the proposed
sublease will not result in there being more than two (2) subtenants within the
Premises at any time during the Lease Term; (iv) Tenant reimburses Landlord on
demand for any reasonable costs that may be incurred by Landlord in connection
with said assignment or sublease, including the costs of making investigations
as to the acceptability of the proposed assignee or subtenant and legal costs
(not to exceed $2,000.00 per occurance) incurred in connection with the granting
of any requested consent; and (v) Tenant shall not have advertised or publicized
in any way the availability of the Premises without prior notice to Landlord. In
the event all or any one of the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, Landlord
shall be considered to have acted reasonably if it withholds its consent.

     B.  Assignment or Subletting Consideration:   Landlord and Tenant hereby
agree that fifty percent (50%) of any rent or other economic consideration (not
including any payments for Tenant's furniture or other personal property owned
by Tenant, any payment for utilities or for other office services provided by
Tenant); (i) realized by Tenant under any sublease or assignment, or (ii)
realized by any subtenant under any sub-sublease of the Premises, in excess of
the Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder after deducting reasonable subletting
and assignment costs directly related to such sublease or assignment including
lease commissions, attorneys fees, costs of demising or otherwise preparing the
sublease space for occupancy, and the unamortized cost of Alterations applicable
to the space so sublet or assigned, shall be paid to Landlord. Tenant's
obligation to pay over Landlord's portion of the consideration constitutes an
obligation for additional rent hereunder. The above provisions relating to
Landlord's right to terminate the Lease and relating to the allocation of excess
rent are independently negotiated terms of the Lease which constitute a material
inducement for the Landlord to enter into the Lease, and are agreed by the
Parties to be commercially reasonable. No assignment or subletting by Tenant
shall relieve it of any obligation under this Lease. Any assignment or
subletting which conflicts with the provisions hereof shall be void.

     C.  No Release:   Any assignment or sublease shall be made only if and
shall not be effective until the assignee or subtenant shall execute,
acknowledge, and deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form and substance
satisfactory to Landlord, whereby the assignee or subtenant shall assume all the
applicable obligations of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed or
observed and shall be subject to all the covenants, agreements, terms,
provisions and conditions in this Lease. Notwithstanding any such sublease or
assignment and the acceptance of rent by Landlord from any subtenant or
assignee, Tenant and any guarantor shall remain fully liable for the payment of
Base Monthly Rent and additional rent due, and to become due hereunder, for the
performance of all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions
contained in this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>

and for all acts and omissions of any licensee, subtenant, assignee or any other
person claiming under or through any subtenant or assignee that shall be in
violation of any of the terms and conditions of this Lease, and any such
violation shall be deemed a violation by Tenant. Tenant shall indemnify, defend
and hold Landlord harmless from and against all losses, liabilities, damages,
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any
claims that may be made against Landlord by the proposed assignee or subtenant
(except to the extent caused by Landlord's gross negligence or willful
misconduct) or by any real estate brokers or other persons claiming compensation
in connection with the proposed assignment or sublease.

     D.  Reorganization of Tenant:  The provisions of this Section 17.D shall
apply if Tenant is a corporation and: (i) there is a dissolution, merger,
consolidation, or other reorganization of or affecting Tenant, where Tenant is
not the surviving corporation, or (ii) there is a sale or transfer to one person
or entity (or to any group of related persons or entities) of stock possessing
more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Tenant's
capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of
directors, and after such sale or transfer of stock Tenant's stock is no longer
publicly traded. In a transaction under clause (i) the surviving corporation
shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement in form reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord under which such surviving corporation assumes the
obligations of Tenant hereunder, and in a transaction under clause (ii) the
transferee or buyer shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement
in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord under which such transferee or buyer
assumes the obligations of Tenant under the Lease.

     E.  Permitted Transfers:   Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 17, so long as Tenant otherwise complies with the provisions of this
Article, Tenant may enter into any of the following transfers (a "Permitted
Transfer") without Landlord's prior consent, and Landlord shall not be entitled
to terminate the Lease or to receive any part of any subrent resulting therefrom
that would otherwise be due pursuant to Sections 17.A and 17.B. Tenant may
sublease all or part of the Premises or assign its interest in this Lease to (i)
any corporation which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with the original Tenant to this Lease by means of an ownership interest of more
than 50%; (ii) a corporation which results from a merger, consolidation or other
reorganization in which Tenant is not the surviving corporation, so long as the
surviving corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is
equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such
transaction; and (iii) a corporation which purchases or otherwise acquires all
or substantially all of the assets of Tenant so long as such acquiring
corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is equal to or
greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such transaction.

     F.  Effect of Default:   In the event of Tenant's default, Tenant hereby
assigns all rents due from any assignment or subletting to Landlord as security
for performance of its obligations under this Lease, and Landlord may collect
such rents as Tenant's Attorney-in-Fact, except that Tenant may collect such
rents unless a default occurs as described in Section 13 above.  A termination
of the Lease due to Tenant's default shall not automatically terminate an
assignment or sublease then in existence; rather at Landlord's election, such
assignment or sublease shall survive the Lease termination, the assignee or
subtenant shall attorn to Landlord, and Landlord shall undertake the obligations
of Tenant under the sublease or assignment; except that Landlord shall not be
liable for prepaid rent, security deposits or other defaults of Tenant to the
subtenant or assignee, or for any acts or omissions of Tenant and Tenant's
Agents.

     G.  Conveyance by Landlord:  As used in this Lease, the term "Landlord" is
defined only as the owner for the time being of the Premises, so that in the
event of any sale or other conveyance of the Premises or in the event of a
master lease of the Premises, Landlord shall be entirely freed and relieved of
all its covenants and obligations hereunder, and it shall be deemed and
construed, without further agreement between the Parties and the purchaser at
any such sale or the master tenant of the Premises, that the purchaser or master
tenant of the Premises has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants
and obligations of Landlord hereunder.  Such transferor shall transfer and
deliver Tenant's security deposit to the purchaser at any such sale or the
master tenant of the Premises, and

                                    Page 17
<PAGE>

thereupon the transferor shall be discharged from any further liability in
reference thereto.

     F.  Successors and Assigns:   Subject to the provisions this Section 17,
the covenants and conditions of this Lease shall apply to and bind the heirs,
successors, executors, administrators and assigns of all Parties hereto; and all
Parties hereto comprising Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable
hereunder.

18.  Option to Extend the Lease Term:

     A.  Grant and Exercise of Option:  Provided Tenant simultaneously exercises
its option to extend the lease term for Building 4, Landlord grants to Tenant,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 18.A, two (2)
options (the "Options") to extend the Lease Term for an additional term (the
"Option Term").  Each Option Term shall be for a period of sixty (60) months and
shall be exercised, if at all, by written notice to Landlord no later than nine
(9) months prior to the date the Lease Term would expire but for such exercise,
time being of the essence for the giving of such notice.  If Tenant exercises
the Option, all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease except for
the grant of additional Options pursuant to this Section, provided that Base
Monthly Rent for the Premises payable by Tenant during the Option Term shall be
the greater of (i) the Base Monthly Rent applicable to the period immediately
prior to the commencement of the Option Term, and (ii) ninety five percent (95%)
of the Fair Market Rental as hereinafter defined.  Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if Tenant is in monetary or material non-monetary
default under any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease (beyond
applicable cure periods) either at the time Tenant exercises the Option or at
any time thereafter prior to the commencement date of the Option Term, then
Landlord shall have, in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies
provided in this Lease, the right to terminate the Option upon notice to Tenant,
in which event the Lease Term shall not be extended pursuant to this Section
18.A.  As used herein, the term "Fair Market Rental" is defined as the rental
and all other monetary payments, including any escalations and adjustments
thereto (including without limitation Consumer Price Indexing) that Landlord
could obtain during the Option Term from a third party desiring to lease the
Premises, based upon the current use and other potential uses of the Premises,
as determined by the rents then being obtained for new leases of space
comparable in age and quality to the Premises in the same real estate submarket
as the Buildings.  The appraisers shall be instructed that the foregoing five
percent (5%) discount is intended to offset comparable rents that include the
following costs which Landlord will not incur in the event Tenant exercises its
option (i) brokerage commissions, (ii) tenant improvement allowances, (iii)
building improvement costs, and (iv) vacancy costs.

     B.  Determination of Fair Market Rental:    If Tenant exercises the Option,
Landlord shall send Tenant notice no later than two hundred forty (240) days
before to the Lease Expiration Date setting forth the Fair Market Rental for the
Option Term.  If Tenant disputes Landlord's determination of Fair Market Rental
for the Option Term, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of
Landlord's notice setting forth Fair Market Rental for the Option Term, send to
Landlord a notice stating that Tenant either elects to terminate its exercise of
the Option, in which event the Option shall lapse and this Lease shall terminate
on the Expiration Date, or that Tenant disagrees with Landlord's determination
of Fair Market Rental for the Option Term and elects to resolve the disagreement
as provided in Section 18.C below. If Tenant does not send Landlord a notice as
provided in the previous sentence, Landlord's determination of Fair Market
Rental shall be the basis for computing the Base Monthly Rent payable by Tenant
during the Option Term.  If Tenant elects to resolve the disagreement as
provided in Section 18.C and such procedures are not concluded prior to the
commencement date of the Option Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Base
Monthly Rent ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as determined
by Landlord in the manner provided above.  If the Fair Market Rental as finally
determined pursuant to Section 18.C is greater than Landlord's determination,
Tenant shall pay Landlord the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and
ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so determined in Section
18.C within thirty (30) days after such determination.  If the Fair Market
Rental as finally determined in Section 18.C is less than Landlord's
determination, the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and ninety five
percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so determined in Section 18.C shall
be credited against the next installments of Base Monthly

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>

Rent due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder.

     C.  Resolution of a Disagreement over the Fair Market Rental:   Any
disagreement regarding Fair Market Rental shall be resolved as follows:

         1.   Within thirty (30) days after Tenant's response to Landlord's
notice setting forth the Fair Market Rental, Landlord and Tenant shall meet at a
mutually agreeable time and place, in an attempt to resolve the disagreement.

         2.   If within the 30-day period referred to above, Landlord and Tenant
cannot reach agreement as to Fair Market Rental, each party shall select one
appraiser to determine Fair Market Rental.  Each such appraiser shall arrive at
a determination of Fair Market Rental and submit their conclusions to Landlord
and Tenant within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the 30-day
consultation period described above.

         3.   If only one appraisal is submitted within the requisite time
period, it shall be deemed as Fair Market Rental. If both appraisals are
submitted within such time period and the two appraisals so submitted differ by
less than ten percent (10%), the average of the two shall be deemed as Fair
Market Rental. If the two appraisals differ by more than 10%, the appraisers
shall immediately select a third appraiser who shall, within thirty (30) days
after his selection, make and submit to Landlord and Tenant a determination of
Fair Market Rental. This third appraisal will then be averaged with the closer
of the two previous appraisals and the result shall be Fair Market Rental.

         4.   All appraisers specified pursuant to this Section shall be members
of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers with not less than ten (10)
years experience appraising office and industrial properties in the Santa Clara
Valley. Each party shall pay the cost of the appraiser selected by such party
and one-half of the cost of the third appraiser.

     D.  Personal to Tenant:   All Options provided to Tenant in this Lease are
personal and granted to VeriSign, Inc. (and any permitted transferee pursuant to
Section 17.E. above) and are not exercisable by any third party should Tenant
assign or sublet all or a portion of its rights under this Lease, unless
Landlord consents to permit exercise of any option by any assignee or subtenant,
in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion.  In the event Tenant has multiple
options to extend this Lease, a later option to extend the Lease cannot be
exercised unless the prior option has been properly exercised.

19.  General Provisions:

     A.  Attorney's Fees:   In the event a suit or alternative form of dispute
resolution is brought for the possession of the Premises, for the recovery of
any sum due hereunder, to interpret the Lease, or because of the breach of any
other covenant herein; then the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party
reasonable attorney's fees including the expense of expert witnesses,
depositions and court testimony as part of its costs which shall be deemed to
have accrued on the commencement of such action.  The prevailing party shall
also be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including reasonable
attorney's fees incurred in enforcing any judgment or award against the other
party.  The foregoing provision relating to post-judgment costs is severable
from all other provisions of this Lease.

     B.  Authority of Parties:  Tenant represents and warrants that it is duly
formed and in good standing, and is duly authorized to execute and deliver this
Lease on behalf of said corporation, in accordance with a duly adopted
resolution of the Board of Directors of said corporation or in accordance with
the by-laws of said corporation, and that this Lease is binding upon said
corporation in accordance with its terms.  At Landlord's request, Tenant shall
provide Landlord with corporate resolutions or other proof in a form acceptable
to Landlord, authorizing the execution of the Lease.

     C.  Brokers:   Tenant represents it has not utilized or contacted a real
estate broker or finder with respect to this Lease other than Cornish & Carey
Commercial and Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless
against any claim, cost, liability or cause of action asserted by any other
broker or finder claiming through Tenant.

     D.  Choice of Law:   This Lease shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with California law.   Except as provided in Section 19.E, venue
shall be Santa Clara County.

                                    Page 19

     E.  Dispute Resolution: Landlord and Tenant and any other party that may
become a party to this Lease or be deemed a party to this Lease including any
subtenants agree that, except for any claim by Landlord for unlawful detainer or
any claim within the jurisdiction of the small claims court (which small claims
court shall be the sole court of competent jurisdiction), any controversy,
dispute, or claim of whatever nature arising out of, in connection with or in
relation to the interpretation, performance or breach of this Lease, including
any claim based on contract, tort, or statute, shall be resolved at the request
of any party to this agreement through a two-step dispute resolution process
administered by J.A.M.S. or another judicial mediation service mutually
acceptable to the parties located in Santa Clara County, California. The dispute
resolution process shall involve first, mediation, followed, if necessary, by
final and binding arbitration administered by and in accordance with the then
existing rules and practices of J.A.M.S. or other judicial mediation service
selected. In the event of any dispute subject to this provision, either party
may initiate a request for mediation and the parties shall use reasonable
efforts to promptly select a J.A.M.S. mediator and commence the mediation. In
the event the parties are not able to agree on a mediator within thirty (30)
days, J.A.M.S. or another judicial mediation service mutually acceptable to
the parties shall appoint a mediator. The mediation shall be confidential and in
accordance with California Evidence Code (S) 1119 et. seq. The mediation shall
be held in Santa Clara County, California and in accordance with the existing
rules and practice of J.A.M.S. (or other judicial and mediation service
selected). The parties shall use reasonable efforts to conclude the mediation
within sixty (60) days of the date of either party's request for mediation. The
mediation shall be held prior to any arbitration or court action (other than a
claim by Landlord for unlawful detainer or any claim within the jurisdiction of
the small claims court which are not subject to this mediation/arbitration
provision and may be filed directly with a court of competent jurisdiction).
Should the prevailing party in any dispute subject to this Section 19.E attempt
an arbitration or a court action before attempting to mediate, the prevailing
party shall not be entitled to attorney's fees that might otherwise be available
to them in a court action or arbitration and in addition thereto, the party who
is determined by the arbitrator to have resisted mediation, shall be sanctioned
by the arbitrator or judge.

IF A MEDIATION IS CONDUCTED BUT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, IT SHALL BE FOLLOWED BY FINAL
AND BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEN EXISTING
RULES AND PRACTICES OF J.A.M.S. OR THE OTHER JUDICIAL AND MEDIATION SERVICE
SELECTED, AND JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY BE
ENTERED BY ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF AS PROVIDED BY
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1280 ET. SEQ, AS SAID STATUTES THEN
APPEAR, INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS TO SAID STATUTES OR SUCCESSORS TO SAID STATUTES
OR AMENDED STATUTES, EXCEPT THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PARTIES BE ENTITLED TO
PROPOUND INTERROGATORIES OR REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS DURING THE ARBITRATION
PROCESS. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE A RETIRED JUDGE OR A LICENSED CALIFORNIA
ATTORNEY. THE VENUE FOR ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR MEDIATION SHALL BE IN SANTA
CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.

LANDLORD:  /s/ JMS        TENANT:  /s/ DLE
         ------------            ------------
     F.  Entire Agreement:  This Lease and the exhibits attached hereto contains
all of the agreements and conditions made between the Parties hereto and may not
be modified orally or in any other manner other than by written agreement signed
by all parties hereto or their respective successors in interest.  This Lease
supersedes and revokes all previous negotiations, letters of intent, lease
proposals, brochures, agreements, representations, promises, warranties, and
understandings, whether oral or in writing, between the parties or their
respective representatives or any other person purporting to represent Landlord
or Tenant.

     G.  Entry by Landlord:  Upon prior notice to Tenant and subject to Tenant's
reasonable security regulations, Tenant shall permit Landlord and his agents to
enter into and upon the Premises at all reasonable times, and without any rent
abatement or reduction or any liability to Tenant for any reasonable loss of
occupation or quiet enjoyment of the Premises thereby occasioned, for the
following purposes:  (i) inspecting and maintaining the Premises; (ii) making
repairs, alterations or additions to the Premises; (iii) erecting additional
building(s) and improvements on the land where the Premises are situated or on
adjacent land owned by Landlord; (iv) performing any obligations of Landlord
under the Lease including remediation of Hazardous Materials if determined to be
the responsibility of Landlord, (v) posting and keeping posted thereon notices
of non-responsibility for any construction, alteration or repair thereof, as
required or permitted by any law, and (vi) showing the Premises to Landlord's or
the Master Landlord's existing or potential successors, purchaser, tenants and
lenders.  Tenant shall permit Landlord and his agents, at any time within one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Expiration Date (or at any time during
the Lease if Tenant is in default hereunder), to place upon the Premises "For
Lease" signs and exhibit the Premises to real estate brokers and prospective
tenants at reasonable hours.

     H.  Estoppel Certificates:   At any time during the Lease Term, each party
(the "Responding Party") shall, within ten (10) business days following written
notice from the other party (the "Requesting Party"), execute and deliver to the
Requesting Party a written statement certifying, if true, the following:  (i)
that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified,
stating the nature of such modification); (ii) the date to which rent and other
charges are paid in advance, if any; (iii) acknowledging that there are not, to
Responding Party's knowledge, any uncured defaults on Requesting Party's part
hereunder (or specifying such defaults if they are claimed); and (iv) such other
information as Requesting Party may reasonably request.  Any such statement may
be conclusively relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of
Requesting Party's interest in the Premises.  The Responding Party's failure to
deliver such statement within such time shall be conclusive upon the Responding
Party that this Lease is in full force and effect without modification, except
as may be represented by the Requesting Party, and that there are no uncured
defaults in Requesting Party's performance.  Tenant agrees to provide, within
five (5) days of Landlord's request, Tenant's most recent three (3) years of
audited financial statements for Landlord's use in financing or sale of the
Premises or Landlord's interest therein.

     I.  Exhibits:   All exhibits referred to are attached to this Lease and
incorporated by reference.

     J.  Interest:   All rent due hereunder, if not paid when due, shall bear
interest at the rate of the Reference Rate published by Bank of America, San
Francisco Branch, plus two percent (2%) per annum from that date until paid in
full ("Agreed Interest Rate").  This provision shall survive the expiration or
sooner termination of the Lease.  Despite any other provision of this Lease, the
total liability for interest payments shall not exceed the limits, if any,
imposed by the usury laws of the State of California.  Any interest paid in
excess of those limits shall be refunded to Tenant by application of the amount
of excess interest paid against any sums outstanding in any order that Landlord
requires.  If the amount of excess interest paid exceeds the sums outstanding,
the portion exceeding those sums shall be refunded in cash to Tenant by
Landlord.  To ascertain whether any interest payable exceeds the limits imposed,
any non-principal payment (including late

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>

charges) shall be considered to the extent permitted by law to be an expense or
a fee, premium, or penalty rather than interest.

     K.  This section intentionally left blank.

     L.  No Presumption Against Drafter:   Landlord and Tenant understand, agree
and acknowledge that this Lease has been freely negotiated by both Parties; and
that in any controversy, dispute, or contest over the meaning, interpretation,
validity, or enforceability of this Lease or any of its terms or conditions,
there shall be no inference, presumption, or conclusion drawn whatsoever against
either party by virtue of that party having drafted this Lease or any portion
thereof.

     M.  Notices:   All notices, demands, requests, or consents required to be
given under this Lease shall be sent in writing by U.S. certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal delivery addressed to the party to be notified
at the address for such party specified in Section 1 of this Lease, or to such
other place as the party to be notified may from time to time designate by at
least fifteen (15) days prior notice to the notifying party.  When this Lease
requires service of a notice, that notice shall satisfy rather than supplement
any similar statutorily required notice, including any notice required by Code
of Civil Procedure Section 1161 or any similar or successor statute.  When a
statute requires service of a notice in a particular manner, service of such
notice in the manner described in the first sentence of this Section 19.M. shall
satisfy such statutory requirement.

     N.  Property Management:   In addition, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord along
with the expenses to be reimbursed by Tenant a monthly fee for management
services rendered by either Landlord or a third party manager engaged by
Landlord (which may be a party affiliated with Landlord), in the amount of three
percent (3%) of the Base Monthly Rent.

     O.  Rent:   All monetary sums due from Tenant to Landlord under this Lease,
including, without limitation those referred to as "additional rent", shall be
deemed as rent.

     P.  Representations:   Tenant acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any of
its employees or agents have made any agreements, representations, warranties or
promises with respect to the Premises or with respect to present or future
rents, expenses, operations, tenancies or any other matter.  Except as herein
expressly set forth herein, Tenant relied on no statement of Landlord or its
employees or agents for that purpose.

     Q.  Rights and Remedies:   Subject to Section 14 above, All rights and
remedies hereunder are cumulative and not alternative to the extent permitted by
law, and are in addition to all other rights and remedies in law and in equity.

     R.  Severability:   If any term or provision of this Lease is held
unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
the Lease shall not be invalidated thereby but shall be enforceable in
accordance with its terms, omitting the invalid or unenforceable term.

     S.  Submission of Lease:   Submission of this document for examination or
signature by the parties does not constitute an option or offer to lease the
Premises on the terms in this document or a reservation of the Premises in favor
of Tenant.  This document is not effective as a lease or otherwise until
executed and delivered by both Landlord and Tenant.

     T. Subordination:   This Lease is subject and subordinate to ground and
underlying leases, mortgages and deeds of trust (collectively "Encumbrances")
which may now affect the Premises, to any covenants, conditions or restrictions
of record, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and
extensions thereof; provided, however, if the holder or holders of any such
Encumbrance ("Holder") require that this Lease be prior and superior thereto,
within seven (7) days after written request of Landlord to Tenant, Tenant shall
execute, have acknowledged and deliver all documents or instruments, in the
commercially reasonable form presented to Tenant, which Landlord or Holder deems
necessary or desirable for such purposes.  Landlord shall have the right to
cause this Lease to be and become and remain subject and subordinate to any and
all Encumbrances which are now or may hereafter be executed covering the
Premises or any renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements or
extensions thereof, for the full amount of all advances made or to be made
thereunder and without regard to the time or character of such advances,
together with interest thereon and subject to all the terms and provisions
thereof; provided only, that in

                                    Page 22

the event of termination of any such lease or upon the foreclosure of any such
mortgage or deed of trust, Holder agrees to recognize Tenant's rights under this
Lease as long as Tenant is not in default either at the time Holder recognizes
such rights or at any time thereafter. Within ten (10) business days after
Landlord's written request, Tenant shall execute any documents in commercially
reasonable form required by Landlord or the Holder to make this Lease
subordinate to any lien of the Encumbrance, provided that within those documents
the Tenant's rights under this Lease are recognized only as long as Tenant is
not in default. If Tenant fails to do so, then in addition to such failure
constituting a default by Tenant, it shall be deemed that this Lease is so
subordinated to such Encumbrance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section, Tenant hereby attorns and agrees to attorn to any entity
purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Premises at any sale or other proceeding
or pursuant to the exercise of any other rights, powers or remedies under such
encumbrance.

Landlord shall cause the existing lender to furnish to Tenant, within sixty (60)
days of the date of both parties' execution of this Lease, with a written
agreement providing for (i) recognition by the lender of all of the terms and
conditions of this Lease; and (ii) continuation of this Lease upon foreclosure
of existing lender's security interest in the Premises.  In the event that
Landlord is unable to provide such agreement, Tenant's sole remedy shall be
termination of the Lease, which election shall be made within fourteen (14) days
following the expiration of such sixty (60) day period.

     U.  Survival of Indemnities: All indemnification, defense, and hold
harmless obligations of Landlord and Tenant under this Lease shall survive the
expiration or sooner termination of the Lease.

     V.  Time:   Time is of the essence hereunder.

     W.  Transportation Demand Management Programs: Should a government agency
or municipality require Landlord to institute TDM (Transportation Demand
Management) facilities and/or programs, Tenant agrees that the cost of TDM
imposed facilities and programs required on the Premises, including but not
limited to employee showers, lockers, cafeteria, or lunchroom facilities, shall
be paid by Tenant. Further, any ongoing costs or expenses associated with a TDM
program which are required for the Premises and not provided by Tenant, such as
an on-site TDM coordinator, shall be provided by Landlord with such costs being
included as additional rent and reimbursed to Landlord by Tenant within thirty
(30) days after demand. If TDM facilities and programs are instituted on a
Project wide basis, Tenant shall pay its proportionate share of such costs in
accordance with Section 8 above.

     X.  Waiver of Right to Jury Trial:   Landlord and Tenant waive their
respective rights to trial by jury of any contract or tort claim, counterclaim,
cross-complaint, or cause of action in any action, proceeding, or hearing
brought by either party against the other on any matter arising out of or in any
way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, or
Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, including any claim of injury or
damage or the enforcement of any remedy under any current or future law,
statute, regulation, code, or ordinance.

     Y.  Recordation:   A short form Memorandum of Lease, in form and content
reasonably acceptable to the parties, will be executed in recordable form by
each party following execution of this Lease, delivered to Tenant, and may be
recorded by Tenant at its expense.

20.  Right of First offer to purchase:

     A.  Grant and Exercise of Option:   In the event Landlord elects to sell
the Buildings either separately or as part of a larger sale including other
building(s) within the Project ("Offered Property"), Landlord (referred to
hereinafter in this Section 20 as "Seller") hereby grants Tenant a right of
first offering to purchase.  Prior to Seller committing to sell its interest in
the Offered Property to a third party, Seller shall give Tenant written notice
of such desire and the terms and other information under which Seller intends to
sell the Offered Property.  Provided at the time of such written notice:  (i)
Tenant leases at least two buildings within the Project; and (ii) Tenant is not
in default under the Lease beyond the expiration of any applicable cure period,
Tenant shall have the option, which must be exercised, if at all, by written
notice to Seller within fifteen (15) days after Tenant's receipt of Seller's
notice, to

                                    Page 23
<PAGE>

purchase Seller's interest in the Offered Property at the sales price and terms
of sale specified in the notice. In the event Tenant timely exercises such
option to purchase its interest in the Offered Property, Seller shall sell its
interest in the Offered Property to Tenant, and Tenant shall purchase its
interest in the Offered Property from Seller in accordance with the price and
terms specified in Seller's notice. Seller and Tenant shall, in good faith,
attempt to reach agreement on the terms of a mutually acceptable purchase
agreement consistent with the terms set forth in Seller's notice within thirty
(30) days of Tenant's exercise of its option to purchase. In the event either:
(i) Tenant fails to exercise Tenant's option within said 15-day period; or (ii)
after Tenant's exercise, Seller and Tenant are unable to reach agreement on a
mutually acceptable purchase agreement within the subsequent 30-day period;
Seller shall have one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter to sell its interest
in the Offered Property at no less than ninety percent (90%) of the sales price
and upon substantially the same other terms of sale as specified in the notice
to Tenant. In the event Seller fails to sell its interest in the Offered
Property within said one hundred eighty (180) day period or in the event Seller
proposes to sell its interest in the Offered Property at less than ninety
percent (90%) of the sales price or on other material terms which are more
favorable to the prospective buyer than that proposed to Tenant, Seller shall be
required to resubmit such offer to Tenant in accordance with this Right of First
Offering except that Tenant shall be required to respond to any resubmission
within a seven (7) day period.

     B.  Exclusions:   This Right of First Offering shall automatically
terminate (i) upon the expiration or sooner termination of the Lease, or (ii) in
the event of a foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of Landlord's interest
in the Buildings. Further, this Right of First Offering shall not apply to
transfers (but shall survive such transfers) of all or a portion of the
Buildings or Project to (i) John A. Sobrato and/or John M. Sobrato (individually
and collectively "Sobrato"), (ii) any immediate family member of Sobrato, (iii)
any trust established, in whole or in part, for the benefit of Sobrato and/or
any immediate family member of Sobrato, (iv) any partnership in which Sobrato or
any immediate family member, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a
partnership or corporate entity or a trust) retains a general partner interest,
and/or (v) any corporation under the control, either directly or indirectly, by
Sobrato or any immediate family member of Sobrato.

so long as is reasonably necessary to complete the loading and unloading.
Landlord makes no representation or warranty that any specific use of the
Premises desired by Tenant is permitted pursuant to any Laws.

     B. Uses Prohibited: Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed on
the Premises any waste, nuisance, or other act or thing which may disturb the
quiet enjoyment of any other tenant in or around the Premises, nor allow any
sale by auction or any other use of the Premises for an unlawful purpose. Tenant
shall not (i) damage or overload the electrical, mechanical or plumbing systems
of the Premises, (ii) attach, hang or suspend anything from the ceiling, walls
or columns of the building in excess of the load limits for which such items are
designed or set any load on the floor in excess of the load limits for which for
which the floor is designed, or (iii) generate

                                    Page 2
<PAGE>

dust, fumes or waste products which create a fire or health hazard or damage the
Premises or any portion of the Project, including without limitation the soils
or ground water in or around the Project. No materials, supplies, equipment,
finished products or semi-finished products, raw materials or articles of any
nature, or any waste materials, refuse, scrap or debris, shall be stored upon or
permitted to remain on any portion of the Premises outside of the Building
without Landlord's prior approval, which approval may be withheld in its
reasonable discretion.

     C. Advertisements and Signs: Tenant will not place or permit to be placed,
in, upon or about the Premises any signs in violation of the city and other
governing authority having jurisdiction. Tenant will not place or permit to be
placed upon the Premises any large prominent outdoor signs, advertisements or
notices without the written consent of Landlord as to type, size, design,
lettering, coloring and location, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld. Any sign placed on the Premises shall be removed by Tenant, at its
sole cost, prior to the Expiration Date or promptly following the earlier
termination of the Lease, and Tenant shall repair, at its sole cost, any damage
or injury to the Premises caused thereby, and if not so removed, then Landlord
may have same so removed at Tenant's expense.

     D. Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions: This Lease is subject to the
effect of (i) any covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, mortgages or
deeds of trust, ground leases, rights of way of record and any other matters or
documents of record; and (ii) any zoning laws of the city, county and state
where the Building is situated (collectively referred to herein as
"Restrictions") and Tenant will conform to and will not violate the terms of any
such Restrictions.

4.   TERM AND RENTAL:

     A. Base Monthly Rent: The term ("Lease Term") shall be for one hundred
twenty (120) months, with a commencement date ("Commencement Date") of either:
(i) substantial completion of construction as determined pursuant to Section
5.B, estimated to occur on August 1 2002; or (ii) sixty (60) days following
Landlord's notice to Tenant pursuant to Section 2.D. above that Landlord is
unable to obtain timely TOD approval, and ending one hundred twenty (120) months
thereafter ("Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the parties' agreement that the
Lease Term begins on the Commencement Date, this Lease and all of the
obligations of Landlord and Tenant shall be binding and in full force and effect
from and after the Effective Date. In addition to all other sums payable by
Tenant under this Lease, Tenant shall pay as base monthly rent ("Base Monthly
Rent") for the Premises an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying:
(i) the rentable square footage ("Rentable Square Footage") of the Premises; by
(ii) the per-square-foot rental rate for Buildings 2 and 3 as of the
Commencement Date. The Base Monthly Rent shall at all times during this Lease be
calculated by using the same per-square-foot rate and subject to the same
increases, and at the same time, as for Buildings 2 and 3.

Upon Substantial Completion of construction, the Building shall be measured by
Tenant's Architect (as defined in Section 5.B) from outside wall/glass to
outside wall/glass of each floor, without deductions, to arrive at the actual
"Rentable Square Footage". If the Rentable Square Footage differs from 102,000
square feet, the Base Monthly Rent due during the Lease Term shall be modified
so as to equal at all times during the Lease Term the product of (i) the
Rentable Square Footage; and (ii) the then price-per-square-foot rate for
Buildings 2 and 3.

Base Monthly Rent shall be due in advance on or before the first day of each
calendar month during the Lease Term. All sums payable by Tenant under this
Lease shall be paid to Landlord in lawful money of the United States of America,
without offset or deduction and without prior notice or demand, at the address
specified in Section 1 of this Lease or at such place or places as may be
designated in writing by Landlord during the Lease Term. Base Monthly Rent for
any period less than a calendar month shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly
installment. On or before the date that is forty-five (45) days prior to the
Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay to Landlord the Base Monthly Rent due for
the first month of the Lease.

     B. Late Charges: Tenant hereby acknowledges that late payment by Tenant to
Landlord of Base Monthly Rent and other sums due hereunder will cause Landlord
to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which is
extremely difficult to

                                    Page 3
<PAGE>

ascertain. Such costs include but are not limited to: administrative,
processing, accounting, and late charges which may be imposed on Landlord by the
terms of any contract, revolving credit, mortgage, or trust deed covering the
Premises. Accordingly, if any installment of Base Monthly Rent or other sum due
from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or its designee within five (5)
business days after receipt by Tenant of written notice from Landlord that such
installment or sum was not received when due, Tenant shall pay to Landlord a
late charge equal to five (5%) percent of such overdue amount, which late charge
shall be due and payable on the same date that the overdue amount was due. The
parties agree that such late charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate of
the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late payment by Tenant, excluding
interest and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. If any rent or other sum due
from Tenant remains delinquent for a period in excess of thirty (30) days then,
in addition to such late charge, Tenant shall pay to Landlord interest on any
rent that is not paid when due at the Agreed Interest Rate specified in Section
19.J following the date such amount became due until paid. Acceptance by
Landlord of such late charge shall not constitute a waiver of Tenant's default
with respect to such overdue amount nor prevent Landlord from exercising any of
the other rights and remedies granted hereunder. In the event that a late charge
is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for four (4) consecutive
installments of Base Monthly Rent, then the Base Monthly Rent shall
automatically become due and payable quarterly in advance, rather than monthly,
notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary.

     C. Security Deposit: On or before April 1, 2001, Tenant shall deposit with
Landlord the sum of Seven Hundred Eighty Thousand and No/100 Dollars
($780,000.00) ("Security "Deposit"). Landlord shall not be deemed a trustee of
the Security Deposit, may use the Security Deposit in business, and shall not be
required to segregate it from its general accounts. Tenant shall not be entitled
to interest on the Security Deposit. If Tenant defaults with respect to any
provisions of the Lease, including but not limited to the provisions relating to
payment of Base Monthly Rent or other charges, Landlord may, to the extent
reasonably necessary to remedy Tenant's default, use any or all of the Security
Deposit towards payment of the following: (i) Base Monthly Rent or other charges
in default; (ii) any other amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated
to spend by reason of Tenant's default including, but not limited to Tenant's
failure to restore or clean the Premises following vacation thereof. If any
portion of the Security Deposit is so used or applied, Tenant shall, within ten
(10) days after written demand from Landlord, deposit cash with Landlord in an
amount sufficient to restore the Security Deposit to its full original amount,
and shall pay to Landlord such other sums as necessary to reimburse Landlord for
any sums paid by Landlord. If Tenant shall be in either monetary default or
material non-monetary default more than four (4) times in any twelve (12) month
period, then the Security Deposit shall, within ten (10) days after demand by
Landlord, be increased by Tenant to an amount equal to three (3) times the Base
Monthly Rent. Tenant may not assign or encumber the Security Deposit without the
consent of Landlord. Any attempt to do so shall be void and shall not be binding
on Landlord. The Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant within thirty (30)
days after the Expiration Date and surrender of the Premises to Landlord, less
any amount deducted in accordance with this Section, together with Landlord's
written notice itemizing the amounts and purposes for such deduction. In the
event of termination of Landlord's interest in this Lease, Landlord may deliver
or credit the Security Deposit to Landlord's successor in interest in the
Premises and thereupon be relieved of further responsibility with respect to the
Security Deposit.

Landlord agrees that in lieu of a cash Security Deposit, Tenant may deposit a
letter of credit ("Letter of Credit") substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit "B". Landlord shall be entitled to draw against the Letter of Credit
   -----------
at any time provided only that Landlord certifies to the issuer of the Letter of
Credit that Tenant is in default under the Lease. Tenant shall keep the letter
of credit in effect during the entire Lease Term, as the same may be extended,
plus a period of four (4) weeks after expiration of the Lease Term. At least
thirty (30) days prior to expiration of any Letter of Credit, the term thereof
shall be renewed or extended for a period of at least one (1) year. Tenant's
failure to so renew or extend the Letter of Credit shall be a material default
of this Lease by Tenant. In the event Landlord draws against the Letter of
Credit, Tenant shall replenish the existing Letter of Credit or cause a new
Letter of Credit to be

                                    Page 4
<PAGE>

issued such that the aggregate amount of letters of credit available to Landlord
at all times during the Lease Term is the amount of the Security Deposit
originally required.

5.   CONSTRUCTION:

     A. Building Shell Construction: Landlord shall cause the Building Shell (as
defined on the Building Shell Definition attached as Exhibit "C") and certain
                                                     -----------
Building Core Improvements (as defined below) to be constructed by Landlord's
affiliated construction company, Sobrato Construction Corporation ("General
Contractor") in accordance with Building Shell plans and guideline
specifications prepared by Arctec Associates ("Landlord's Architect") which
shall be attached by May 15, 2001 as Exhibit "D" ("Building Shell Plans and
                                     -----------
Specifications"), and which shall be generally consistent with the schematic
design drawings prepared by Landlord's Architect ("Preliminary Schematic Design
Drawings") and attached as Exhibit "E". The Building Shell Plans and
                           -----------
Specifications include certain elements of the Building core ("Building Core
Improvements") which is defined as those items typically associated in the
industry with an office building core including elevators, restrooms, fire
sprinklers, HVAC and electrical systems distributed to each floor, exiting stair
finishes, and a finished building lobby. Although certain Building Core
Improvements have been designed by Landlord's Architect and incorporated into
the Building Shell Plans and Specifications, it is understood and agreed that
Building Core Improvements are classified as part of Tenant Improvements and all
costs associated with the design and construction thereof shall be paid by
Tenant pursuant to Section 5.F. below. The Building Shell and Building Core
Improvements shall be constructed in a good and workmanlike fashion and in
compliance with all codes, laws, rules and regulations of applicable
governmental authority.

     B. Tenant Improvement Construction: Tenant, at Tenant's sole cost and
expense, shall retain an interior architect ("Tenant's Architect") to prepare
plans and outline specifications to be attached as Exhibit "F" ("Tenant
                                                   -----------
Improvement Plans and Specifications") with respect to the construction of the
balance of the improvements to the interior of the Premises ("Tenant
Improvements") necessary for Tenant's use and occupancy of the Building.
Landlord shall cause Tenant Improvements to be constructed by the General
Contractor in accordance with the Tenant Improvement Plans and Specifications.
The Tenant Improvement Plans and Specifications shall be completed for all
aspects of the work by July 31, 2001 with all detail necessary for submittal to
the city for issuance of building permits and for construction and shall include
any information required by the relevant agencies regarding Tenant's use of
Hazardous Materials if applicable. The Tenant Improvements shall consist of all
items not included within the scope of the Building Shell Definition, including
all Building Core Improvements. All Tenant Improvements shall be subject to
Landlord's approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. The Tenant Improvement Plans and Specifications shall provide for a
minimum build-out in all areas of the Premises consisting of: (i) fire
sprinklers, (ii) floor coverings, (iii) t-bar suspended ceiling (iv)
distribution of the HVAC system, (v) 2' x 4' drop-in florescent lighting, and
(vi) any other work required by the City of Mountain View necessary to obtain a
Certificate of Occupancy. Tenant shall not have the right to delay the
completion of the foregoing minimum Tenant Improvement build-out. The Tenant
Improvement Plans and Specifications shall be prepared in sufficient detail to
allow General Contractor to construct the Tenant Improvements. The Tenant
Improvements shall not be removed or altered by Tenant without the prior written
consent of Landlord as provided in Section 7 below. Tenant shall have the right
to depreciate and claim and collect any investment tax credits related to the
Tenant Improvements. Upon expiration of the Lease Term or any earlier
termination of the Lease, the Tenant Improvements shall become the property of
Landlord and shall remain upon and be surrendered with the Premises, and title
thereto shall automatically vest in Landlord without any payment therefore.

Landlord shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a building permit from
the City of Mountain View for the Tenant Improvements as soon as possible after
submittal of the Tenant Improvement Plans and Specifications, and thereafter to
cause the General Contractor to Substantially Complete the Tenant Improvements.
The Tenant Improvements shall be deemed substantially complete when the Tenant
Improvements have been substantially completed in accordance with the Tenant

                                    Page 5
<PAGE>

Improvement Plans and Specifications, as evidenced by the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy or its equivalent by the appropriate governmental
authority. Installation of Tenant's data and phone cabling, Tenant's furniture,
or the exterior landscaping shall not be required in order to deem the Tenant
Improvements Substantially Complete.

     C. Pricing: Within ten (10) days after completion of the Tenant
Improvements Plans and Specifications, Landlord shall cause the General
Contractor to submit to Tenant competitive bids from at least three (3)
subcontractors for each aspect of the work in excess of Fifty Thousand and
No/100 Dollars ($50,000.00) related to the Tenant Improvements. Landlord shall
cause the General Contractor to utilize the low bid in each case unless Tenant
approves General Contractor's use of another subcontractor, and the cost of the
Tenant Improvements shall be based upon construction expenses equal to (i) the
bid amounts as approved by Tenant, (ii) a five percent (5%) contingency to
protect the General Contractor against cost overruns, and (iii) the general
contractor fee specified in Section 5.H below ("Tenant Improvement Budget").
Upon Tenant's written approval of the Tenant Improvement Budget, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, Landlord and Tenant shall be
deemed to have given their respective approvals of the final Tenant Improvement
Plans and Specifications on which the cost estimate was made, and Tenant shall
cause the General Contractor to proceed with the construction of the Tenant
Improvements in accordance with the terms of Section 5.G below. If Tenant does
not specifically approve or disapprove the bids within seven (7) days, Tenant
shall be deemed to have approved the bids.

     D. Change Orders: With the exception of changes related to Building Core
Improvements, Tenant shall have the right to order changes in the manner and
type of construction of the Tenant Improvements subject to the reasonable
approval by Landlord. Upon request and prior to Tenant's submitting any binding
change order, Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to promptly provide
Tenant with written statements of the cost to implement and the time delay and
increased construction costs associated with any proposed change order, which
statements shall be binding on General Contractor. If no time delay or increased
construction cost amount is noted on the written statement, the parties agree
that there shall be no adjustment to the construction cost or the Commencement
Date associated with such change order. If ordered by Tenant, Landlord shall
cause the General Contractor to implement such change order and the cost of
constructing the Tenant Improvements shall be increased or decreased in
accordance with the cost statement previously delivered by General Contractor to
Tenant for any such change order.

     E. Building Shell Costs: Landlord shall pay all costs and expenses
associated with construction of the Building Shell. The Building Shell
Definition shall be the governing document in specifying the costs associated
with the Building Shell.

     F. Tenant Improvement Costs: Tenant shall pay all costs associated with the
Tenant Improvements (which includes Building Core Improvements) including, but
not limited to the following costs incurred by General Contractor in connection
with the construction of Tenant Improvements: construction costs, all permit
fees, construction taxes or other costs imposed by governmental authorities
related to the Tenant Improvements, and the General Contractor overhead as
described in Section 5.H below. During the course of construction of Tenant
Improvements, Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to deliver to Tenant
not more than once each calendar month a written request for payment ("Progress
Invoice") which shall include and be accompanied by General Contractor's
certified statements setting forth the amount requested, certifying the
percentage of completion of each item for which reimbursement is requested.
General Contractor shall use applicable standard AIA forms in such process.
Tenant shall pay directly to the General Contractor the amount due pursuant to
the Progress Invoice, within thirty (30) days after Tenant's receipt of the
above items. All costs for Tenant Improvements shall be fully documented to
Tenant and at Tenant's election, Tenant may verify such costs.

     G. Force Majeure: Any prevention, delay or stoppage due to strikes,
lockouts, inclement weather, labor disputes, inability to obtain labor,
materials, fuel or reasonable substitutes therefor, governmental restrictions,
regulations, controls, civil commotion, fire or other act of God, and another
causes beyond the reasonable control of Landlord (except financial inability)
shall extend

                                    Page 6
<PAGE>

the dates contained in this Section 5 by a period equal to the period of any
said prevention, delay or stoppage. If Landlord cannot obtain building permits
or substantially complete construction by the dates set forth herein, this Lease
shall not be void or voidable nor shall Landlord be liable for any loss or
damage resulting therefrom.

     H. General Contractor Overhead & Profit: As compensation to General
Contractor for its services related to construction of the Building Shell and
Tenant Improvements, General Contractor shall receive a fee of seven percent
(7%) of the cost of construction to cover all of the following: construction
supervision and administration, temporary on-site facilities, home office
administration, supervision, and coordination and construction profit. Except as
provided therein, Landlord or General Contractor shall not receive any other fee
or payment from Tenant in connection with General Contractor's services.

     I. Tenant Delays: A "Tenant Delay" shall mean any delay in substantial
completion of the Building as a result of any of the following: (i) Tenant's
failure to complete or approve the Tenant Improvement Plans by the dates set
forth in Section 5.B, (ii) Tenant's failure to approve the bids for construction
by the dates set forth in Section 5.C, (iii) changes to the plans requested by
Tenant which delay the progress of the work, (iv) Tenant's request for materials
components, or finishes which are not available in a commercially reasonable
time given the target Commencement Date, (v) Tenant's failure to make a progress
payment for Tenant Improvement costs as provided in Section 5.F, (vi) Tenant's
request for more than one (1) rebidding of the cost of all or a portion of the
work, and (vii) any errors or omissions in the Tenant Improvement Plans provided
by Tenant's architect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Lease, and regardless of the actual date the Premises are substantially
complete, the Commencement Date shall be deemed to be the date the Commencement
Date would have occurred if no Tenant Delay had occurred as reasonably
determined by Landlord. In addition, if a Tenant Delay results in an increase in
the cost of the labor or materials, Tenant shall pay the cost of such increases.

     J. Insurance: Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to procure (as a
cost of the Building Shell) a "Broad Form" liability insurance policy in the
amount of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000.00). Landlord shall also procure (as
a cost of the Building Shell) builder's risk insurance for the full replacement
cost of the Building Shell and Tenant Improvements while the Building and Tenant
Improvements are under construction, up until the date that the casualty
insurance policy described in Section 9 is in full force and effect.

     K. Punch List & Warranty: After the Building Shell and Tenant Improvements
are substantially complete, Landlord shall cause the General Contractor to
immediately correct any construction defect or other "punch list" item which
Tenant brings to General Contractor's attention. All such work shall be
performed so as to reasonably minimize the interruption to Tenant and its
activities on the Premises. General Contractor shall provide a standard
contractor's warranty with respect to the Building Shell and the Tenant
Improvements for one (1) year from the Commencement Date. Such warranty shall
exclude routine maintenance, damage caused by Tenant's negligence or misuse, and
acts of God.

     L. Other Work by Tenant: All work not described in the Shell Plans and
Specifications or Tenant Improvement Plans and Specifications, such as
furniture, telephone equipment, telephone wiring and office equipment work,
shall be furnished and installed by Tenant at Tenant' cost. Prior to substantial
completion, Tenant shall be obligated to (i) provide active phone lines to any
elevators, and (ii) contract with a firm to monitor the fire system. When the
construction of the Tenant Improvements has proceeded to the point where
Tenant's work of installing its fixtures and equipment in the Premises can be
commenced, General Contractor shall notify Tenant and shall permit Tenant and
its authorized representatives and contractors access to the Premises before the
Commencement Date for the purpose of installing Tenant's trade fixtures and
equipment. Any such installation work by Tenant or its authorized
representatives and contractor prior to the Commencement Date shall be
undertaken upon the following conditions: (i) the entry into the Premises by
Tenant or its representatives or contractors shall not interfere with or delay
General Contractor's work, and (ii) any contractor used by Tenant in connection
with such entry and installation shall use union labor.

     M. Landlord's Failure to Complete

                                    Page 7
<PAGE>

Construction: If the Building is not Substantially Complete in accordance with
the Building Shell Plans and Specifications and Tenant Improvements Plans and
Specifications by that date that is twenty-two (22) months from the date
Landlord has received all necessary governmental approvals to commence
construction of the Building Shell ("Deadline Date"), then Tenant, upon written
notice to Landlord, shall be entitled to complete construction of the Building
and offset the cost of construction for which Landlord is responsible under this
Lease, plus interest at the Agreed Interest Rate, against Tenant's obligation
for the Base Monthly Rent due under this Lease. The completion by Tenant of
Landlord's construction obligations as provided in this Section 5.N. shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of Tenant with respect to the failure by Landlord
to achieve Substantial Completion of the Building by the Deadline Date. In the
event that Tenant shall be required to complete Landlord's Work, Landlord agrees
to promptly assign to Tenant upon demand all plans and specifications relating
to construction for which Landlord is responsible under this Lease in order to
effectuate the completion thereof, and to cooperate with Tenant in connection
with the completion of such work. Nothing herein shall diminish Landlord's
obligation to act in good faith to promptly commence and diligently prosecute
the Landlord's Work.

The foregoing notwithstanding, the Deadline Date shall be extended one day for
every day of Force Majeure Delay or Tenant Delay as defined in Sections 5.G. and
5.I. above.

6.   ACCEPTANCE OF POSSESSION AND COVENANTS TO SURRENDER:

     A. Delivery and Acceptance: On the Commencement Date, Landlord shall
deliver and Tenant shall accept possession of the Premises. Tenant acknowledges
that it has had an opportunity to conduct, and has conducted, such inspections
of the Premises as it deems necessary to evaluate its condition. Except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, Tenant agrees to accept possession of
the Premises in its then existing condition, subject to all Restrictions and
without representation or warranty by Landlord.

     B. Condition Upon Surrender: Tenant further agrees on the Expiration Date
or on the sooner termination of this Lease, to surrender the Premises to
Landlord in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted. In this
regard, "normal wear and tear" shall be construed to mean wear and tear caused
to the Premises by the natural aging process which occurs in spite of prudent
application of the best standards for maintenance, repair replacement, and
janitorial practices, and does not include items of neglected or deferred
maintenance. In any event, Tenant shall cause the following to be done prior to
the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease: (i) all interior walls
shall be painted or cleaned so that they appear freshly painted, (ii) all tiled
floors shall be cleaned and waxed, (iii) all carpets shall be cleaned and
shampooed, (iv) all broken, marred, stained or nonconforming acoustical ceiling
tiles shall be replaced, (v) all cabling placed above the ceiling by Tenant or
Tenant's contractors shall be removed unless such cabling has been placed in
trays especially designed for such purpose and is not weighing directly on the
ceiling, (vi) all windows shall be washed; (vii) the HVAC system shall be
serviced by a reputable and licensed service firm and left in "good operating
condition and repair" as evidenced by a report by such firm, (viii) the plumbing
and electrical systems and lighting shall be placed in good order and repair
(including replacement of any burned out, discolored or broken light bulbs,
ballasts, or lenses. On or before the Expiration Date or sooner termination of
this Lease, Tenant shall remove all its personal property and trade fixtures
from the Premises. All property and fixtures not so removed shall be deemed as
abandoned by Tenant. At the expiration of the Lease Term, Landlord shall not
have the right to require that Tenant remove from the Premises any Alterations
(as defined in Section 7 below) made with Landlord's consent unless Landlord, at
the time of granting such consent, indicates that the subject Alteration must be
removed upon the expiration of the Lease Term. With respect to Permitted
Alterations as defined in Section 7A. below, Tenant shall ascertain from
Landlord within ninety (90) days before the Expiration Date whether Landlord
desires to have such Permitted Alterations removed. If Landlord so elects,
Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove such Alterations as Landlord
has required and shall repair and restore the affected areas of the Premises
prior to the Expiration Date to a standard open office plan with materials and
finishes consistent with the other open office areas within the Premises. Such
repair and restoration shall include

                                    Page 8
<PAGE>

causing the Premises to be brought into compliance with all applicable building
codes and laws in effect at the time of the removal to the extent such
compliance is necessitated by the repair and restoration work.

     C. Failure to Surrender: If the Premises are not surrendered at the
Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease in the condition required by
this Section 6, Tenant shall be deemed in a holdover tenancy pursuant to this
Section 6.D. and Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold Landlord harmless
against loss or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the
Premises including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding tenant
founded on such delay and costs incurred by Landlord in returning the Premises
to the required condition, plus interest at the Agreed Interest Rate. Any
holding over after the termination or Expiration Date with Landlord's express
written consent, shall be construed as month-to-month tenancy, terminable on
thirty (30) days written notice from either party, and Tenant shall pay as Base
Monthly Rent to Landlord a rate equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%)
of the Base Monthly Rent due in the month preceding the termination or
Expiration Date, plus all other amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease. Any
holding over shall otherwise be on the terms and conditions herein specified,
except those provisions relating to the Lease Term and any options to extend or
renew, which provisions shall be of no further force and effect following the
expiration of the applicable exercise period. If Tenant remains in possession of
the Premises after the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease
without Landlord's consent, Tenant's continued possession shall be on the basis
of a tenancy at sufferance and Tenant shall pay as rent during the holdover
period an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Monthly
Rent due in the month preceding the termination or Expiration Date, plus all
other amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease. This provision shall survive
the termination or expiration of the Lease.

7.   ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS:

     A. Tenant's Alterations: Tenant shall not make, or suffer to be made, any
alteration or addition to the Premises ("Alterations"), or any part thereof,
without obtaining Landlord's prior written consent and delivering to Landlord
the proposed architectural and structural plans for all such Alterations at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the start of construction. If such Alterations
affect the structure of the Building, Tenant additionally agrees to reimburse
Landlord its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in reviewing Tenant's
plans. After obtaining Landlord's consent, which consent shall state whether or
not Landlord will require Tenant to remove such Alteration at the expiration or
earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall not proceed to make such
Alterations until Tenant has obtained all required governmental approvals and
permits. Tenant agrees to provide Landlord (i) written notice of the anticipated
and actual start-date of the work, (ii) a complete set of half-size (15" X 21")
vellum as-built drawings, and (iii) a certificate of occupancy for the work upon
completion of the Alterations. All Alterations shall be constructed in
compliance with all applicable building codes and laws including, without
limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended from time to
time. Upon the Expiration Date, all Alterations, except movable furniture and
trade fixtures, shall become a part of the realty and belong to Landlord but
shall nevertheless be subject to removal by Tenant as provided in Section 6
above. Alterations which are not deemed as trade fixtures include heating,
lighting, electrical systems, air conditioning, walls, carpeting, or any other
installation which has become an integral part of the Premises (excepting backup
power generators or a UPS system, which Tenant shall have the right to remove).
All Alterations shall be maintained, replaced or repaired by Tenant at its sole
cost and expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled, without obtaining
Landlord's consent, to make Alterations which do not affect the structure of the
Building and which do not cost more than Seventy Thousand Dollars ($70,000.00)
per Alteration ("Permitted Alterations"); provided, however, that: (i) Tenant
shall still be required to comply with all other provisions of this paragraph;
and (ii) such Permitted Alterations are subject to removal by Tenant at
Landlord's election pursuant to Section 6.C. above at the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease.

     B. Free From Liens: Tenant shall keep the Premises free from all liens
arising out of work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by
Tenant or claimed to have been performed for Tenant. In the event

                                    Page 9
<PAGE>

Tenant fails to discharge any such lien within sixty (60) days after receiving
notice of the filing, Landlord shall be entitled to discharge the lien at
Tenant's expense and all resulting costs incurred by Landlord, including
attorney's fees shall be due from Tenant as additional rent.

     C. Compliance With Governmental Regulations: The term Laws or Governmental
Regulations shall include all federal, state, county, city or governmental
agency laws, statutes, ordinances, standards, rules, requirements, or orders now
in force or hereafter enacted, promulgated, or issued. The term also includes
government measures regulating or enforcing public access, traffic mitigation,
occupational, health, or safety standards for employers, employees, landlords,
or tenants. Tenant, at Tenant's sole expense shall make all repairs,
replacements, alterations, or improvements needed to comply with all
Governmental Regulations. The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction or
the admission of Tenant in any action or proceeding against Tenant (whether
Landlord be a party thereto or not) that Tenant has violated any such law,
regulation or other requirement in its use of the Premises shall be conclusive
of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant.

The foregoing notwithstanding, if any repair, replacement, alteration or
improvement is required to the Building foundation, exterior load bearing walls,
roof structure or any other structural component of the Building (excluding
structural components installed by Tenant) as a result of any Governmental
Regulations and such required work is not caused by Tenant's specific use or
Alterations, the cost of such repair, replacement, alteration or improvement
shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant such that Tenant shall pay to
Landlord upon completion of such work, the portion of the cost equal to the
product of such cost multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of years remaining in the Lease Term, the denominator of which is the
useful life (in years) of the repair, replacement, alteration or addition;
provided, however, that if the Tenant thereafter exercises a renewal option,
then upon Tenant's exercise of the renewal option, the numerator of the fraction
shall be adjusted to the sum of: (i) the Lease Term remaining at the time the
repair, replacement, alteration or addition was made; and (ii) the number of
years in the Option Term; and Landlord's reimbursement obligation shall
immediately thereafter be re-calculated.

8.   MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES:

     A. Landlord's Obligations: Landlord at its sole cost and expense, shall
maintain in good condition, order, and repair, and replace as and when
necessary, the foundation, exterior load bearing walls and roof structure, and
all other structural components of the Building, excluding any components
installed by Tenant.

     B. Tenant's Obligations: Tenant shall clean, maintain, repair and replace
when necessary the Premises and every part thereof through regular inspections
and servicing, including but not limited to: (i) all plumbing and sewage
facilities, (ii) all heating ventilating and air conditioning facilities and
equipment, (iii) all fixtures, interior walls floors, carpets and ceilings, (iv)
all windows, door entrances, plate glass and glazing systems including caulking
& skylights, (v) all electrical facilities & equipment, (vi) all automatic fire
extinguisher equipment, (vii) the parking lot and all underground utility
facilities servicing the Premises, (viii) all elevator equipment, (ix) the roof
membrane system, and (x) all waterscape, landscaping and shrubbery. All wall
surfaces and floor tile are to be maintained in an as good a condition as when
Tenant took possession free of holes, gouges, or defacements. With respect to
items (ii), (viii) and (ix) above, Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of a
service contract between Tenant and a licensed service contractor providing for
periodic maintenance of all such systems or equipment in conformance with the
manufacturer's recommendations. Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of such
preventive maintenance contracts and paid invoices for the recommended work if
requested by Landlord.

If as a part of Tenant's fulfillment of its maintenance obligations during the
last three (3) years of the Lease Term a replacement of the roof membrane is
necessary, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of the replacement less
the sum of (i) Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) plus (ii) that portion of
the cost over $30,000.00 equal to the product of such cost multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years remaining in the Lease
Term, the denominator of which is the useful life (in years) of the roof
replacement; provided, however, that if the roof replacement is made during the
initial Lease Term and Tenant thereafter exercises a renewal option, then upon
Tenant's exercise of the renewal option, the

                                    Page 10
<PAGE>

numerator of the fraction shall be adjusted to the sum of: (i) the Lease Term
remaining at the time the roof replacement was made; and (ii) the number of
years in the Option Term; and Landlord's reimbursement obligation shall
immediately thereafter be re-calculated.

     C. Common Area Cost Sharing: Pursuant to Tenant's maintenance obligations
under this Lease, Tenant is solely responsible for the Common Area so long as it
is leasing all buildings within the Project. In the event Tenant does not lease
all buildings within the Project, Tenant shall remain obligated for such
expenses; however, the Lease shall be amended to provide for Landlord's
management of the Common Area and reimbursement by Tenant of only its pro rata
share, such share to be calculated based on leased square footage within the
Project.

     D. Waiver of Liability: Failure by Landlord to perform any defined
services, or any cessation thereof, when such failure is caused by accident,
breakage, repairs, strikes, lockout or other labor disturbances or labor
disputes of any character or by any other cause, similar or dissimilar, shall
not render Landlord liable to Tenant in any respect, including damages to either
person or property, except to the extent due to Landlord's active negligence or
willful misconduct, nor be construed as an eviction of Tenant, nor cause an
abatement of rent, nor relieve Tenant from fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement hereof. Should any equipment or machinery utilized in supplying the
services listed herein break down or for any cause cease to function properly,
upon receipt of written notice from Tenant of any deficiency or failure of any
services, Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to repair the same promptly,
but Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease and shall have no claim
for rebate of rent or damages on account of any interruptions in service
occasioned thereby or resulting therefrom, except to the extent due to
Landlord's active negligence or willful misconduct. Tenant waives the provisions
of California Civil Code Sections 1941 and 1942 concerning the Landlord's
obligation of tenantability and Tenant's right to make repairs and deduct the
cost of such repairs from the rent. Landlord shall not be liable for a loss of
or injury to person or property, however occurring, through or in connection
with or incidental to furnishing, or its failure to furnish, any of the
foregoing.

9.   HAZARD INSURANCE:

     A. Tenant's Use: Tenant shall not use or permit the Premises, or any part
thereof, to be used for any purpose other than that for which the Premises are
hereby leased; and no use of the Premises shall be made or permitted, nor acts
done, which will cause an increase in premiums or a cancellation of any
insurance policy covering the Premises or any part thereof, nor shall Tenant
sell or permit to be sold, kept, or used in or about the Premises, any article
prohibited by the standard form of fire insurance policies. Tenant shall, at its
sole cost, comply with all requirements of any insurance company or organization
necessary for the maintenance of reasonable fire and public liability insurance
covering the Premises and appurtenances.

     B. Landlord's Insurance: Landlord agrees to purchase and keep in force
fire, extended coverage insurance in an amount equal to the replacement cost of
the Building (not including any Tenant Improvements or Alterations paid for by
Tenant) as determined by Landlord's insurance company's appraisers. At
Landlord's election, such fire and property damage insurance may be endorsed to
cover loss caused by such additional perils against which Landlord may elect to
insure, including earthquake and/or flood, and shall contain reasonable
deductibles. Additionally Landlord may maintain a policy of (i) commercial
general liability insurance insuring Landlord (and such others designated by
Landlord) against liability for personal injury, bodily injury, death and damage
to property occurring or resulting from an occurrence in, on or about the
Premises or Project in an amount as Landlord determines is reasonably necessary
for its protection, and (ii) rental loss insurance covering a twelve (12) month
period. Tenant agrees to pay Landlord as additional rent, on demand, the full
cost of said insurance as evidenced by insurance billings to Landlord, and in
the event of damage covered by said insurance, the amount of any deductible
under such policy. Payment shall be due to Landlord within ten (10) days after
written invoice to Tenant. It is understood and agreed that Tenant's obligation
under this Section will be prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and
Expiration Dates.

     C. Tenant's Insurance: Tenant agrees, at its sole cost, to insure its
personal property, Tenant Improvements, and Alterations for their

                                    Page 11
<PAGE>

full replacement value (without depreciation) and to obtain worker's
compensation and public liability and property damage insurance for occurrences
within the Premises with a combined single limit of not less than Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000.00). Tenant's liability insurance shall be primary insurance
containing a cross-liability endorsement, and shall provide coverage on an
"occurrence" rather than on a "claims made" basis. Tenant shall name Landlord
and Landlord's lender as an additional insured and shall deliver a copy of the
policies and renewal certificates to Landlord. All such policies shall provide
for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord of any cancellation,
termination, or reduction in coverage.

     D.   Waiver: Landlord and Tenant hereby waive all rights each may have
against the other on account of any loss or damage sustained by Landlord or
Tenant, as the case may be, or to the Premises or its contents, which may arise
from any risk covered by their respective insurance policies (or which would
have been covered had such insurance policies been maintained in accordance with
this Lease) as set forth above. The Parties shall use their reasonable efforts
to obtain from their respective insurance companies a waiver of any right of
subrogation which said insurance company may have against Landlord or Tenant, as
the case may be.

10.  Taxes: Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay as additional rental, prior
to delinquency, the following: (i) all taxes and assessments levied against
Tenant's personal property and trade or business fixtures; (ii) all real estate
taxes and assessment installments or other impositions or charges which may be
levied on the Premises or upon the occupancy of the Premises, including any
substitute or additional charges which may be imposed applicable to the Lease
Term; and (iii) real estate tax increases due to an increase in assessed value
resulting from a sale, transfer or other change of ownership of the Premises as
it appears on the City and County tax bills during the Lease Term. All real
estate taxes shall be prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and Expiration
Dates. If, at any time during the Lease Term a tax, excise on rents, business
license tax or any other tax, however described, is levied or assessed against
Landlord as a substitute or addition, in whole or in part, for taxes assessed or
imposed on land or Buildings, Tenant shall pay and discharge its pro rata share
of such tax or excise on rents or other tax before it becomes delinquent; except
that this provision is not intended to cover net income taxes, inheritance, gift
or estate tax imposed upon Landlord. In the event that a tax is placed, levied,
or assessed against Landlord and the taxing authority takes the position that
Tenant cannot pay and discharge its pro rata share of such tax on behalf of
Landlord, then Landlord may increase the Base Monthly Rent by the exact amount
of such tax and Tenant shall pay such increase. If by virtue of any application
or proceeding brought by Landlord, there results a reduction in the assessed
value of the Premises during the Lease Term, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord a fee
consistent with the fees charged by a third party appeal firm for such services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if property taxes increase during the first three
years of the Lease Term as a result of a reassessment due to a voluntary change
of ownership, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of the resulting property
tax increase as follows: during the first twelve months, Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of thirty three percent (33%) of the tax increase;
during the second twelve months, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of
sixty seven percent (67%) of the tax increase, thereafter Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of the entire tax increase.

11.  Utilities: Tenant shall pay directly to the providing utility all water,
gas, electric, telephone, and other utilities supplied to the Premises. Landlord
shall not be liable for loss of or injury to person or property, however
occurring, through or in connection with or incidental to furnishing or the
utility company's failure to furnish utilities to the Premises, and in such
event Tenant shall not be entitled to abatement or reduction of any portion of
Base Monthly Rent or any other amount payable under this Lease.

12.  Toxic Waste and Environmental Damage:

     A.   Tenant's Responsibility: Without the prior written consent of
Landlord, Tenant or Tenant's agents, employees, contractors and invitees
("Tenant's Agents") shall not bring, use, or permit upon the Premises, or
generate, create, release, emit, or dispose (nor permit any of the same) from
the Premises any chemicals, toxic or hazardous gaseous, liquid or solid
materials or waste, including without limitation, material or substance having
characteristics of ignitability,

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>

corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity or substances or materials which are listed
on any of the Environmental Protection Agency's lists of hazardous wastes or
which are identified in Division 22 Title 26 of the California Code of
Regulations as the same may be amended from time to time or any other similar
wastes, materials or substances which are or may become regulated by or under
the authority of any applicable local, state or federal laws, judgments,
ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, codes or other governmental
restrictions, guidelines or requirements ("Hazardous Materials") except for
those substances customary in typical office uses for which no consent shall be
required. In order to obtain consent, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord its
written proposal describing the toxic material to be brought onto the Premises,
measures to be taken for storage and disposal thereof, safety measures to be
employed to prevent pollution of the air, ground, surface and ground water.
Landlord's approval may be withheld in its reasonable judgment. In the event
Landlord consents to Tenant's use of Hazardous Materials on the Premises or such
consent is not required, Tenant represents and warrants that it shall comply
with all Governmental Regulations applicable to Hazardous Materials including
doing the following: (i) adhere to all reporting and inspection requirements
imposed by Federal, State, County or Municipal laws, ordinances or regulations
and will provide Landlord a copy of any such reports or agency inspections; (ii)
obtain and provide Landlord copies of all necessary permits required for the use
and handling of Hazardous Materials on the Premises; (iii) enforce Hazardous
Materials handling and disposal practices consistent with industry standards;
(iv) surrender the Premises free from any Hazardous Materials arising from
Tenant's bringing, using, permitting, generating, creating, releasing, emitting
or disposing of Hazardous Materials; and (v) properly close the facility with
regard to Hazardous Materials including the removal or decontamination of any
process piping, mechanical ducting, storage tanks, containers, or trenches which
have come into contact with Hazardous Materials and obtain a closure certificate
from the local administering agency prior to the Expiration Date. Landlord
acknowledges and consents to the storage on the Premises by Tenant of diesel
fuel for Tenant's emergency generators, such storage to be in above-ground tanks
reasonably approved by Landlord.

     B.   Tenant's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials: Tenant shall, at its
sole cost and expense, comply with all laws pertaining to, and shall with
counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Landlord and Landlord's trustees, shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
partners, affiliates, and agents from, any claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses incurred or suffered arising from the bringing, using, permitting,
generating, emitting or disposing of Hazardous Materials by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents through the surface soils of the Premises during the Lease Term or the
violation of any Governmental Regulation or environmental law, by Tenant or
Tenant's Agents. Tenant's foregoing indemnification, defense, and hold harmless
obligations include, without limitation, the following: (i) claims, liability,
costs or expenses resulting from or based upon administrative, judicial (civil
or criminal) or other action, legal or equitable, brought by any private or
public person under common law or under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended ("CERCLA"), the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1980 ("RCRA") or any other federal,
state, county or municipal law, ordinance or regulation now or hereafter in
effect; (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or expenses pertaining to the
identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or removal of Hazardous
Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the provision of an
alternative public drinking water source; (iii) all costs of defending such
claims; (iv) losses attributable to diminution in the value of the Premises or
the Building; (v) loss or restriction of use of rentable space in the Building;
(vi) adverse effect on the marketing of any space in the Building; and (vi) all
other liabilities, obligations, penalties, fines, claims, actions (including
remedial or enforcement actions of any kind and administrative or judicial
proceedings, orders or judgments), damages (including consequential and punitive
damages), and costs (including attorney, consultant, and expert fees and
expenses) resulting from the release or violation. This Section 12.B shall
survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.

     C.   Actual Release by Tenant: Tenant agrees to notify Landlord of any
lawsuits or orders which relate to the remedying of or actual release of
Hazardous Materials on or into the soils or ground water at or under the


                                    Page 13
<PAGE>

Premises. Tenant shall also provide Landlord all notices required by Section
25359.7(b) of the Health and Safety Code and all other notices required by law
to be given to Landlord in connection with Hazardous Materials. Without limiting
the foregoing, Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord, within twenty (20) days
after receipt thereof, any written notices from any governmental agency alleging
a material violation of, or material failure to comply with, any federal, state
or local laws, regulations, ordinances or orders, the violation of which or
failure to comply with poses a foreseeable and material risk of contamination of
the ground water or injury to humans (other than injury solely to Tenant or
Tenant's Agents).

     In the event of any release on or into the Premises or into the soil or
ground water under the Premises, the Building or the Project of any Hazardous
Materials used, treated, stored or disposed of by Tenant or Tenant's Agents,
Tenant agrees to comply, at its sole cost, with all laws, regulations,
ordinances and orders of any federal, state or local agency relating to the
monitoring or remediation of such Hazardous Materials. In the event of any such
release of Hazardous Materials Tenant shall immediately give verbal and
follow-up written notice of the release to Landlord, and Tenant agrees to meet
and confer with Landlord and its Lender to attempt to eliminate and mitigate any
financial exposure to such Lender and resultant exposure to Landlord under
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 736(b) as a result of such release,
and promptly to take reasonable monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps given,
inter alia, the historical uses to which the Property has and continues to be
used, the risks to public health posed by the release, the then available
technology and the costs of remediation, cleanup and monitoring, consistent with
acceptable customary practices for the type and severity of such contamination
and all applicable laws. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall eliminate,
modify or reduce the obligation of Tenant under 12.B of this Lease to indemnify,
defend and hold Landlord harmless from any claims liabilities, costs or expenses
incurred or suffered by Landlord. Tenant shall provide Landlord prompt written
notice of Tenant's monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps.

     In the absence of an order of any federal, state or local governmental or
quasi-governmental agency relating to the cleanup, remediation or other response
action required by applicable law, any dispute arising between Landlord and
Tenant concerning Tenant's obligation to Landlord under this Section 12.C
concerning the level, method, and manner of cleanup, remediation or response
action required in connection with such a release of Hazardous Materials shall
be resolved by mediation and/or arbitration pursuant to this Lease.

     D.   Environmental Monitoring: Landlord and its agents shall have the right
to inspect, investigate, sample and monitor the Premises including any air,
soil, water, ground water or other sampling or any other testing, digging,
drilling or analysis to determine whether Tenant is complying with the terms of
this Section 12. If Landlord discovers that Tenant is not in compliance with the
terms of this Section 12, any such costs incurred by Landlord, including
attorneys' and consultants' fees, shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord
within thirty (30) days following Landlord's written demand therefore.

     E.   Landlord's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials: Landlord shall, at
its sole cost and expense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant,
indemnify, defend, and hold Tenant harmless from any claims, liabilities, costs
or expenses incurred or suffered by Tenant related to the release, existence,
removal, investigation, monitoring or remediation of Hazardous Materials which
are present or which come to be present on or beneath the Premises except to the
extent the presence of such Hazardous Materials is caused by Tenant or Tenant's
agents. Landlord's indemnification and hold harmless obligations include,
without limitation, (i) claims, liability, costs or expenses resulting from or
based upon administrative, judicial (civil or criminal) or other action, legal
or equitable, brought by any private or public person under common law or
CERCLA, RCRA, or any other federal, state, county or municipal law, ordinance or
regulation now or hereinafter in effect, (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses pertaining to the identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or
removal of Hazardous Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the
provision of an alternative public drinking water source, and (iii) all costs of
defending such claims. In no event shall Landlord be liable for any
consequential damages suffered or incurred by Tenant as a result of any such

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>

contamination.

13.  Tenant's Default: The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a
default and breach of this Lease by Tenant: (i) Tenant's failure to pay the Base
Monthly Rent including additional rent or any other payment due under this Lease
within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of written notice from
Landlord that such Base Monthly Rent or other payment was not received when due,
(ii) the abandonment of the Premises by Tenant; (iii) Tenant's failure to
observe and perform any other required provision of this Lease, where such
failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice from Landlord;
provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such that it cannot
reasonably be cured within the 30-day period, Tenant shall not be deemed in
default if it commences within such period to cure, and thereafter diligently
prosecutes the same to completion; (iv) Tenant's making of any general
assignment for the benefit of creditors; (v) the filing by or against Tenant of
a petition to have Tenant adjudged a bankrupt or of a petition for
reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to bankruptcy (unless, in
the case of a petition filed against Tenant, the same is dismissed within sixty
(60) days after the filing); (vi) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to
take possession of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises
or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to
Tenant within sixty (60) days; or (vii) the attachment, execution or other
judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises
or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged
within sixty (60) days.

     A.   Remedies: In the event of any such default by Tenant, then in addition
to other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, Landlord shall have
the immediate option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder
by giving written notice of such intention to terminate. In the event Landlord
elects to so terminate this Lease, Landlord may recover from Tenant all the
following: (i) the worth at time of award of any unpaid rent which had been
earned at the time of such termination; (ii) the worth at time of award of the
amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination
until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss for the same
period that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at
time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the
Lease Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; (iv) any other amount necessary to
compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to
perform its obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of
things would be likely to result therefrom; including the following: (x)
expenses for repairing, altering or remodeling the Premises for purposes of
reletting, (y) broker's fees, advertising costs or other expenses of reletting
the Premises, and (z) costs of carrying the Premises such as taxes, insurance
premiums, utilities and security precautions; and (v) at Landlord's election,
such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be
permitted by applicable California law. The term "rent", as used herein, is
defined as the minimum monthly installments of Base Monthly Rent and all other
sums required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, all such other sums
being deemed as additional rent due hereunder. As used in (i) and (ii) above,
"worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at a rate
equal to the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco plus
five (5%) percent per annum. As used in (iii) above, "worth at the time of
award" shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one (1%)
percent.

     B.   Right to Re-enter: In the event of any such default by Tenant,
Landlord shall have the right, after terminating this Lease, to re-enter the
Premises and remove all persons and property. Such property may be removed and
stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of
Tenant, and disposed of by Landlord in any manner permitted by law.

     C.   Abandonment: If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as
provided in Section 13.A or 13.B above, then the provisions of California Civil
Code Section 1951.4, (Landlord may continue the lease in effect after Tenant's
breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due if Tenant has a right
to sublet and assign, subject only to reasonable limitations) as amended from
time to time, shall apply and Landlord may from time to time, without
terminating this Lease, either recover all rental as it becomes due or relet the
Premises or

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>

any part thereof for such term or terms and at such rental or rentals and upon
such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its reasonable discretion may
deem advisable, with the right to make alterations and repairs to the Premises.
In the event that Landlord elects to so relet, rentals received by Landlord from
such reletting shall be applied in the following order to: (i) the payment of
any indebtedness other than Base Monthly Rent due hereunder from Tenant to
Landlord; (ii) the payment of any cost of such reletting; (iii) the payment of
the cost of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; and (iv) the payment of
Base Monthly Rent due and unpaid hereunder. The residual rentals, if any, shall
be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Base Monthly Rent as the
same may become due and payable hereunder. Landlord shall have the obligation to
market the space but shall have no obligation to relet the Premises following a
default if Landlord has other comparable available space within the Building or
Project. In the event the portion of rentals received from such reletting which
is applied to the payment of rent hereunder during any month be less than the
rent payable during that month by Tenant hereunder, then Tenant shall pay such
deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand. Such deficiency shall be
calculated and paid monthly. Tenant shall also pay to Landlord, as soon as
ascertained, any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in such reletting or in
making such alterations and repairs not covered by the rentals received from
such reletting.

     D.   No Termination: Landlord's re-entry or taking possession of the
Premises pursuant to 13.B or 13.C shall not be construed as an election to
terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention is given to Tenant
or unless the termination is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any reletting without termination by Landlord because of any
default by Tenant, Landlord may at any time after such reletting elect to
terminate this Lease for any such default.

     E.   Non-Waiver: Landlord may accept Tenant's payments without waiving any
rights under this Lease, including rights under a previously served notice of
default. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than any
installment of rent due shall be deemed as other than payment on account of the
amount due. If Landlord accepts payments after serving a notice of default,
Landlord may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and
remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Tenant any
further notice or demand. Furthermore, the Landlord's acceptance of rent from
the Tenant when the Tenant is holding over without express written consent does
not convert Tenant's Tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month to month
tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Lease shall be implied by any
failure of Landlord to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision,
even if that violation continues or is repeated. Any waiver by Landlord of any
provision of this Lease must be in writing. Such waiver shall affect only the
provision specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the
writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Landlord
shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof by
Landlord. No act or conduct of Landlord, including, without limitation, the
acceptance of keys to the Premises, shall constitute acceptance of the surrender
of the Premises by Tenant before the Expiration Date. Only written notice from
Landlord to Tenant of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance of surrender
of the Premises. Landlord's consent to or approval of any act by Tenant which
requires Landlord's consent or approvals shall not be deemed to waive or render
unnecessary Landlord's consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Tenant.

     F.   Performance by Landlord: If Tenant fails to perform any obligation
required under this Lease or by law or governmental regulation, Landlord in its
sole discretion may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to Tenant, without
waiving any rights or remedies and without releasing Tenant from its obligations
hereunder, perform such obligation, in which event Tenant shall pay Landlord as
additional rent all sums paid by Landlord in connection with such substitute
performance, including interest at the Agreed Interest Rate (as defined in
Section 19.J) within ten (10) days of Landlord's written notice for such
payment.

     G.   Habitual Default: The provisions of Section 13 notwithstanding, the
Parties agree that if Tenant has been in either monetary default or material
non-monetary default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) in the
performance of any (but not necessarily the same) term or condition of this
Lease for four or more times during any twelve (12) month period during the
Lease Term, then such
<PAGE>

conduct shall, at the election of the Landlord, represent a separate event of
default which cannot be cured by Tenant. Tenant acknowledges that the purpose of
this provision is to prevent repetitive defaults by Tenant, which work a
hardship upon Landlord and deprive Landlord of Tenant's timely performance under
this Lease.

14.  Landlord's Liability:

     A.   Limitation on Landlord's Liability: In the event of Landlord's failure
to perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Lease, Tenant shall
give Landlord written notice of such failure and shall give Landlord thirty (30)
days to cure or commence to cure such failure prior to any claim for breach or
resultant damages, provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such
that it cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-day period, Landlord shall not
be deemed in default if it commences within such period to cure, and thereafter
diligently prosecutes the same to completion. In addition, upon any such failure
by Landlord, Tenant shall give notice by registered or certified mail to any
person or entity with a security interest in the Premises ("Mortgagee") that has
provided Tenant with notice of its interest in the Premises, and shall provide
Mortgagee a reasonable opportunity to cure such failure, including such time to
obtain possession of the Premises by power of sale or judicial foreclosure, if
such should prove necessary to effectuate a cure. Tenant agrees that each of the
Mortgagees to whom this Lease has been assigned is an expressed third-party
beneficiary hereof. Tenant waives any right under California Civil Code Section
1950.7 or any other present or future law to the collection of any payment or
deposit from Mortgagee or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale of Mortgagee's
interest unless Mortgagee or such purchaser shall have actually received and not
refunded the applicable payment or deposit. Tenant further waives any right to
terminate this Lease and to vacate the Premises on Landlord's default under this
Lease, except in the event of a constructive eviction under law. Tenant's sole
remedy on Landlord's default is an action for damages or injunctive or
declaratory relief.

     B.   Limitation on Tenant's Recourse: If Landlord is a corporation, trust,
partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association or other form of business
entity, then (i) the obligations of Landlord shall not constitute personal
obligations of the officers, directors, trustees, partners, joint venturers,
members, owners, stockholders, or other principals or representatives except to
the extent of their interest in the Premises. Tenant shall have recourse only to
the interest of Landlord in the Premises or for the satisfaction of the
obligations of Landlord and shall not have recourse to any other assets of
Landlord for the satisfaction of such obligations.

     C.   Indemnification of Landlord: As a material part of the consideration
rendered to Landlord, Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord for
damages to goods, wares and merchandise, and all other personal property in,
upon or about said Premises and for injuries to persons in or about said
Premises, from any cause arising at any time to the fullest extent permitted by
law, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence
of Landlord, and Tenant shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably
acceptable to Landlord and hold Landlord, and their shareholders, directors,
officers, trustees, employees, partners, affiliates and agents from any claims,
liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or suffered arising from the use of
occupancy of the Premises or any part of the Project by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents, the acts or omissions of Tenant or Tenant's Agents, Tenant's breach of
this Lease, or any damage or injury to person or property from any cause, except
to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence of Landlord
or from the failure of Tenant to keep the Premises in good condition and repair
as herein provided, except to the extent due to the active negligence or willful
misconduct of Landlord. Further, in the event Landlord is made party to any
litigation due to the acts or omission of Tenant and Tenant's Agents, Tenant
will indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold
Landlord harmless from any such claim or liability including Landlord's costs
and expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in defending such claims.

15.  Destruction of Premises:

     A.   Landlord's Obligation to Restore: In the event of a destruction of the
Premises during the Lease Term Landlord shall repair the same to a similar
condition to that which existed prior to such destruction. Such destruction
shall not annul or void this Lease; however, Tenant shall be entitled to a
proportionate reduction of Base

                                    Page 17
<PAGE>

Monthly Rent while repairs are being made, such proportionate reduction to be
based upon the extent to which the repairs interfere with Tenant's business in
the Premises, as reasonably determined by Landlord. In no event shall Landlord
be required to replace or restore Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or Tenant's
fixtures or personal property. With respect to a destruction which Landlord is
obligated to repair or may elect to repair under the terms of this Section,
Tenant waives the provisions of Section 1932, and Section 1933, Subdivision 4,
of the Civil Code of the State of California, and any other similarly enacted
statute, and the provisions of this Section 15 shall govern in the case of such
destruction.

     B.   Limitations on Landlord's Restoration Obligation: Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 15.A, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair, or
restore the Premises if any of the following occur: (i) if the repairs cannot be
made within two hundred seventy (270) days from the date of receipt of all
governmental approvals necessary under the laws and regulations of State,
Federal, County or Municipal authorities, as reasonably determined by Landlord,
(ii) if the holder of the first deed of trust or mortgage encumbering the
Building elects not to permit the insurance proceeds payable upon damage or
destruction to be used for such repair or restoration, (iii) the damage or
destruction is not fully covered by the insurance (plus any deductible amount)
maintained by Landlord, (iv) the damage or destruction occurs in the last twenty
four (24) months of the Lease Term, (v) Tenant is in default pursuant to the
provisions of Section 13, or (vi) Tenant has vacated the Premises for more than
the immediately preceding one hundred twenty (120) days. In any such event
Landlord may elect either to complete the repair or restoration, or terminate
this Lease by providing Tenant written notice of its election within sixty (60)
days following the damage or destruction. Tenant shall also have a right to
terminate this Lease if the repairs cannot be made within two hundred seventy
(270) days from the date of receipt of all governmental approvals necessary
under the laws and regulations of State, Federal, County or Municipal
authorities, by providing Landlord written notice of its election within sixty
(60) days following the damage or destruction.

16.  Condemnation: If any part of the Premises shall be taken for any public or
quasi-public use, under any statute or by right of eminent domain or private
purchase in lieu thereof, and only a part thereof remains which is susceptible
of occupation hereunder as reasonably determined by Tenant, this Lease shall, as
to the part so taken, terminate as of the day before title vests in the
condemnor or purchaser ("Vesting Date") and Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder
shall be adjusted so that Tenant is required to pay for the remainder of the
Lease Term only such portion of Base Monthly Rent as the value of the part
remaining after such taking bears to the value of the entire Premises prior to
such taking. If all of the Premises or such part thereof be taken so that there
does not remain a portion susceptible for occupation hereunder as reasonably
determined by Tenant, this Lease shall terminate on the Vesting Date. If part or
all of the Premises be taken, all compensation awarded upon such taking shall go
to Landlord, and Tenant shall have no claim thereto; except Landlord shall
cooperate with Tenant, without cost to Landlord, to recover compensation for
damage to or taking of any Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or for Tenant's
moving costs, loss of or damage to Tenant's personal property, loss to Tenant
because of interruption of business, Tenant's loss of goodwill, and the value
attributable to any leasehold value for the difference between the market value
of the Premises for the remainder or the term above the value, at the date of
taking, of the rent payable for the remainder of the term. Tenant will have no
right to pursue a claim based upon the residual value of the Land after
expiration of the term or pursue claims or retain any award to which Landlord is
entitled so as inequitably to diminish Landlord's award. Tenant hereby waives
the provisions of California Code of Civil Procedures Section 1265.130 and any
other similarly enacted statue, and the provisions of this Section 16 shall
govern in the case of a taking.

17.  Assignment or Sublease:

     A.   Consent by Landlord: Except as specifically provided in this Section
17, Tenant may not assign, sublet, hypothecate, or allow a third party to use
the Premises without the express written consent of Landlord, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the event Tenant desires to
assign this Lease or any interest herein or sublet the Premises or any part
thereof, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord (i) executed counterparts of

                                    Page 18
<PAGE>

any agreement and of all ancillary agreements with the proposed
assignee/subtenant, (ii) current financial statements of the transferee covering
the preceding three years, (iii) the nature of the proposed transferee's
business to be carried on in the Premises, (iv) a statement outlining all
consideration to be given on account of the Transfer, and (v) a current
financial statement of Tenant. Landlord may condition its approval of any
Transfer on receipt of a certification from both Tenant and the proposed
transferee of all consideration to be paid to Tenant in connection with such
Transfer. At Landlord's request, Tenant shall also provide additional
information reasonably required by Landlord to determine whether it will consent
to the proposed assignment or sublease. Landlord shall have a eight (8)
business-day period following receipt of all the foregoing within which to
notify Tenant in writing that Landlord elects to: (i) terminate this Lease in
the event the proposed sublease or assignment is for substantially all of space
in the Premises (provided, however, that Landlord shall not have the right to
terminate on any sublease or assignment expiring, including any options in favor
of sublessee/assignee, more than three (3) years prior to the Lease Expiration
Date, including any options under this Lease which have been exercised by
Tenant); (ii) permit Tenant to assign or sublet such space to the named
assignee/subtenant on the terms and conditions set forth in the notice; or (iii)
refuse consent. If Landlord should fail to notify Tenant in writing of such
election within the 30-day period, Landlord shall be deemed to have elected
option (ii) above. In the event Landlord elects option (i) above, this Lease
shall expire with respect to such part of the Premises on the date upon which
the proposed sublease or transfer was to commence, and from such date forward,
Base Monthly Rent and all other costs and charges shall be adjusted based upon
the proportion that the rentable area of the Premises remaining bears to the
total rentable area of the Building. In the event Landlord elects option (ii)
above, Landlord's written consent to the proposed assignment or sublease shall
not be unreasonably withheld, provided and upon the condition that: (i) the
proposed assignee or subtenant is engaged in a business that is limited to the
use expressly permitted under this Lease; (ii) the proposed assignment or
sublease is in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; (iii) the proposed
sublease will not result in there being more than two (2) subtenants within the
Premises at any time during the Lease Term; (iv) Tenant reimburses Landlord on
demand for any reasonable costs that may be incurred by Landlord in connection
with said assignment or sublease, including the costs of making investigations
as to the acceptability of the proposed assignee or subtenant and legal costs
(not to exceed $2,000.00 per occurance) incurred in connection with the granting
of any requested consent; and (v) Tenant shall not have advertised or publicized
in any way the availability of the Premises without prior notice to Landlord. In
the event all or any one of the foregoing conditions are not satisfied, Landlord
shall be considered to have acted reasonably if it withholds its consent.

     B.   Assignment or Subletting Consideration: Landlord and Tenant hereby
agree that fifty percent (50%) of any rent or other economic consideration (not
including any payments for Tenant's furniture or other personal property owned
by Tenant, any payment for utilities or for other office services provided by
Tenant); (i) realized by Tenant under any sublease or assignment, or (ii)
realized by any subtenant under any sub-sublease of the Premises, in excess of
the Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder after deducting reasonable subletting
and assignment costs directly related to such sublease or assignment including
lease commissions, attorneys fees, costs of demising or otherwise preparing the
sublease space for occupancy, and the unamortized cost of Alterations applicable
to the space so sublet or assigned, shall be paid to Landlord. Tenant's
obligation to pay over Landlord's portion of the consideration constitutes an
obligation for additional rent hereunder. The above provisions relating to
Landlord's right to terminate the Lease and relating to the allocation of excess
rent are independently negotiated terms of the Lease which constitute a material
inducement for the Landlord to enter into the Lease, and are agreed by the
Parties to be commercially reasonable. No assignment or subletting by Tenant
shall relieve it of any obligation under this Lease. Any assignment or
subletting which conflicts with the provisions hereof shall be void.

     C.   No Release: Any assignment or sublease shall be made only if and shall
not be effective until the assignee or subtenant shall execute, acknowledge, and
deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to
Landlord, whereby the assignee or subtenant shall assume all the applicable
<PAGE>

obligations of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed or observed and
shall be subject to all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and
conditions in this Lease. Notwithstanding any such sublease or assignment and
the acceptance of rent by Landlord from any subtenant or assignee, Tenant and
any guarantor shall remain fully liable for the payment of Base Monthly Rent and
additional rent due, and to become due hereunder, for the performance of all the
covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Lease
on the part of Tenant to be performed and for all acts and omissions of any
licensee, subtenant, assignee or any other person claiming under or through any
subtenant or assignee that shall be in violation of any of the terms and
conditions of this Lease, and any such violation shall be deemed a violation by
Tenant. Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and
against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any claims that may be made against
Landlord by the proposed assignee or subtenant (except to the extent caused by
Landlord's gross negligence or willful misconduct) or by any real estate brokers
or other persons claiming compensation in connection with the proposed
assignment or sublease.

     D.   Reorganization of Tenant: The provisions of this Section 17.D shall
apply if Tenant is a corporation and: (i) there is a dissolution, merger,
consolidation, or other reorganization of or affecting Tenant, where Tenant is
not the surviving corporation, or (ii) there is a sale or transfer to one person
or entity (or to any group of related persons or entities) of stock possessing
more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Tenant's
capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of
directors, and after such sale or transfer of stock Tenant's stock is no longer
publicly traded. In a transaction under clause (i) the surviving corporation
shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement in form reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord under which such surviving corporation assumes the
obligations of Tenant hereunder, and in a transaction under clause (ii) the
transferee or buyer shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement
in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord under which such transferee or buyer
assumes the obligations of Tenant under the Lease.

     E.   Permitted Transfers: Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 17, so long as Tenant otherwise complies with the provisions of this
Article, Tenant may enter into any of the following transfers (a "Permitted
Transfer") without Landlord's prior consent, and Landlord shall not be entitled
to terminate the Lease or to receive any part of any subrent resulting therefrom
that would otherwise be due pursuant to Sections 17.A and 17.B. Tenant may
sublease all or part of the Premises or assign its interest in this Lease to (i)
any corporation which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with the original Tenant to this Lease by means of an ownership interest of more
than 50%; (ii) a corporation which results from a merger, consolidation or other
reorganization in which Tenant is not the surviving corporation, so long as the
surviving corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is
equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such
transaction; and (iii) a corporation which purchases or otherwise acquires all
or substantially all of the assets of Tenant so long as such acquiring
corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is equal to or
greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such transaction.

     F.   Effect of Default: In the event of Tenant's default, Tenant hereby
assigns all rents due from any assignment or subletting to Landlord as security
for performance of its obligations under this Lease, and Landlord may collect
such rents as Tenant's Attorney-in-Fact, except that Tenant may collect such
rents unless a default occurs as described in Section 13 above. A termination of
the Lease due to Tenant's default shall not automatically terminate an
assignment or sublease then in existence; rather at Landlord's election, such
assignment or sublease shall survive the Lease termination, the assignee or
subtenant shall attorn to Landlord, and Landlord shall undertake the obligations
of Tenant under the sublease or assignment; except that Landlord shall not be
liable for prepaid rent, security deposits or other defaults of Tenant to the
subtenant or assignee, or for any acts or omissions of Tenant and Tenant's
Agents.

     G.   Conveyance by Landlord: As used in this Lease, the term "Landlord" is
defined only as the owner for the time being of the Premises, so that in the
event of any sale or other conveyance of the Premises or in the event of a

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>

master lease of the Premises, Landlord shall be entirely freed and relieved of
all its covenants and obligations hereunder, and it shall be deemed and
construed, without further agreement between the Parties and the purchaser at
any such sale or the master tenant of the Premises, that the purchaser or master
tenant of the Premises has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants
and obligations of Landlord hereunder. Such transferor shall transfer and
deliver Tenant's security deposit to the purchaser at any such sale or the
master tenant of the Premises, and thereupon the transferor shall be discharged
from any further liability in reference thereto.

     F.   Successors and Assigns: Subject to the provisions this Section 17, the
covenants and conditions of this Lease shall apply to and bind the heirs,
successors, executors, administrators and assigns of all Parties hereto; and all
Parties hereto comprising Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable
hereunder.

18.  Option to Extend the Lease Term:

     A.   Grant and Exercise of Option: Provided Tenant simultaneously exercises
its option to extend the lease for Building 2 and Building 3, Landlord grants to
Tenant, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 18.A, two
(2) options (the "Options") to extend the Lease Term for an additional term (the
"Option Term"). Each Option Term shall be for a period of sixty (60) months and
shall be exercised, if at all, by written notice to Landlord no later than nine
(9) months prior to the date the Lease Term would expire but for such exercise,
time being of the essence for the giving of such notice. If Tenant exercises the
Option, all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease except for the
grant of additional Options pursuant to this Section, provided that Base Monthly
Rent for the Premises payable by Tenant during the Option Term shall be the
greater of (i) the Base Monthly Rent applicable to the period immediately prior
to the commencement of the Option Term, and (ii) ninety five percent (95%) of
the Fair Market Rental as hereinafter defined. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if Tenant is in monetary or material non-monetary default under
any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease (beyond applicable cure
periods) either at the time Tenant exercises the Option or at any time
thereafter prior to the commencement date of the Option Term, then Landlord
shall have, in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies provided
in this Lease, the right to terminate the Option upon notice to Tenant, in which
event the Lease Term shall not be extended pursuant to this Section 18.A. As
used herein, the term "Fair Market Rental" is defined as the rental and all
other monetary payments, including any escalations and adjustments thereto
(including without limitation Consumer Price Indexing) that Landlord could
obtain during the Option Term from a third party desiring to lease the Premises,
based upon the current use and other potential uses of the Premises, as
determined by the rents then being obtained for new leases of space comparable
in age and quality to the Premises in the same real estate submarket as the
Building. The appraisers shall be instructed that the foregoing five percent
(5%) discount is intended to offset comparable rents that include the following
costs which Landlord will not incur in the event Tenant exercises its option (i)
brokerage commissions, (ii) tenant improvement allowances, (iii) building
improvement costs, and (iv) vacancy costs.

     B.   Determination of Fair Market Rental: If Tenant exercises the Option,
Landlord shall send Tenant notice no later than two hundred forty (240) days
before to the Lease Expiration Date setting forth the Fair Market Rental for the
Option Term. If Tenant disputes Landlord's determination of Fair Market Rental
for the Option Term, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of
Landlord's notice setting forth Fair Market Rental for the Option Term, send to
Landlord a notice stating that Tenant either elects to terminate its exercise of
the Option, in which event the Option shall lapse and this Lease shall terminate
on the Expiration Date, or that Tenant disagrees with Landlord's determination
of Fair Market Rental for the Option Term and elects to resolve the disagreement
as provided in Section 18.C below. If Tenant does not send Landlord a notice as
provided in the previous sentence, Landlord's determination of Fair Market
Rental shall be the basis for computing the Base Monthly Rent payable by Tenant
during the Option Term. If Tenant elects to resolve the disagreement as provided
in Section 18.C and such procedures are not concluded prior to the commencement
date of the Option Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as Base Monthly Rent
ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as determined by Landlord in
the manner provided above. If the Fair Market Rental as

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>

finally determined pursuant to Section 18.C is greater than Landlord's
determination, Tenant shall pay Landlord the difference between the amount paid
by Tenant and ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so
determined in Section 18.C within thirty (30) days after such determination. If
the Fair Market Rental as finally determined in Section 18.C is less than
Landlord's determination, the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and
ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so determined in Section
18.C shall be credited against the next installments of Base Monthly Rent due
from Tenant to Landlord hereunder.

     C.   Resolution of a Disagreement over the Fair Market Rental: Any
disagreement regarding Fair Market Rental shall be resolved as follows:

          1.   Within thirty (30) days after Tenant's response to Landlord's
notice setting forth the Fair Market Rental, Landlord and Tenant shall meet at a
mutually agreeable time and place, in an attempt to resolve the disagreement.

          2.   If within the 30-day period referred to above, Landlord and
Tenant cannot reach agreement as to Fair Market Rental, each party shall select
one appraiser to determine Fair Market Rental. Each such appraiser shall arrive
at a determination of Fair Market Rental and submit their conclusions to
Landlord and Tenant within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the 30-day
consultation period described above.

          3.   If only one appraisal is submitted within the requisite time
period, it shall be deemed as Fair Market Rental. If both appraisals are
submitted within such time period and the two appraisals so submitted differ by
less than ten percent (10%), the average of the two shall be deemed as Fair
Market Rental. If the two appraisals differ by more than 10%, the appraisers
shall immediately select a third appraiser who shall, within thirty (30) days
after his selection, make and submit to Landlord and Tenant a determination of
Fair Market Rental. This third appraisal will then be averaged with the closer
of the two previous appraisals and the result shall be Fair Market Rental.

          4.   All appraisers specified pursuant to this Section shall be
members of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers with not less than
ten (10) years experience appraising office and industrial properties in the
Santa Clara Valley. Each party shall pay the cost of the appraiser selected by
such party and one-half of the cost of the third appraiser.

     D.   Personal to Tenant: All Options provided to Tenant in this Lease are
personal and granted to VeriSign, Inc. (and any permitted transferee pursuant to
Section 17.E. above) and are not exercisable by any third party should Tenant
assign or sublet all or a portion of its rights under this Lease, unless
Landlord consents to permit exercise of any option by any assignee or subtenant,
in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion. In the event Tenant has multiple
options to extend this Lease, a later option to extend the Lease cannot be
exercised unless the prior option has been properly exercised.

19.  General Provisions:

     A.   Attorney's Fees: In the event a suit or alternative form of dispute
resolution is brought for the possession of the Premises, for the recovery of
any sum due hereunder, to interpret the Lease, or because of the breach of any
other covenant herein; then the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party
reasonable attorney's fees including the expense of expert witnesses,
depositions and court testimony as part of its costs which shall be deemed to
have accrued on the commencement of such action. The prevailing party shall also
be entitled to recover all costs and expenses including reasonable attorney's
fees incurred in enforcing any judgment or award against the other party. The
foregoing provision relating to post-judgment costs is severable from all other
provisions of this Lease.

     B.   Authority of Parties: Tenant represents and warrants that it is duly
formed and in good standing, and is duly authorized to execute and deliver this
Lease on behalf of said corporation, in accordance with a duly adopted
resolution of the Board of Directors of said corporation or in accordance with
the by-laws of said corporation, and that this Lease is binding upon said
corporation in accordance with its terms. At Landlord's request, Tenant shall
provide Landlord with corporate resolutions or other proof in a form acceptable
to Landlord, authorizing the execution of the Lease.

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>

     C. Brokers: Tenant represents it has not utilized or contacted a real
estate broker or finder with respect to this Lease other than Cornish & Carey
Commercial and Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless
against any claim, cost, liability or cause of action asserted by any other
broker or finder claiming through Tenant.

     D. Choice of Law: This Lease shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with California law. Except as provided in Section 19.E, venue shall
be Santa Clara County.

     E. Dispute Resolution: Landlord and Tenant and any other party that may
become a party to this Lease or be deemed a party to this Lease including any
subtenants agree that, except for any claim by Landlord for unlawful detainer or
any claim within the jurisdiction of the small claims court (which small claims
court shall be the sole court of competent jurisdiction), any controversy,
dispute, or claim of whatever nature arising out of, in connection with or in
relation to the interpretation, performance or breach of this Lease, including
any claim based on contract, tort, or statute, shall be resolved at the request
of any party to this agreement through a two-step dispute resolution process
administered by J.A.M.S. or another judicial mediation service mutually
acceptable to the parties located in Santa Clara County, California. The dispute
resolution process shall involve first, mediation, followed, if necessary, by
final and binding arbitration administered by and in accordance with the then
existing rules and practices of J.A.M.S. or other judicial mediation service
selected. In the event of any dispute subject to this provision, either party
may initiate a request for mediation and the parties shall use reasonable
efforts to promptly select a J.A.M.S. mediator and commence the mediation. In
the event the parties are not able to agree on a mediator within thirty (30)
days, J. A. M. S. or another judicial mediation service mutually acceptable to
the parties shall appoint a mediator. The mediation shall be confidential and in
accordance with California Evidence Code (S). 1119 et. seq. The mediation shall
be held in Santa Clara County, California and in accordance with the existing
rules and practice of J. A. M. S. (or other judicial and mediation service
selected). The parties shall use reasonable efforts to conclude the mediation
within sixty (60) days of the date of either party's request for mediation. The
mediation shall be held prior to any arbitration or court action (other than a
claim by Landlord for unlawful detainer or any claim within the jurisdiction of
the small claims court which are not subject to this mediation/arbitration
provision and may be filed directly with a court of competent jurisdiction).
Should the prevailing party in any dispute subject to this Section 19.E attempt
an arbitration or a court action before attempting to mediate, the prevailing
party shall not be entitled to attorney's fees that might otherwise be available
to them in a court action or arbitration and in addition thereto, the party who
is determined by the arbitrator to have resisted mediation, shall be sanctioned
by the arbitrator or judge.

IF A MEDIATION IS CONDUCTED BUT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, IT SHALL BE FOLLOWED BY FINAL
AND BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEN EXISTING
RULES AND PRACTICES OF J.A.M.S. OR THE OTHER JUDICIAL AND MEDIATION SERVICE
SELECTED, AND JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY BE
ENTERED BY ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF AS PROVIDED BY
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1280 ET. SEQ, AS SAID STATUTES THEN
APPEAR, INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS TO SAID STATUTES OR SUCCESSORS TO SAID STATUTES
OR AMENDED STATUTES, EXCEPT THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PARTIES BE ENTITLED TO
PROPOUND INTERROGATORIES OR REQUEST FOR ADMISSIONS DURING THE ARBITRATION
PROCESS. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL BE A RETIRED JUDGE OR A LICENSED CALIFORNIA
ATTORNEY. THE VENUE FOR ANY SUCH ARBITRATION OR MEDIATION SHALL BE IN SANTA
CLARA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.

LANDLORD: /s/ JMS           TENANT: /s/ DLE
          -------------             -------------

     F. Entire Agreement: This Lease and the exhibits attached hereto contains
all of the agreements and conditions made between the Parties hereto and may not
be modified orally or in any other manner other than by written agreement signed
by all parties hereto or their respective successors in interest. This Lease
supersedes and revokes all previous negotiations, letters of intent, lease
proposals, brochures, agreements, representations, promises, warranties, and
understandings, whether oral or in writing, between the parties or their
respective representatives or any other person purporting to represent Landlord
or Tenant.

     G. Entry by Landlord: Upon prior notice to Tenant and subject to Tenant's
reasonable security regulations, Tenant shall permit Landlord and his agents to
enter into and upon the Premises at all reasonable times, and without any rent
abatement or reduction or any liability to Tenant for any reasonable loss of
occupation or quiet enjoyment of the Premises thereby occasioned, for the
following purposes: (i) inspecting and maintaining the Premises; (ii) making
repairs, alterations or additions to the Premises; (iii) erecting additional
building(s) and improvements on the land where the Premises are situated or on
adjacent land owned by Landlord; (iv) performing any obligations of Landlord
under the Lease including remediation of Hazardous Materials if determined to be
the responsibility of Landlord, (v) posting and keeping posted thereon notices
of non-responsibility for any construction, alteration or repair thereof, as
required or permitted by any law, and (vi) showing the Premises to Landlord's or
the Master Landlord's existing or potential successors, purchaser, tenants and
lenders. Tenant shall permit Landlord and his agents, at any time within one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Expiration Date (or at any time during
the Lease if Tenant is in default hereunder), to place upon the Premises "For
Lease" signs and exhibit the Premises to real estate brokers and prospective
tenants at reasonable hours.

     H. Estoppel Certificates: At any time during the Lease Term, each party
(the "Responding Party") shall, within ten (10) business days following written
notice from the other party (the "Requesting Party"), execute and deliver to the
Requesting Party a written statement certifying, if true, the following: (i)
that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified,
stating the nature of such modification); (ii) the date to which rent and other
charges are paid in advance, if any; (iii) acknowledging that there are not, to
Responding Party's knowledge, any uncured defaults on Requesting Party's part
hereunder (or specifying such defaults if they are claimed); and (iv) such other
information as Requesting Party may reasonably request. Any such statement may
be conclusively relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of
Requesting Party's interest in the Premises. The Responding Party's failure to
deliver such statement within such time shall be conclusive upon the Responding
Party that this Lease is in full force and effect without modification, except
as may be represented by the Requesting Party, and that there are no uncured
defaults in Requesting Party's performance. Tenant agrees to provide, within
five (5) days of Landlord's request, Tenant's most recent three (3) years of
audited financial statements for Landlord's use in financing or sale of the
Premises or Landlord's interest therein.

     I. Exhibits: All exhibits referred to are attached to this Lease and
incorporated by reference.

     J. Interest: All rent due hereunder, if not paid when due, shall bear
interest at the rate of the Reference Rate published by Bank of America, San
Francisco Branch, plus two percent (2%) per annum from that date until paid in
full ("Agreed Interest Rate"). This provision shall survive the expiration or
sooner termination of the Lease. Despite any other

                                    Page 24
<PAGE>

provision of this Lease, the total liability for interest payments shall not
exceed the limits, if any, imposed by the usury laws of the State of California.
Any interest paid in excess of those limits shall be refunded to Tenant by
application of the amount of excess interest paid against any sums outstanding
in any order that Landlord requires. If the amount of excess interest paid
exceeds the sums outstanding, the portion exceeding those sums shall be refunded
in cash to Tenant by Landlord. To ascertain whether any interest payable exceeds
the limits imposed, any non-principal payment (including late charges) shall be
considered to the extent permitted by law to be an expense or a fee, premium, or
penalty rather than interest.

     K. This section intentionally left blank.

     L. No Presumption Against Drafter: Landlord and Tenant understand, agree
and acknowledge that this Lease has been freely negotiated by both Parties; and
that in any controversy, dispute, or contest over the meaning, interpretation,
validity, or enforceability of this Lease or any of its terms or conditions,
there shall be no inference, presumption, or conclusion drawn whatsoever against
either party by virtue of that party having drafted this Lease or any portion
thereof.

     M. Notices: All notices, demands, requests, or consents required to be
given under this Lease shall be sent in writing by U.S. certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal delivery addressed to the party to be notified
at the address for such party specified in Section 1 of this Lease, or to such
other place as the party to be notified may from time to time designate by at
least fifteen (15) days prior notice to the notifying party. When this Lease
requires service of a notice, that notice shall satisfy rather than supplement
any similar statutorily required notice, including any notice required by Code
of Civil Procedure Section 1161 or any similar or successor statute. When a
statute requires service of a notice in a particular manner, service of such
notice in the manner described in the first sentence of this Section 19.M. shall
satisfy such statutory requirement.

     N. Property Management: In addition, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord along
with the expenses to be reimbursed by Tenant a monthly fee for management
services rendered by either Landlord or a third party manager engaged by
Landlord (which may be a party affiliated with Landlord), in the amount of three
percent (3%) of the Base Monthly Rent.

     O. Rent: All monetary sums due from Tenant to Landlord under this Lease,
including, without limitation those referred to as "additional rent", shall be
deemed as rent.

     P. Representations: Tenant acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any of
its employees or agents have made any agreements, representations, warranties or
promises with respect to the Premises or with respect to present or future
rents, expenses, operations, tenancies or any other matter. Except as herein
expressly set forth herein, Tenant relied on no statement of Landlord or its
employees or agents for that purpose.

     Q. Rights and Remedies: Subject to Section 14 above, All rights and
remedies hereunder are cumulative and not alternative to the extent permitted by
law, and are in addition to all other rights and remedies in law and in equity.

     R. Severability: If any term or provision of this Lease is held
unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
the Lease shall not be invalidated thereby but shall be enforceable in
accordance with its terms, omitting the invalid or unenforceable term.

     S. Submission of Lease: Submission of this document for examination or
signature by the parties does not constitute an option or offer to lease the
Premises on the terms in this document or a reservation of the Premises in favor
of Tenant. This document is not effective as a lease or otherwise until executed
and delivered by both Landlord and Tenant.

     T. Subordination: This Lease is subject and subordinate to ground and
underlying leases, mortgages and deeds of trust (collectively "Encumbrances")
which may now affect the Premises, to any covenants, conditions or restrictions
of record, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and
extensions thereof; provided, however, if the holder or holders of any such
Encumbrance ("Holder") require that this Lease be prior and superior thereto,
within seven (7) days after written request of Landlord to Tenant, Tenant shall
execute, have acknowledged and deliver all documents or instruments, in the
commercially reasonable form presented to

                                    Page 25
<PAGE>

Tenant, which Landlord or Holder deems necessary or desirable for such purposes.
Landlord shall have the right to cause this Lease to be and become and remain
subject and subordinate to any and all Encumbrances which are now or may
hereafter be executed covering the Premises or any renewals, modifications,
consolidations, replacements or extensions thereof, for the full amount of all
advances made or to be made thereunder and without regard to the time or
character of such advances, together with interest thereon and subject to all
the terms and provisions thereof; provided only, that in the event of
termination of any such lease or upon the foreclosure of any such mortgage or
deed of trust, Holder agrees to recognize Tenant's rights under this Lease as
long as Tenant is not in default either at the time Holder recognizes such
rights or at any time thereafter. Within ten (10) business days after Landlord's
written request, Tenant shall execute any documents in commercially reasonable
form required by Landlord or the Holder to make this Lease subordinate to any
lien of the Encumbrance, provided that within those documents the Tenant's
rights under this Lease are recognized only as long as Tenant is not in default.
If Tenant fails to do so, then in addition to such failure constituting a
default by Tenant, it shall be deemed that this Lease is so subordinated to such
Encumbrance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, Tenant
hereby attorns and agrees to attorn to any entity purchasing or otherwise
acquiring the Premises at any sale or other proceeding or pursuant to the
exercise of any other rights, powers or remedies under such encumbrance.

Landlord shall cause the existing lender to furnish to Tenant, within sixty (60)
days of the date of both parties' execution of this Lease, with a written
agreement providing for (i) recognition by the lender of all of the terms and
conditions of this Lease; and (ii) continuation of this Lease upon foreclosure
of existing lender's security interest in the Premises. In the event that
Landlord is unable to provide such agreement, Tenant's sole remedy shall be
termination of the Lease, which election shall be made within fourteen (14) days
following the expiration of such sixty (60) day period.

     U. Survival of Indemnities: All indemnification, defense, and hold harmless
obligations of Landlord and Tenant under this Lease shall survive the expiration
or sooner termination of the Lease.

     V. Time: Time is of the essence hereunder.

     W. Transportation Demand Management Programs: Should a government agency or
municipality require Landlord to institute TDM (Transportation Demand
Management) facilities and/or programs, Tenant agrees that the cost of TDM
imposed facilities and programs required on the Premises, including but not
limited to employee showers, lockers, cafeteria, or lunchroom facilities, shall
be paid by Tenant. Further, any ongoing costs or expenses associated with a TDM
program which are required for the Premises and not provided by Tenant, such as
an on-site TDM coordinator, shall be provided by Landlord with such costs being
included as additional rent and reimbursed to Landlord by Tenant within thirty
(30) days after demand. If TDM facilities and programs are instituted on a
Project wide basis, Tenant shall pay its proportionate share of such costs in
accordance with Section 8 above.

     X. Waiver of Right to Jury Trial: Landlord and Tenant waive their
respective rights to trial by jury of any contract or tort claim, counterclaim,
cross-complaint, or cause of action in any action, proceeding, or hearing
brought by either party against the other on any matter arising out of or in any
way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, or
Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, including any claim of injury or
damage or the enforcement of any remedy under any current or future law,
statute, regulation, code, or ordinance.

     Y. Recordation: A short form Memorandum of Lease, in form and content
reasonably acceptable to the parties, will be executed in recordable form by
each party following execution of this Lease, delivered to Tenant, and may be
recorded by Tenant at its expense.

20.  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER TO PURCHASE:

        A. Grant and Exercise of Option: In the event Landlord elects to sell
the Building either separately or as part of a larger sale including other
building(s) within the Project ("Offered Property"), Landlord (referred to
hereinafter in this Section 20 as "Seller") hereby grants Tenant a right of
first offering to

                                    Page 26
<PAGE>

purchase. Prior to Seller committing to sell its interest in the Offered
Property to a third party, Seller shall give Tenant written notice of such
desire and the terms and other information under which Seller intends to sell
the Offered Property. Provided at the time of such written notice: (i) Tenant
leases at least two buildings within the Project; and (ii) Tenant is not in
default under the Lease beyond the expiration of any applicable cure period,
Tenant shall have the option, which must be exercised, if at all, by written
notice to Seller within fifteen (15) days after Tenant's receipt of Seller's
notice, to purchase Seller's interest in the Offered Property at the sales price
and terms of sale specified in the notice. In the event Tenant timely exercises
such option to purchase its interest in the Offered Property, Seller shall sell
its interest in the Offered Property to Tenant, and Tenant shall purchase its
interest in the Offered Property from Seller in accordance with the price and
terms specified in Seller's notice. Seller and Tenant shall, in good faith,
attempt to reach agreement on the terms of a mutually acceptable purchase
agreement consistent with the terms set forth in Seller's notice within thirty
(30) days of Tenant's exercise of its option to purchase. In the event either:
(i) Tenant fails to exercise Tenant's option within said 15-day period; or (ii)
after Tenant's exercise, Seller and Tenant are unable to reach agreement on a
mutually acceptable purchase agreement within the subsequent 30-day period;
Seller shall have one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter to sell its interest
in the Offered Property at no less than ninety percent (90%) of the sales price
and upon substantially the same other terms of sale as specified in the notice
to Tenant. In the event Seller fails to sell its interest in the Offered
Property within said one hundred eighty (180) day period or in the event Seller
proposes to sell its interest in the Offered Property at less than ninety
percent (90%) of the sales price or on other material terms which are more
favorable to the prospective buyer than that proposed to Tenant, Seller shall be
required to resubmit such offer to Tenant in accordance with this Right of First
Offering except that Tenant shall be required to respond to any resubmission
within a seven (7) day period.

     B. Exclusions: This Right of First Offering shall automatically terminate
(i) upon the expiration or sooner termination of the Lease, or (ii) in the event
of a foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of Landlord's interest in the
Building. Further, this Right of First Offering shall not apply to transfers
(but shall survive such transfers) of all or a portion of the Building or
Project to (i) John A. Sobrato and/or John M. Sobrato (individually and
collectively "Sobrato"), (ii) any immediate family member of Sobrato, (iii) any
trust established, in whole or in part, for the benefit of Sobrato and/or any
immediate family member of Sobrato, (iv) any partnership in which Sobrato or any
immediate family member, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a
partnership or corporate entity or a trust) retains a general partner interest,
and/or (v) any corporation under the control, either directly or indirectly, by
Sobrato or any immediate family member of Sobrato.

1.  PARTIES:    THIS LEASE, is entered into on this 27th day of October, 2000
("Effective Date") between Sobrato Development Companies #792, a California
Limited Partnership, whose address is 10600 North De Anza Boulevard, Suite 200,
Cupertino, CA  95014 and VeriSign, Inc., a Delaware corporation, whose address
is 1350 Charleston Road, Mountain View, California, 94043, hereinafter called
respectively Landlord and Tenant.

2.  PREMISES:    Landlord hereby leases to Tenant, and Tenant hires from
Landlord those certain Premises with the appurtenances, situated in the City of
Mountain View, County of Santa Clara, State of California, commonly known and
designated as 685 East Middlefield Road, consisting of 162,090 rentable square
feet ("Building") including parking for approximately 535 cars as outlined in
red on Exhibit "A" and all improvements located therein including but not
       -----------
limited to buildings, parking areas and structures, landscaping, loading docks,
sidewalks, service areas and other facilities.

Tenant acknowledges Landlord's potential right to construct an additional 2-
story building of approximately 50,000 square feet ("Expansion Building") on the
Premises as generally shown on Exhibit "A-1".  At Tenant's request, Landlord
shall pursue development of the Expansion Building; provided, however, Landlord
and Tenant shall first execute a Lease amendment that will commit Tenant to
lease the Expansion Building on a "cold shell" basis under construction terms
similar to those which Tenant has leased the adjacent new building to be
constructed at 575 E. Middlefield Road.

    A. Expansion Building Development Approval:    Preparatory to Landlord's
development of the Expansion Building, the parties acknowledge that Landlord is
currently negotiating with the city of Mountain View ("City") to rezone the
Property and obtain a transit-oriented development ("TOD") permit for
construction of the Expansion Building, generally consistent with Exhibit "A-1".
                                                                  --------------
As part of such permit approval, Tenant agrees to:  (i) participate in the
Valley Transportation Authority's ("VTA") Eco-Pass program for employees of
Tenant within the VTA service area; (ii) provide transit subsidies as required
by the City for employees of Tenant outside the VTA service area; and (iii)
otherwise work cooperatively with Landlord and the City towards meeting Tenant-
applicable requirements of TOD permit approval.

3.  USE:

    A. Permitted Uses:    Tenant shall use the Premises as permitted under
applicable zoning laws only for the following purposes and shall not change the
use of the Premises without the prior written consent of Landlord:  Office,
research and development, marketing, light manufacturing, data center, ancillary
storage and other incidental uses. Tenant shall use only the number of parking
spaces allocated to Tenant under this Lease.  All commercial trucks and delivery
vehicles shall (i) be parked at the rear of the Buildings, (ii) loaded and
unloaded in a manner which does not interfere with the businesses of other
occupants of the Project, and (iii) permitted to remain within the Project only
so long as is reasonably necessary to complete the loading and unloading.
Landlord makes no representation or warranty that any specific use of the
Premises desired by Tenant is permitted pursuant to any Laws.

    B. Uses Prohibited:    Tenant shall not commit or suffer to be committed on
the Premises any waste, nuisance, or other act or thing which may disturb the
quiet enjoyment of any other tenant in or around the Premises, nor allow any
sale by auction or any other use of the Premises for an unlawful purpose. Tenant
shall not (i) damage or overload the electrical, mechanical or plumbing systems
of the Premises, (ii) attach, hang or suspend anything from the ceiling, walls
or columns of the Buildings in excess of the load limits for which such items
are designed or set any load on the

                                    Page 1
<PAGE>

floor in excess of the load limits for which for which the floor is designed, or
(iii) generate dust, fumes or waste products which create a fire or health
hazard or damage the Premises or any portion of the Project, including without
limitation the soils or ground water in or around the Project. No materials,
supplies, equipment, finished products or semi-finished products, raw materials
or articles of any nature, or any waste materials, refuse, scrap or debris,
shall be stored upon or permitted to remain on any portion of the Premises
outside of the Buildings without Landlord's prior approval, which approval may
be withheld in its reasonable discretion.

    C. Advertisements and Signs:    Tenant will not place or permit to be
placed, in, upon or about the Premises any signs in violation of the city and
other governing authority having jurisdiction. Tenant will not place or permit
to be placed upon the Premises any large prominent outdoor signs, advertisements
or notices without the written consent of Landlord as to type, size, design,
lettering, coloring and location, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld. Any sign placed on the Premises shall be removed by Tenant, at its
sole cost, prior to the Expiration Date or promptly following the earlier
termination of the Lease, and Tenant shall repair, at its sole cost, any damage
or injury to the Premises caused thereby, and if not so removed, then Landlord
may have same so removed at Tenant's expense.

    D. Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions:   This Lease is subject to the
effect of (i) any covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, mortgages or
deeds of trust, ground leases, rights of way of record and any other matters or
documents of record; and (ii) any zoning laws of the city, county and state
where the Buildings are situated (collectively referred to herein as
"Restrictions") and Tenant will conform to and will not violate the terms of any
such Restrictions.

4.  TERM AND RENTAL:

    A. Base Monthly Rent:    The term ("Lease Term") shall be for one hundred
thirty two (132) months, commencing November 1, 2000 ("Commencement Date"), and
ending October 31, 2011 ("Expiration Date").  Notwithstanding the parties'
agreement that the Lease Term begins on the Commencement Date, this Lease and
all of the obligations of Landlord and Tenant shall be binding and in full force
and effect from and after the Effective Date.  In addition to all other sums
payable by Tenant under this Lease, Tenant shall pay base monthly rent ("Base
Monthly Rent") for the Premises according to the following schedule, subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 4.B. below:

Months 01-12:    $1,215,675.00 per month
Months 13-24:    $1,264,302.00 per month
Months 25-36:    $1,314,874.00 per month
Months 37-48:    $1,367,469.00 per month
Months 49-60:    $1,422,168.00 per month
Months 61-72:    $1,479,055.00 per month
Months 73-84:    $1,538,217.00 per month
Months 85-96:    $1,599,745.00 per month
Months 97-108:   $1,663,735.00 per month
Months 109-120:  $1,730,285.00 per month
Months 121-132:  $1,799,496.00 per month

Base Monthly Rent shall be due in advance on or before the first day of each
calendar month during the Lease Term.  All sums payable by Tenant under this
Lease shall be paid to Landlord in lawful money of the United States of America,
without offset or deduction and without prior notice or demand, at the address
specified in Section 1 of this Lease or at such place or places as may be
designated in writing by Landlord during the Lease Term.  Base Monthly Rent for
any period less than a calendar month shall be a pro rata portion of the monthly
installment.

    B. Tenant Subleases:    Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease
Tenant is entering into the following two subleases:  (i) 53,000 square feet of
the Premises to America Online ("AOL Sublease") through December 31, 2001 at a
monthly rate of $79,500; and (ii) 55,540 square feet of the Premises to Hewlett
Packard ("Hewlett Packard Sublease") though February 28, 2003 at a monthly rate
of $138,467.61 through August 31, 2001, $142,621.64 through August 31, 2002, and
$146,900.28 through February 28, 2003.  The Base Monthly Rent schedule set forth
in Section 4.A. above notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that upon
execution of the subleases, the Base Monthly Rent due from Tenant during the
term of the subleases shall be reduced so that Tenant pays no more per square
foot on those subleased areas than the rate that Tenant is receiving pursuant to
the AOL Sublease and Hewlett Packard Sublease.

    C. Late Charges:    Tenant hereby acknowledges that late payment by Tenant
to

                                    Page 2
<PAGE>

Landlord of Base Monthly Rent and other sums due hereunder will cause Landlord
to incur costs not contemplated by this Lease, the exact amount of which is
extremely difficult to ascertain.  Such costs include but are not limited to:
administrative, processing, accounting, and late charges which may be imposed on
Landlord by the terms of any contract, revolving credit, mortgage, or trust deed
covering the Premises.  Accordingly, if any installment of Base Monthly Rent or
other sum due from Tenant shall not be received by Landlord or its designee
within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of written notice from
Landlord that such installment or sum was not received when due, Tenant shall
pay to Landlord a late charge equal to five (5%) percent of such overdue amount,
which late charge shall be due and payable on the same date that the overdue
amount was due. The parties agree that such late charge represents a fair and
reasonable estimate of the costs Landlord will incur by reason of late payment
by Tenant, excluding interest and reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.  If any
rent or other sum due from Tenant remains delinquent for a period in excess of
thirty (30) days then, in addition to such late charge, Tenant shall pay to
Landlord interest on any rent that is not paid when due at the Agreed Interest
Rate specified in Section 19.J following the date such amount became due until
paid.  Acceptance by Landlord of such late charge shall not constitute a waiver
of Tenant's default with respect to such overdue amount nor prevent Landlord
from exercising any of the other rights and remedies granted hereunder.  In the
event that a late charge is payable hereunder, whether or not collected, for
four (4) consecutive installments of Base Monthly Rent, then the Base Monthly
Rent shall automatically become due and payable quarterly in advance, rather
than monthly, notwithstanding any provision of this Lease to the contrary.

    D. Security Deposit:    Concurrently with Tenant's execution of this Lease,
Tenant has deposited with Landlord the sum of One Million Two Hundred Fifteen
Thousand Six Hundred Seventy Five and No/100 Dollars ($1,215,675.00) ("Security
"Deposit"). Landlord shall not be deemed a trustee of the Security Deposit, may
use the Security Deposit in business, and shall not be required to segregate it
from its general accounts. Tenant shall not be entitled to interest on the
Security Deposit.  If Tenant defaults with respect to any provisions of the
Lease, including but not limited to the provisions relating to payment of Base
Monthly Rent or other charges, Landlord may, to the extent reasonably necessary
to remedy Tenant's default, use any or all of the Security Deposit towards
payment of the following:  (i) Base Monthly Rent or other charges in default;
(ii) any other amount which Landlord may spend or become obligated to spend by
reason of Tenant's default including, but not limited to Tenant's failure to
restore or clean the Premises following vacation thereof.  If any portion of the
Security Deposit is so used or applied, Tenant shall, within ten (10) days after
written demand from Landlord, deposit cash with Landlord in an amount sufficient
to restore the Security Deposit to its full original amount, and shall pay to
Landlord such other sums as necessary to reimburse Landlord for any sums paid by
Landlord.  If Tenant shall be in either monetary default or material non-
monetary default more than four (4) times in any twelve (12) month period, then
the Security Deposit shall, within ten (10) days after demand by Landlord, be
increased by Tenant to an amount equal to three (3) times the Base Monthly Rent.
Tenant may not assign or encumber the Security Deposit without the consent of
Landlord.  Any attempt to do so shall be void and shall not be binding on
Landlord.  The Security Deposit shall be returned to Tenant within thirty (30)
days after the Expiration Date and surrender of the Premises to Landlord, less
any amount deducted in accordance with this Section, together with Landlord's
written notice itemizing the amounts and purposes for such deduction.  In the
event of termination of Landlord's interest in this Lease, Landlord may deliver
or credit the Security Deposit to Landlord's successor in interest in the
Premises and thereupon be relieved of further responsibility with respect to the
Security Deposit.

Landlord agrees that in lieu of a cash Security Deposit, Tenant may deposit a
letter of credit ("Letter of Credit") substantially in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit "B".  Landlord shall be entitled to draw against the Letter of Credit
   -----------
at any time provided only that Landlord certifies to the issuer of the Letter of
Credit that Tenant is in default under the Lease.  Tenant shall keep the letter
of credit in effect during the entire Lease Term, as the same may be extended,
plus a period of four (4) weeks after expiration of the Lease Term.  At least
thirty (30) days prior to expiration of any Letter of Credit, the term thereof
shall be renewed or extended for a period of at least one (1) year.  Tenant's
failure to

                                    Page 3
<PAGE>

so renew or extend the Letter of Credit shall be a material default
of this Lease by Tenant.  In the event Landlord draws against the Letter of
Credit, Tenant shall replenish the existing Letter of Credit or cause a new
Letter of Credit to be issued such that the aggregate amount of letters of
credit available to Landlord at all times during the Lease Term is the amount of
the Security Deposit originally required.

5.  CONSTRUCTION:

    A. Landlord's Obligations:    Except as specifically provided in this
paragraph, prior to Commencement Date Landlord shall ensure that the existing
Building and Building systems are in good operating condition and repair
including the foundation, structural components, exterior walls, plumbing, HVAC,
sprinklers, electrical (including panels and outlets), doors (both shipping and
personnel), roof structure and membrane, exterior landscaping, irrigation and
lighting, and parking lot.  "Good operating condition and repair" as used in
this paragraph means that all of the foregoing systems for which Landlord is
responsible shall be fully operational and functional for use for the purposes
for which such systems were intended, and there is no deferred maintenance
required.  Without limitation of the foregoing:  (i) the roof membrane shall be
inspected by a reputable and licensed roofing contractor or roofing inspector
and repaired as necessary to put into good operating condition and repair based
on such inspection; (ii) the HVAC system shall be inspected by a reputable and
licensed HVAC contractor and repaired as necessary to put into good operating
condition and repair based on such inspection, as evidenced by a report by such
contractor; (iii) all windows shall be washed inside and out, and there shall be
no cracked or broken windows; (iv) all burned out, discolored or broken
lightbulbs, ballasts and lenses shall be replaced; and (v) the parking lot shall
be re-sealed and striped by a reputable and licensed asphalt contractor
provided, however, that Landlord shall have sixty days from the Commencement
Date to complete the parking lot re-sealing and striping.

The foregoing notwithstanding, Landlord shall have no obligation to perform any
work on the HVAC, electrical, plumbing, or other Building systems servicing the
Hewlett Packard Sublease space.  Tenant shall be responsible to ensure that
Hewlett Packard leaves that portion of the Premises in good  condition and
repair when it vacates.

6.  ACCEPTANCE OF POSSESSION AND COVENANTS TO SURRENDER:

    A. Delivery and Acceptance:    On the Commencement Date, Landlord shall
deliver and Tenant shall accept possession of the Premises.  Tenant acknowledges
that it has had an opportunity to conduct, and has conducted, such inspections
of the Premises as it deems necessary to evaluate its condition.  Except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, Tenant agrees to accept possession of
the Premises in its then existing condition, subject to all Restrictions and
without representation or warranty by Landlord.

    B. Early Access: Tenant shall be allowed early access and occupancy of the
Premises from September 1, 2000 until the Commencement Date ("Early Access
Period") for the purpose of constructing Tenant Improvements and otherwise
preparing for its occupancy. Tenant shall be subject to all the terms and
conditions of the Lease during the Early Access Period except that no Base
Monthly Rent or other expenses shall be due or payable.

    C. Condition Upon Surrender:    Tenant further agrees on the Expiration Date
or on the sooner termination of this Lease, to surrender the Premises to
Landlord in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear excepted.  In this
regard, "normal wear and tear" shall be construed to mean wear and tear caused
to the Premises by the natural aging process which occurs in spite of prudent
application of the best standards for maintenance, repair replacement, and
janitorial practices, and does not include items of neglected or deferred
maintenance.  In any event, Tenant shall cause the following to be done prior to
the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease: (i) all interior walls
shall be painted or cleaned so that they appear freshly painted, (ii) all tiled
floors shall be cleaned and waxed, (iii) all carpets shall be cleaned and
shampooed, (iv) all broken, marred, stained or nonconforming acoustical ceiling
tiles shall be replaced, (v) all cabling placed above the ceiling by Tenant or
Tenant's contractors shall be removed unless such cabling has been placed in
trays especially designed for such purpose and is not weighing directly on the
ceiling, (vi) all windows shall be washed; (vii) the HVAC system shall be
serviced by a

                                    Page 4
<PAGE>

reputable and licensed service firm and left in "good operating
condition and repair" as evidenced by a report by such firm, (viii) the plumbing
and electrical systems and lighting shall be placed in good order and repair
(including replacement of any burned out, discolored or broken light bulbs,
ballasts, or lenses. On or before the Expiration Date or sooner termination of
this Lease, Tenant shall remove all its personal property and trade fixtures
from the Premises.  All property and fixtures not so removed shall be deemed as
abandoned by Tenant.  At the expiration of the Lease Term, Landlord shall not
have the right to require that Tenant remove from the Premises any Alterations
(as defined in Section 7 below) made with Landlord's consent unless Landlord, at
the time of granting such consent, indicates that the subject Alteration must be
removed upon the expiration of the Lease Term.  With respect to Permitted
Alterations as defined in Section 7A. below, Tenant shall ascertain from
Landlord within ninety (90) days before the Expiration Date whether Landlord
desires to have such Permitted Alterations removed.  If Landlord so elects,
Tenant shall, at its sole cost and expense, remove such Alterations as Landlord
has required and shall repair and restore the affected areas of the Premises
prior to the Expiration Date to a standard open office plan with materials and
finishes consistent with the other open office areas within the Premises.  Such
repair and restoration shall include causing the Premises to be brought into
compliance with all applicable building codes and laws in effect at the time of
the removal to the extent such compliance is necessitated by the repair and
restoration work.

    D. Failure to Surrender:    If the Premises are not surrendered at the
Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease in the condition required by
this Section 6, Tenant shall be deemed in a holdover tenancy pursuant to this
Section 6.D. and Tenant shall indemnify, defend, and hold Landlord harmless
against loss or liability resulting from delay by Tenant in so surrendering the
Premises including, without limitation, any claims made by any succeeding tenant
founded on such delay and costs incurred by Landlord in returning the Premises
to the required condition, plus interest at the Agreed Interest Rate.   Any
holding over after the termination or Expiration Date with Landlord's express
written consent, shall be construed as month-to-month tenancy, terminable on
thirty (30) days written notice from either party, and Tenant shall pay as Base
Monthly Rent to Landlord a rate equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%)
of the Base Monthly Rent due in the month preceding the termination or
Expiration Date, plus all other amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease.  Any
holding over shall otherwise be on the terms and conditions herein specified,
except those provisions relating to the Lease Term and any options to extend or
renew, which provisions shall be of no further force and effect following the
expiration of the applicable exercise period.  If Tenant remains in possession
of the Premises after the Expiration Date or sooner termination of this Lease
without Landlord's consent, Tenant's continued possession shall be on the basis
of a tenancy at sufferance and Tenant shall pay as rent during the holdover
period an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Base Monthly
Rent due in the month preceding the termination or Expiration Date, plus all
other amounts payable by Tenant under this Lease.  This provision shall survive
the termination or expiration of the Lease.

7.  ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS:

    A. Tenant's Alterations:   Tenant shall not make, or suffer to be made, any
alteration or addition to the Premises ("Alterations"), or any part thereof,
without obtaining Landlord's prior written consent and delivering to Landlord
the proposed architectural and structural plans for all such Alterations at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the start of construction. If such Alterations
affect the structure of the Buildings, Tenant additionally agrees to reimburse
Landlord its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in reviewing Tenant's
plans. After obtaining Landlord's consent, which consent shall state whether or
not Landlord will require Tenant to remove such Alteration at the expiration or
earlier termination of this Lease, Tenant shall not proceed to make such
Alterations until Tenant has obtained all required governmental approvals and
permits. Tenant agrees to provide Landlord (i) written notice of the anticipated
and actual start-date of the work, (ii) a complete set of half-size (15" X 21")
vellum as-built drawings, and (iii) a certificate of occupancy for the work upon
completion of the Alterations. All Alterations shall be constructed in
compliance with all applicable building codes and laws including, without
limitation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as amended from time to
time. Upon the Expiration Date, all Alterations,

                                    Page 5
<PAGE>

except movable furniture and trade fixtures, shall become a part of the realty
and belong to Landlord but shall nevertheless be subject to removal by Tenant as
provided in Section 6 above. Alterations which are not deemed as trade fixtures
include heating, lighting, electrical systems, air conditioning, walls,
carpeting, or any other installation which has become an integral part of the
Premises (excepting backup power generators or a UPS system, which Tenant shall
have the right to remove). All Alterations shall be maintained, replaced or
repaired by Tenant at its sole cost and expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant shall be entitled, without obtaining
Landlord's consent, to make Alterations which do not affect the structure of the
Buildings and which do not cost more than Seventy Thousand Dollars ($70,000.00)
per Alteration ("Permitted Alterations"); provided, however, that:  (i) Tenant
shall still be required to comply with all other provisions of this paragraph;
and (ii) such Permitted Alterations are subject to removal by Tenant at
Landlord's election pursuant to Section 6.C. above at the expiration or earlier
termination of the Lease.

    B. Free From Liens:    Tenant shall keep the Premises free from all liens
arising out of work performed, materials furnished, or obligations incurred by
Tenant or claimed to have been performed for Tenant.  In the event Tenant fails
to discharge any such lien within sixty (60) days after receiving notice of the
filing, Landlord shall be entitled to discharge the lien at Tenant's expense and
all resulting costs incurred by Landlord, including attorney's fees shall be due
from Tenant as additional rent.

    C. Compliance With Governmental Regulations: The term Laws or Governmental
Regulations shall include all federal, state, county, city or governmental
agency laws, statutes, ordinances, standards, rules, requirements, or orders now
in force or hereafter enacted, promulgated, or issued.  The term also includes
government measures regulating or enforcing public access, traffic mitigation,
occupational, health, or safety standards for employers, employees, landlords,
or tenants. Tenant, at Tenant's sole expense shall make all repairs,
replacements, alterations, or improvements needed to comply with all
Governmental Regulations.  The judgment of any court of competent jurisdiction
or the admission of Tenant in any action or proceeding against Tenant (whether
Landlord be a party thereto or not) that Tenant has violated any such law,
regulation or other requirement in its use of the Premises shall be conclusive
of that fact as between Landlord and Tenant.

The foregoing notwithstanding, if any repair, replacement, alteration or
improvement is required to the Buildings foundation, exterior load bearing
walls, roof structure or any other structural component of the Buildings
(excluding structural components installed by Tenant) as a result of any
Governmental Regulations and such required work is not caused by Tenant's
specific use or Alterations, the cost of such repair, replacement, alteration or
improvement shall be allocated between Landlord and Tenant such that Tenant
shall pay to Landlord upon completion of such work, the portion of the cost
equal to the product of such cost multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of years remaining in the Lease Term, the denominator of
which is the useful life (in years) of the repair, replacement, alteration or
addition; provided, however, that if the Tenant thereafter exercises a renewal
option, then upon Tenant's exercise of the renewal option, the numerator of the
fraction shall be adjusted to the sum of:  (i) the Lease Term remaining at the
time the repair, replacement, alteration or addition was made; and (ii) the
number of years in the Option Term; and Landlord's reimbursement obligation
shall immediately thereafter be re-calculated.

8.  MAINTENANCE OF PREMISES:

    A. Landlord's Obligations:    Landlord at its sole cost and expense, shall
maintain in good condition, order, and repair, and replace as and when
necessary, the foundation, exterior load bearing walls and roof structure, and
all other structural components of the Buildings, excluding any components
installed by Tenant.

    B. Tenant's Obligations:    Tenant shall clean maintain, repair and replace
when necessary the Premises and every part thereof through regular inspections
and servicing, including but not limited to: (i) all plumbing and sewage
facilities, (ii) all heating ventilating and air conditioning facilities and
equipment, (iii) all fixtures, interior walls floors, carpets and ceilings, (iv)
all windows, door entrances, plate glass and glazing systems including caulking,
and skylights, (v) all electrical facilities and equipment, (vi) all automatic
fire extinguisher

                                    Page 6
<PAGE>

equipment, (vii) the parking lot and all underground utility facilities
servicing the Premises, (viii) all elevator equipment; (ix) the roof membrane
system, and (x) all waterscape, landscaping and shrubbery. All wall surfaces and
floor tile are to be maintained in an as good a condition as when Tenant took
possession free of holes, gouges, or defacements. With respect to items (ii),
(viii) and (ix) above, Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of a service
contract between Tenant & a licensed service contractor providing for periodic
maintenance of all such systems or equipment in conformance with the
manufacturer's recommendations. Tenant shall provide Landlord a copy of such
preventive maintenance contracts and paid invoices for the recommended work if
requested by Landlord.

If as a part of Tenant's fulfillment of its maintenance obligations during the
last three (3) years of the Lease Term a replacement of the roof membrane is
necessary, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant for the cost of the replacement less
the sum of (i) Thirty Thousand Dollars ($30,000.00) plus (ii) that portion of
the cost over $30,000.00 equal to the product of such cost multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years remaining in the Lease
Term, the denominator of which is the useful life (in years) of the roof
replacement; provided, however, that if the roof replacement is made during the
initial Lease Term and Tenant thereafter exercises a renewal option, then upon
Tenant's exercise of the renewal option, the numerator of the fraction shall be
adjusted to the sum of:  (i) the Lease Term remaining at the time the roof
replacement was made; and (ii) the number of years in the Option Term; and
Landlord's reimbursement obligation shall immediately thereafter be re-
calculated.

    C. Waiver of Liability:     Failure by Landlord to perform any defined
services, or any cessation thereof, when such failure is caused by accident,
breakage, repairs, strikes, lockout or other labor disturbances or labor
disputes of any character or by any other cause, similar or dissimilar, shall
not render Landlord liable to Tenant in any respect, including damages to either
person or property, except to the extent due to Landlord's active negligence or
willful misconduct, nor be construed as an eviction of Tenant, nor cause an
abatement of rent, nor relieve Tenant from fulfillment of any covenant or
agreement hereof.  Should any equipment or machinery utilized in supplying the
services listed herein break down or for any cause cease to function properly,
upon receipt of written notice from Tenant of any deficiency or failure of any
services, Landlord shall use reasonable diligence to repair the same promptly,
but Tenant shall have no right to terminate this Lease and shall have no claim
for rebate of rent or damages on account of any interruptions in service
occasioned thereby or resulting therefrom, except to the extent due to
Landlord's active negligence or willful misconduct.  Tenant waives the
provisions of California Civil Code Sections 1941 and 1942 concerning the
Landlord's obligation of tenantability and Tenant's right to make repairs and
deduct the cost of such repairs from the rent.  Landlord shall not be liable for
a loss of or injury to person or property, however occurring, through or in
connection with or incidental to furnishing, or its failure to furnish, any of
the foregoing.

9.  HAZARD INSURANCE:

    A. Tenant's Use:    Tenant shall not use or permit the Premises, or any
part thereof, to be used for any purpose other than that for which the Premises
are hereby leased; and no use of the Premises shall be made or permitted, nor
acts done, which will cause an increase in premiums or a cancellation of any
insurance policy covering the Premises or any part thereof, nor shall Tenant
sell or permit to be sold, kept, or used in or about the Premises, any article
prohibited by the standard form of fire insurance policies. Tenant shall, at its
sole cost, comply with all requirements of any insurance company or organization
necessary for the maintenance of reasonable fire and public liability insurance
covering the Premises and appurtenances.

    B. Landlord's Insurance:    Landlord agrees to purchase and keep in force
fire, extended coverage insurance in an amount equal to the replacement cost of
the Buildings (not including any Tenant Improvements or Alterations paid for by
Tenant) as determined by Landlord's insurance company's appraisers. At
Landlord's election, such fire and property damage insurance may be endorsed to
cover loss caused by such additional perils against which Landlord may elect to
insure, including earthquake and/or flood, and shall contain reasonable
deductibles.  Additionally Landlord may maintain a policy of (i) commercial
general liability insurance insuring Landlord (and such others designated by
Landlord) against liability

                                    Page 7
<PAGE>

for personal injury, bodily injury, death and damage to property occurring or
resulting from an occurrence in, on or about the Premises or Project in an
amount as Landlord determines is reasonably necessary for its protection, and
(ii) rental loss insurance covering a twelve (12) month period. Tenant agrees to
pay Landlord as additional rent, on demand, the full cost of said insurance as
evidenced by insurance billings to Landlord, and in the event of damage covered
by said insurance, the amount of any deductible under such policy. Payment shall
be due to Landlord within ten (10) days after written invoice to Tenant. It is
understood and agreed that Tenant's obligation under this Section will be
prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and Expiration Dates.

    C. Tenant's Insurance:    Tenant agrees, at its sole cost, to insure its
personal property, Tenant Improvements, and Alterations for their full
replacement value (without depreciation) and to obtain worker's compensation and
public liability and property damage insurance for occurrences within the
Premises with a combined single limit of not less than Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000.00).  Tenant's liability insurance shall be primary insurance
containing a cross-liability endorsement, and shall provide coverage on an
"occurrence" rather than on a "claims made" basis.  Tenant shall name Landlord
and Landlord's lender as an additional insured and shall deliver a copy of the
policies and renewal certificates to Landlord.  All such policies shall provide
for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Landlord of any cancellation,
termination, or reduction in coverage.

    D. Waiver:    Landlord and Tenant hereby waive all rights each may have
against the other on account of any loss or damage sustained by Landlord or
Tenant, as the case may be, or to the Premises or its contents, which may arise
from any risk covered by their respective insurance policies (or which would
have been covered had such insurance policies been maintained in accordance with
this Lease) as set forth above.  The Parties shall use their reasonable efforts
to obtain from their respective insurance companies a waiver of any right of
subrogation which said insurance company may have against Landlord or Tenant, as
the case may be.

10.  TAXES:    Tenant shall be liable for and shall pay as additional rental,
prior to delinquency, the following:  (i) all taxes and assessments levied
against Tenant's personal property and trade or business fixtures; (ii) all real
estate taxes and assessment installments or other impositions or charges which
may be levied on the Premises or upon the occupancy of the Premises, including
any substitute or additional charges which may be imposed applicable to the
Lease Term; and (iii) real estate tax increases due to an increase in assessed
value resulting from a sale, transfer or other change of ownership of the
Premises as it appears on the City and County tax bills during the Lease Term.
All real estate taxes shall be prorated to reflect the Lease Commencement and
Expiration Dates.  If, at any time during the Lease Term a tax, excise on rents,
business license tax or any other tax, however described, is levied or assessed
against Landlord as a substitute or addition, in whole or in part, for taxes
assessed or imposed on land or Buildings, Tenant shall pay and discharge its pro
rata share of such tax or excise on rents or other tax before it becomes
delinquent; except that this provision is not intended to cover net income
taxes, inheritance, gift or estate tax imposed upon Landlord.  In the event that
a tax is placed, levied, or assessed against Landlord and the taxing authority
takes the position that Tenant cannot pay and discharge its pro rata share of
such tax on behalf of Landlord, then Landlord may increase the Base Monthly Rent
by the exact amount of such tax and Tenant shall pay such increase.  If by
virtue of any application or proceeding brought by Landlord, there results a
reduction in the assessed value of the Premises during the Lease Term, Tenant
agrees to pay Landlord a fee consistent with the fees charged by a third party
appeal firm for such services.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if property taxes increase during the first three
years of the Lease Term as a result of a reassessment due to a voluntary change
of ownership, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of the resulting property
tax increase as follows:  during the first twelve months, Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of thirty three percent (33%) of the tax increase;
during the second twelve months, Tenant shall be responsible for payment of
sixty seven percent (67%) of the tax increase, thereafter Tenant shall be
responsible for payment of the entire tax increase.

11.  UTILITIES:    Tenant shall pay directly to the providing utility all water,
gas, electric, telephone, and other utilities supplied to the Premises.
Landlord shall not be liable for loss of

                                    Page 8
<PAGE>

or injury to person or property, however occurring, through or in connection
with or incidental to furnishing or the utility company's failure to furnish
utilities to the Premises, and in such event Tenant shall not be entitled to
abatement or reduction of any portion of Base Monthly Rent or any other amount
payable under this Lease.

12.  TOXIC WASTE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE:

    A. Tenant's Responsibility:    Without the prior written consent of
Landlord, Tenant or Tenant's agents, employees, contractors and invitees
("Tenant's Agents") shall not bring, use, or permit upon the Premises, or
generate, create, release, emit, or dispose (nor permit any of the same) from
the Premises any chemicals, toxic or hazardous gaseous, liquid or solid
materials or waste, including without limitation, material or substance having
characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity or
substances or materials which are listed on any of the Environmental Protection
Agency's lists of hazardous wastes or which are identified in Division 22 Title
26 of the California Code of Regulations as the same may be amended from time to
time or any other similar wastes, materials or substances which are or may
become regulated by or under the authority of any applicable local, state or
federal laws, judgments, ordinances, orders, rules, regulations, codes or other
governmental restrictions, guidelines or requirements ("Hazardous Materials")
except for those substances customary in typical office uses for which no
consent shall be required. In order to obtain consent, Tenant shall deliver to
Landlord its written proposal describing the toxic material to be brought onto
the Premises, measures to be taken for storage and disposal thereof, safety
measures to be employed to prevent pollution of the air, ground, surface and
ground water. Landlord's approval may be withheld in its reasonable judgment. In
the event Landlord consents to Tenant's use of Hazardous Materials on the
Premises or such consent is not required, Tenant represents and warrants that it
shall comply with all Governmental Regulations applicable to Hazardous Materials
including doing the following: (i) adhere to all reporting and inspection
requirements imposed by Federal, State, County or Municipal laws, ordinances or
regulations and will provide Landlord a copy of any such reports or agency
inspections; (ii) obtain and provide Landlord copies of all necessary permits
required for the use and handling of Hazardous Materials on the Premises; (iii)
enforce Hazardous Materials handling and disposal practices consistent with
industry standards; (iv) surrender the Premises free from any Hazardous
Materials arising from Tenant's bringing, using, permitting, generating,
creating, releasing, emitting or disposing of Hazardous Materials; and (v)
properly close the facility with regard to Hazardous Materials including the
removal or decontamination of any process piping, mechanical ducting, storage
tanks, containers, or trenches which have come into contact with Hazardous
Materials and obtain a closure certificate from the local administering agency
prior to the Expiration Date. Landlord acknowledges and consents to the storage
on the Premises by Tenant of diesel fuel for Tenant's emergency generators, such
storage to be in above-ground tanks reasonably approved by Landlord.

    B. Tenant's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials: Tenant shall, at its
sole cost and expense, comply with all laws pertaining to, and shall with
counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Landlord and Landlord's trustees, shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
partners, affiliates, and agents from, any claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses incurred or suffered arising from the bringing, using, permitting,
generating, emitting or disposing of Hazardous Materials by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents through the surface soils of the Premises during the Lease Term or the
violation of any Governmental Regulation or environmental law, by Tenant or
Tenant's Agents. Tenant's foregoing indemnification, defense, and hold harmless
obligations include, without limitation, the following: (i) claims, liability,
costs or expenses resulting from or based upon administrative, judicial (civil
or criminal) or other action, legal or equitable, brought by any private or
public person under common law or under the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 as amended ("CERCLA"), the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1980 ("RCRA") or any other federal,
state, county or municipal law, ordinance or regulation now or hereafter in
effect; (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or expenses pertaining to the
identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or removal of Hazardous
Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the provision of an
alternative public drinking water source; (iii) all


                                    Page 9
<PAGE>

costs of defending such claims; (iv) losses attributable to diminution in the
value of the Premises or the Buildings; (v) loss or restriction of use of
rentable space in the Buildings; (vi) adverse effect on the marketing of any
space in the Buildings; and (vi) all other liabilities, obligations, penalties,
fines, claims, actions (including remedial or enforcement actions of any kind
and administrative or judicial proceedings, orders or judgments), damages
(including consequential and punitive damages), and costs (including attorney,
consultant, and expert fees and expenses) resulting from the release or
violation. This Section 12.B shall survive the expiration or termination of this
Lease.

    C. Actual Release by Tenant:    Tenant agrees to notify Landlord of any
lawsuits or orders which relate to the remedying of or actual release of
Hazardous Materials on or into the soils or ground water at or under the
Premises.  Tenant shall also provide Landlord all notices required by Section
25359.7(b) of the Health and Safety Code and all other notices required by law
to be given to Landlord in connection with Hazardous Materials.  Without
limiting the foregoing, Tenant shall also deliver to Landlord, within twenty
(20) days after receipt thereof, any written notices from any governmental
agency alleging a material violation of, or material failure to comply with, any
federal, state or local laws, regulations, ordinances or orders, the violation
of which or failure to comply with poses a foreseeable and material risk of
contamination of the ground water or injury to humans (other than injury solely
to Tenant or Tenant's Agents).

     In the event of any release on or into the Premises or into the soil or
ground water under the Premises, the Buildings or the Project of any Hazardous
Materials used, treated, stored or disposed of by Tenant or Tenant's Agents,
Tenant agrees to comply, at its sole cost, with all laws, regulations,
ordinances and orders of any federal, state or local agency relating to the
monitoring or remediation of such Hazardous Materials.  In the event of any such
release of Hazardous Materials Tenant shall immediately give verbal and follow-
up written notice of the release to Landlord, and Tenant agrees to meet and
confer with Landlord and its Lender to attempt to eliminate and mitigate any
financial exposure to such Lender and resultant exposure to Landlord under
California Code of Civil Procedure Section 736(b) as a result of such release,
and promptly to take reasonable monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps given,
inter alia, the historical uses to which the Property has and continues to be
used, the risks to public health posed by the release, the then available
technology and the costs of remediation, cleanup and monitoring, consistent with
acceptable customary practices for the type and severity of such contamination
and all applicable laws.  Nothing in the preceding sentence shall eliminate,
modify or reduce the obligation of Tenant under 12.B of this Lease to indemnify,
defend and hold Landlord harmless from any claims liabilities, costs or expenses
incurred or suffered by Landlord.  Tenant shall provide Landlord prompt written
notice of Tenant's monitoring, cleanup and remedial steps.

  In the absence of an order of any federal, state or local governmental or
quasi-governmental agency relating to the cleanup, remediation or other response
action required by applicable law, any dispute arising between Landlord and
Tenant concerning Tenant's obligation to Landlord under this Section 12.C
concerning the level, method, and manner of cleanup, remediation or response
action required in connection with such a release of Hazardous Materials shall
be resolved by mediation and/or arbitration pursuant to this Lease.

    D. Environmental Monitoring:     Landlord and its agents shall have the
right to inspect, investigate, sample and monitor the Premises including any
air, soil, water, ground water or other sampling or any other testing, digging,
drilling or analysis to determine whether Tenant is complying with the terms of
this Section 12. If Landlord discovers that Tenant is not in compliance with the
terms of this Section 12, any such costs incurred by Landlord, including
attorneys' and consultants' fees, shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord
within thirty (30) days following Landlord's written demand therefore.

    E. Landlord's Indemnity Regarding Hazardous Materials:    Landlord shall, at
its sole cost and expense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to Tenant,
indemnify, defend, and hold Tenant harmless from any claims, liabilities, costs
or expenses incurred or suffered by Tenant related to the release, existence,
removal, investigation, monitoring or remediation of Hazardous Materials which
are

                                    Page 10
<PAGE>

present or which come to be present on or beneath the Premises except to the
extent the presence of such Hazardous Materials is caused by Tenant or Tenant's
agents.  Landlord's indemnification and hold harmless obligations include,
without limitation, (i) claims, liability, costs or expenses resulting from or
based upon administrative, judicial (civil or criminal) or other action, legal
or equitable, brought by any private or public person under common law or
CERCLA, RCRA, or any other federal, state, county or municipal law, ordinance or
regulation now or hereinafter in effect, (ii) claims, liabilities, costs or
expenses pertaining to the identification, monitoring, cleanup, containment, or
removal of Hazardous Materials from soils, riverbeds or aquifers including the
provision of an alternative public drinking water source, and (iii) all costs of
defending such claims.  In no event shall Landlord be liable for any
consequential damages suffered or incurred by Tenant as a result of any such
contamination.

13.  TENANT'S DEFAULT:    The occurrence of any of the following shall
constitute a default and breach of this Lease by Tenant:  (i) Tenant's failure
to pay the Base Monthly Rent including additional rent or any other payment due
under this Lease within five (5) business days after receipt by Tenant of
written notice from Landlord that such Base Monthly Rent or other payment was
not received when due, (ii) the abandonment of the Premises by Tenant; (iii)
Tenant's failure to observe and perform any other required provision of this
Lease, where such failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice
from Landlord; provided, however, that if the nature of the default is such that
it cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-day period, Tenant shall not be
deemed in default if it commences within such period to cure, and thereafter
diligently prosecutes the same to completion; (iv) Tenant's making of any
general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (v) the filing by or against
Tenant of a petition to have Tenant adjudged a bankrupt or of a petition for
reorganization or arrangement under any law relating to bankruptcy (unless, in
the case of a petition filed against Tenant, the same is dismissed within sixty
(60) days after the filing); (vi) the appointment of a trustee or receiver to
take possession of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises
or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where possession is not restored to
Tenant within sixty (60) days; or (vii) the attachment, execution or other
judicial seizure of substantially all of Tenant's assets located at the Premises
or of Tenant's interest in this Lease, where such seizure is not discharged
within sixty (60) days.

    A. Remedies:    In the event of any such default by Tenant, then in addition
to other remedies available to Landlord at law or in equity, Landlord shall have
the immediate option to terminate this Lease and all rights of Tenant hereunder
by giving written notice of such intention to terminate.  In the event Landlord
elects to so terminate this Lease, Landlord may recover from Tenant all the
following:  (i) the worth at time of award of any unpaid rent which had been
earned at the time of such termination; (ii) the worth at time of award of the
amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned after termination
until the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss for the same
period that Tenant proves could have been reasonably avoided; (iii) the worth at
time of award of the amount by which the unpaid rent for the balance of the
Lease Term after the time of award exceeds the amount of such rental loss that
Tenant proves could be reasonably avoided; (iv) any other amount necessary to
compensate Landlord for all detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure to
perform its obligations under this Lease, or which in the ordinary course of
things would be likely to result therefrom; including the following:  (x)
expenses for repairing, altering or remodeling the Premises for purposes of
reletting, (y) broker's fees, advertising costs or other expenses of reletting
the Premises, and (z) costs of carrying the Premises such as taxes, insurance
premiums, utilities and security precautions; and (v) at Landlord's election,
such other amounts in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as may be
permitted by applicable California law.  The term "rent", as used herein, is
defined as the minimum monthly installments of Base Monthly Rent and all other
sums required to be paid by Tenant pursuant to this Lease, all such other sums
being deemed as additional rent due hereunder.  As used in (i) and (ii) above,
"worth at the time of award" shall be computed by allowing interest at a rate
equal to the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco plus
five (5%) percent per annum.  As used in (iii) above, "worth at the time of
award" shall be computed by discounting such amount at the discount rate of the
Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco at the time of award plus one (1%)
percent.
<PAGE>

    B. Right to Re-enter:     In the event of any such default by Tenant,
Landlord shall have the right, after terminating this Lease, to re-enter the
Premises and remove all persons and property. Such property may be removed and
stored in a public warehouse or elsewhere at the cost of and for the account of
Tenant, and disposed of by Landlord in any manner permitted by law.

    C. Abandonment:     If Landlord does not elect to terminate this Lease as
provided in Section 13.A or 13.B above, then the provisions of California Civil
Code Section 1951.4, (Landlord may continue the lease in effect after Tenant's
breach and abandonment and recover rent as it becomes due if Tenant has a right
to sublet and assign, subject only to reasonable limitations) as amended from
time to time, shall apply and Landlord may from time to time, without
terminating this Lease, either recover all rental as it becomes due or relet the
Premises or any part thereof for such term or terms and at such rental or
rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as Landlord in its reasonable
discretion may deem advisable, with the right to make alterations and repairs to
the Premises.  In the event that Landlord elects to so relet, rentals received
by Landlord from such reletting shall be applied in the following order to:  (i)
the payment of any indebtedness other than Base Monthly Rent due hereunder from
Tenant to Landlord; (ii) the payment of any cost of such reletting; (iii) the
payment of the cost of any alterations and repairs to the Premises; and (iv) the
payment of Base Monthly Rent due and unpaid hereunder.  The residual rentals, if
any, shall be held by Landlord and applied in payment of future Base Monthly
Rent as the same may become due and payable hereunder.  Landlord shall have the
obligation to market the space but shall have no obligation to relet the
Premises following a default if Landlord has other comparable available space
within the Buildings or Project.  In the event the portion of rentals received
from such reletting which is applied to the payment of rent hereunder during any
month be less than the rent payable during that month by Tenant hereunder, then
Tenant shall pay such deficiency to Landlord immediately upon demand.  Such
deficiency shall be calculated and paid monthly.  Tenant shall also pay to
Landlord, as soon as ascertained, any costs and expenses incurred by Landlord in
such reletting or in making such alterations and repairs not covered by the
rentals received from such reletting.

    D. No Termination:     Landlord's re-entry or taking possession of the
Premises pursuant to 13.B or 13.C shall not be construed as an election to
terminate this Lease unless written notice of such intention is given to Tenant
or unless the termination is decreed by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any reletting without termination by Landlord because of any
default by Tenant, Landlord may at any time after such reletting elect to
terminate this Lease for any such default.

    E. Non-Waiver:   Landlord may accept Tenant's payments without waiving any
rights under this Lease, including rights under a previously served notice of
default. No payment by Tenant or receipt by Landlord of a lesser amount than any
installment of rent due shall be deemed as other than payment on account of the
amount due.  If Landlord accepts payments after serving a notice of default,
Landlord may nevertheless commence and pursue an action to enforce rights and
remedies under the previously served notice of default without giving Tenant any
further notice or demand.  Furthermore, the Landlord's acceptance of rent from
the Tenant when the Tenant is holding over without express written consent does
not convert Tenant's Tenancy from a tenancy at sufferance to a month to month
tenancy. No waiver of any provision of this Lease shall be implied by any
failure of Landlord to enforce any remedy for the violation of that provision,
even if that violation continues or is repeated.  Any waiver by Landlord of any
provision of this Lease must be in writing.  Such waiver shall affect only the
provision specified and only for the time and in the manner stated in the
writing. No delay or omission in the exercise of any right or remedy by Landlord
shall impair such right or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof by
Landlord.  No act or conduct of Landlord, including, without limitation, the
acceptance of keys to the Premises, shall constitute acceptance of the surrender
of the Premises by Tenant before the Expiration Date.  Only written notice from
Landlord to Tenant of acceptance shall constitute such acceptance of surrender
of the Premises.  Landlord's consent to or approval of any act by Tenant which
requires Landlord's consent or approvals shall not be deemed to waive or render
unnecessary Landlord's consent to or approval of any subsequent act by Tenant.

    F. Performance by Landlord:    If Tenant fails to perform any obligation
required under

                                    Page 12
<PAGE>

this Lease or by law or governmental regulation, Landlord in its
sole discretion may, after ten (10) days prior written notice to Tenant, without
waiving any rights or remedies and without releasing Tenant from its obligations
hereunder, perform such obligation, in which event Tenant shall pay Landlord as
additional rent all sums paid by Landlord in connection with such substitute
performance, including interest at the Agreed Interest Rate (as defined in
Section 19.J) within ten (10) days of Landlord's written notice for such
payment.

    G. Habitual Default:    The provisions of Section 13 notwithstanding, the
Parties agree that if Tenant has been in either monetary default or material
non-monetary default (beyond applicable notice and cure periods) in the
performance of any (but not necessarily the same) term or condition of this
Lease for four or more times during any twelve (12) month period during the
Lease Term, then such conduct shall, at the election of the Landlord, represent
a separate event of default which cannot be cured by Tenant.  Tenant
acknowledges that the purpose of this provision is to prevent repetitive
defaults by Tenant, which work a hardship upon Landlord and deprive Landlord of
Tenant's timely performance under this Lease.

14.  LANDLORD'S  LIABILITY:

    A. Limitation on Landlord's Liability:    In the event of Landlord's
failure to perform any of its covenants or agreements under this Lease, Tenant
shall give Landlord written notice of such failure and shall give Landlord
thirty (30) days to cure or commence to cure such failure prior to any claim for
breach or resultant damages, provided, however, that if the nature of the
default is such that it cannot reasonably be cured within the 30-day period,
Landlord shall not be deemed in default if it commences within such period to
cure, and thereafter diligently prosecutes the same to completion. In addition,
upon any such failure by Landlord, Tenant shall give notice by registered or
certified mail to any person or entity with a security interest in the Premises
("Mortgagee") that has provided Tenant with notice of its interest in the
Premises, and shall provide Mortgagee a reasonable opportunity to cure such
failure, including such time to obtain possession of the Premises by power of
sale or judicial foreclosure, if such should prove necessary to effectuate a
cure. Tenant agrees that each of the Mortgagees to whom this Lease has been
assigned is an expressed third-party beneficiary hereof. Tenant waives any right
under California Civil Code Section 1950.7 or any other present or future law to
the collection of any payment or deposit from Mortgagee or any purchaser at a
foreclosure sale of Mortgagee's interest unless Mortgagee or such purchaser
shall have actually received and not refunded the applicable payment or deposit.
Tenant further waives any right to terminate this Lease and to vacate the
Premises on Landlord's default under this Lease, except in the event of a
constructive eviction under law. Tenant's sole remedy on Landlord's default is
an action for damages or injunctive or declaratory relief.

    B. Limitation on Tenant's Recourse:    If Landlord is a corporation, trust,
partnership, joint venture, unincorporated association or other form of business
entity, then (i) the obligations of Landlord shall not constitute personal
obligations of the officers, directors, trustees, partners, joint venturers,
members, owners, stockholders, or other principals or representatives except to
the extent of their interest in the Premises.  Tenant shall have recourse only
to the interest of Landlord in the Premises or for the satisfaction of the
obligations of Landlord and shall not have recourse to any other assets of
Landlord for the satisfaction of such obligations.

    C. Indemnification of Landlord:    As a material part of the consideration
rendered to Landlord, Tenant hereby waives all claims against Landlord for
damages to goods, wares and merchandise, and all other personal property in,
upon or about said Premises and for injuries to persons in or about said
Premises, from any cause arising at any time to the fullest extent permitted by
law, except to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence
of Landlord, and Tenant shall indemnify, defend with counsel reasonably
acceptable to Landlord and hold Landlord, and their shareholders, directors,
officers, trustees, employees, partners, affiliates and agents from any claims,
liabilities, costs or expenses incurred or suffered arising from the use of
occupancy of the Premises or any part of the Project by Tenant or Tenant's
Agents, the acts or omissions of Tenant or Tenant's Agents, Tenant's breach of
this Lease, or any damage or injury to person or property from any cause, except
to the extent caused by the willful misconduct or active negligence of Landlord
or from the failure of

                                    Page 13
<PAGE>

Tenant to keep the Premises in good condition and repair as herein provided,
except to the extent due to the active negligence or willful misconduct of
Landlord. Further, in the event Landlord is made party to any litigation due to
the acts or omission of Tenant and Tenant's Agents, Tenant will indemnify,
defend (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Landlord) and hold Landlord
harmless from any such claim or liability including Landlord's costs and
expenses and reasonable attorney's fees incurred in defending such claims.

15.  DESTRUCTION OF PREMISES:

     A. Landlord's Obligation to Restore: In the event of a destruction of the
Premises during the Lease Term Landlord shall repair the same to a similar
condition to that which existed prior to such destruction.  Such destruction
shall not annul or void this Lease; however, Tenant shall be entitled to a
proportionate reduction of Base Monthly Rent while repairs are being made, such
proportionate reduction to be based upon the extent to which the repairs
interfere with Tenant's business in the Premises, as reasonably determined by
Landlord. In no event shall Landlord be required to replace or restore
Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or Tenant's fixtures or personal property.
With respect to a destruction which Landlord is obligated to repair or may elect
to repair under the terms of this Section, Tenant waives the provisions of
Section 1932, and Section 1933, Subdivision 4, of the Civil Code of the State of
California, and any other similarly enacted statute, and the provisions of this
Section 15 shall govern in the case of such destruction.

    B. Limitations on Landlord's Restoration Obligation: Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 15.A, Landlord shall have no obligation to repair, or
restore the Premises if any of the following occur:  (i) if the repairs cannot
be made within two hundred seventy (270) days from the date of receipt of all
governmental approvals necessary under the laws and regulations of State,
Federal, County or Municipal authorities, as reasonably determined by Landlord,
(ii) if the holder of the first deed of trust or mortgage encumbering the
Buildings elects not to permit the insurance proceeds payable upon damage or
destruction to be used for such repair or restoration, (iii) the damage or
destruction is not fully covered by the insurance (plus any deductible amount)
maintained by Landlord, (iv) the damage or destruction occurs in the last twenty
four (24) months of the Lease Term, (v) Tenant is in default pursuant to the
provisions of Section 13, or (vi) Tenant has vacated the Premises for more than
the immediately preceding one hundred twenty (120) days.  In any such event
Landlord may elect either to complete the repair or restoration, or terminate
this Lease by providing Tenant written notice of its election within sixty (60)
days following the damage or destruction.  Tenant shall also have a right to
terminate this Lease if the repairs cannot be made within two hundred seventy
(270) days from the date of receipt of all governmental approvals necessary
under the laws and regulations of State, Federal, County or Municipal
authorities, by providing Landlord written notice of its election within sixty
(60) days following the damage or destruction.

16.  CONDEMNATION:    If any part of the Premises shall be taken for any public
or quasi-public use, under any statute or by right of eminent domain or private
purchase in lieu thereof, and only a part thereof remains which is susceptible
of occupation hereunder as reasonably determined by Tenant, this Lease shall, as
to the part so taken, terminate as of the day before title vests in the
condemnor or purchaser ("Vesting Date") and Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder
shall be adjusted so that Tenant is required to pay for the remainder of the
Lease Term only such portion of Base Monthly Rent as the value of the part
remaining after such taking bears to the value of the entire Premises prior to
such taking.  If all of the Premises or such part thereof be taken so that there
does not remain a portion susceptible for occupation hereunder as reasonably
determined by Tenant, this Lease shall terminate on the Vesting Date.  If part
or all of the Premises be taken, all compensation awarded upon such taking shall
go to Landlord, and Tenant shall have no claim thereto; except Landlord shall
cooperate with Tenant, without cost to Landlord, to recover compensation for
damage to or taking of any Alterations, Tenant Improvements, or for Tenant's
moving costs, loss of or damage to Tenant's personal property, loss to Tenant
because of interruption of business, Tenant's loss of goodwill, and the value
attributable to any leasehold value for the difference between the market value
of the Premises for the remainder or the term above the value, at the date of
taking, of the rent payable for the remainder of the term.  Tenant will have no
right to pursue a claim based upon

                                    Page 14
<PAGE>

the residual value of the Land after expiration of the term or pursue claims or
retain any award to which Landlord is entitled so as inequitably to diminish
Landlord's award. Tenant hereby waives the provisions of California Code of
Civil Procedures Section 1265.130 and any other similarly enacted statue, and
the provisions of this Section 16 shall govern in the case of a taking.

17.  ASSIGNMENT OR SUBLEASE:

    A. Consent by Landlord:    Except for the AOL Sublease and Hewlett Packard
Sublease or as specifically provided in this Section 17, Tenant may not assign,
sublet, hypothecate, or allow a third party to use the Premises without the
express written consent of Landlord, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.  In the event Tenant desires to assign this Lease or any
interest herein or sublet the Premises or any part thereof, Tenant shall deliver
to Landlord (i) executed counterparts of any agreement and of all ancillary
agreements with the proposed assignee/subtenant, (ii) current financial
statements of the transferee covering the preceding three years, (iii) the
nature of the proposed transferee's business to be carried on in the Premises,
(iv) a statement outlining all consideration to be given on account of the
Transfer, and (v) a current financial statement of Tenant.  Landlord may
condition its approval of any Transfer on receipt of a certification from both
Tenant and the proposed transferee of all consideration to be paid to Tenant in
connection with such Transfer.  At Landlord's request, Tenant shall also provide
additional information reasonably required by Landlord to determine whether it
will consent to the proposed assignment or sublease.  Landlord shall have a
eight (8) business-day period following receipt of all the foregoing within
which to notify Tenant in writing that Landlord elects to: (i) terminate this
Lease in the event the proposed sublease or assignment is for substantially all
of space in the Premises (provided, however, that Landlord shall not have the
right to terminate on any sublease or assignment expiring, including any options
in favor of sublessee/assignee, more than three (3) years prior to the Lease
Expiration Date, including any options under this Lease which have been
exercised by Tenant); (ii) permit Tenant to assign or sublet such space to the
named assignee/subtenant on the terms and conditions set forth in the notice; or
(iii) refuse consent.  If Landlord should fail to notify Tenant in writing of
such election within the 8-business day period, Landlord shall be deemed to have
elected option (ii) above.  In the event Landlord elects option (i) above, this
Lease shall expire with respect to such part of the Premises on the date upon
which the proposed sublease or transfer was to commence, and from such date
forward, Base Monthly Rent and all other costs and charges shall be adjusted
based upon the proportion that the rentable area of the Premises remaining bears
to the total rentable area of the Buildings.  In the event Landlord elects
option (ii) above, Landlord's written consent to the proposed assignment or
sublease shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided and upon the condition
that: (i) the proposed assignee or subtenant is engaged in a business that is
limited to the use expressly permitted under this Lease; (ii) the proposed
assignment or sublease is in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; (iii) the
proposed sublease will not result in there being more than two (2) subtenants
within the Premises at any time during the Lease Term; (iv) Tenant reimburses
Landlord on demand for any reasonable costs that may be incurred by Landlord in
connection with said assignment or sublease, including the costs of making
investigations as to the acceptability of the proposed assignee or subtenant and
legal costs (not to exceed $2,000.00 per occurance) incurred in connection with
the granting of any requested consent; and (v) Tenant shall not have advertised
or publicized in any way the availability of the Premises without prior notice
to Landlord.  In the event all or any one of the foregoing conditions are not
satisfied, Landlord shall be considered to have acted reasonably if it withholds
its consent.

    B. Assignment or Subletting Consideration:    Landlord and Tenant hereby
agree that fifty percent (50%) of any rent or other economic consideration (not
including any payments for Tenant's furniture or other personal property owned
by Tenant, any payment for utilities or for other office services provided by
Tenant); (i) realized by Tenant under any sublease or assignment, or (ii)
realized by any subtenant under any sub-sublease of the Premises, in excess of
the Base Monthly Rent payable hereunder after deducting reasonable subletting
and assignment costs directly related to such sublease or assignment including
lease commissions, attorneys fees, costs of demising or otherwise preparing the
sublease space for occupancy, and the unamortized cost of Alterations applicable
to

                                    Page 15
<PAGE>

the space so sublet or assigned, shall be paid to Landlord. Tenant's obligation
to pay over Landlord's portion of the consideration constitutes an obligation
for additional rent hereunder. The above provisions relating to Landlord's right
to terminate the Lease and relating to the allocation of excess rent are
independently negotiated terms of the Lease which constitute a material
inducement for the Landlord to enter into the Lease, and are agreed by the
Parties to be commercially reasonable. No assignment or subletting by Tenant
shall relieve it of any obligation under this Lease. Any assignment or
subletting which conflicts with the provisions hereof shall be void.

    C. No Release:    Any assignment or sublease shall be made only if and shall
not be effective until the assignee or subtenant shall execute, acknowledge, and
deliver to Landlord an agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to
Landlord, whereby the assignee or subtenant shall assume all the applicable
obligations of this Lease on the part of Tenant to be performed or observed and
shall be subject to all the covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and
conditions in this Lease.  Notwithstanding any such sublease or assignment and
the acceptance of rent by Landlord from any subtenant or assignee, Tenant and
any guarantor shall remain fully liable for the payment of Base Monthly Rent and
additional rent due, and to become due hereunder, for the performance of all the
covenants, agreements, terms, provisions and conditions contained in this Lease
on the part of Tenant to be performed and for all acts and omissions of any
licensee, subtenant, assignee or any other person claiming under or through any
subtenant or assignee that shall be in violation of any of the terms and
conditions of this Lease, and any such violation shall be deemed a violation by
Tenant.  Tenant shall indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless from and
against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorney fees) resulting from any claims that may be made against
Landlord by the proposed assignee or subtenant (except to the extent caused by
Landlord's gross negligence or willful misconduct) or by any real estate brokers
or other persons claiming compensation in connection with the proposed
assignment or sublease.

    D. Reorganization of Tenant:    The provisions of this Section 17.D shall
apply if Tenant is a corporation and: (i) there is a dissolution, merger,
consolidation, or other reorganization of or affecting Tenant, where Tenant is
not the surviving corporation, or (ii) there is a sale or transfer to one person
or entity (or to any group of related persons or entities) of stock possessing
more than 50% of the total combined voting power of all classes of Tenant's
capital stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote for the election of
directors, and after such sale or transfer of stock Tenant's stock is no longer
publicly traded. In a transaction under clause (i) the surviving corporation
shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement in form reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord under which such surviving corporation assumes the
obligations of Tenant hereunder, and in a transaction under clause (ii) the
transferee or buyer shall promptly execute and deliver to Landlord an agreement
in form reasonably satisfactory to Landlord under which such transferee or buyer
assumes the obligations of Tenant under the Lease.

    E. Permitted Transfers:    Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Section 17, so long as Tenant otherwise complies with the provisions of this
Article, Tenant may enter into any of the following transfers (a "Permitted
Transfer") without Landlord's prior consent, and Landlord shall not be entitled
to terminate the Lease or to receive any part of any subrent resulting therefrom
that would otherwise be due pursuant to Sections 17.A and 17.B. Tenant may
sublease all or part of the Premises or assign its interest in this Lease to (i)
any corporation which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with the original Tenant to this Lease by means of an ownership interest of more
than 50%; (ii) a corporation which results from a merger, consolidation or other
reorganization in which Tenant is not the surviving corporation, so long as the
surviving corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is
equal to or greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such
transaction; and (iii) a corporation which purchases or otherwise acquires all
or substantially all of the assets of Tenant so long as such acquiring
corporation has a net worth at the time of such assignment that is equal to or
greater than the net worth of Tenant immediately prior to such transaction.

    F. Effect of Default:    In the event of Tenant's default, Tenant hereby
assigns all rents due from any assignment or subletting to Landlord as security
for performance of its

                                    Page 16
<PAGE>

obligations under this Lease, and Landlord may collect such rents as Tenant's
Attorney-in-Fact, except that Tenant may collect such rents unless a default
occurs as described in Section 13 above. A termination of the Lease due to
Tenant's default shall not automatically terminate an assignment or sublease
then in existence; rather at Landlord's election, such assignment or sublease
shall survive the Lease termination, the assignee or subtenant shall attorn to
Landlord, and Landlord shall undertake the obligations of Tenant under the
sublease or assignment; except that Landlord shall not be liable for prepaid
rent, security deposits or other defaults of Tenant to the subtenant or
assignee, or for any acts or omissions of Tenant and Tenant's Agents.

    G. Conveyance by Landlord:    As used in this Lease, the term "Landlord" is
defined only as the owner for the time being of the Premises, so that in the
event of any sale or other conveyance of the Premises or in the event of a
master lease of the Premises, Landlord shall be entirely freed and relieved of
all its covenants and obligations hereunder, and it shall be deemed and
construed, without further agreement between the Parties and the purchaser at
any such sale or the master tenant of the Premises, that the purchaser or master
tenant of the Premises has assumed and agreed to carry out any and all covenants
and obligations of Landlord hereunder.  Such transferor shall transfer and
deliver Tenant's security deposit to the purchaser at any such sale or the
master tenant of the Premises, and thereupon the transferor shall be discharged
from any further liability in reference thereto.

    F. Successors and Assigns:    Subject to the provisions this Section 17, the
covenants and conditions of this Lease shall apply to and bind the heirs,
successors, executors, administrators and assigns of all Parties hereto; and all
Parties hereto comprising Tenant shall be jointly and severally liable
hereunder.

18.  OPTION TO EXTEND THE LEASE TERM:

    A. Grant and Exercise of Option:    Landlord grants to Tenant, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 18.A, two (2) options (the
"Options") to extend the Lease Term for an additional term (the "Option Term").
Each Option Term shall be for a period of sixty (60) months and shall be
exercised, if at all, by written notice to Landlord no later than nine (9)
months prior to the date the Lease Term would expire but for such exercise, time
being of the essence for the giving of such notice. If Tenant exercises the
Option, all of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease except for the
grant of additional Options pursuant to this Section, provided that Base Monthly
Rent for the Premises payable by Tenant during the Option Term shall be the
greater of (i) the Base Monthly Rent applicable to the period immediately prior
to the commencement of the Option Term, and (ii) ninety five percent (95%) of
the Fair Market Rental as hereinafter defined. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, if Tenant is in monetary or material non-monetary default under
any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Lease (beyond applicable cure
periods) either at the time Tenant exercises the Option or at any time
thereafter prior to the commencement date of the Option Term, then Landlord
shall have, in addition to all of Landlord's other rights and remedies provided
in this Lease, the right to terminate the Option upon notice to Tenant, in which
event the Lease Term shall not be extended pursuant to this Section 18.A. As
used herein, the term "Fair Market Rental" is defined as the rental and all
other monetary payments, including any escalations and adjustments thereto
(including without limitation Consumer Price Indexing) that Landlord could
obtain during the Option Term from a third party desiring to lease the Premises,
based upon the current use and other potential uses of the Premises, as
determined by the rents then being obtained for new leases of space comparable
in age and quality to the Premises in the same real estate submarket as the
Buildings. The appraisers shall be instructed that the foregoing five percent
(5%) discount is intended to offset comparable rents that include the following
costs which Landlord will not incur in the event Tenant exercises its option (i)
brokerage commissions, (ii) tenant improvement allowances, (iii) building
improvement costs, and (iv) vacancy costs.

    B. Determination of Fair Market Rental:    If Tenant exercises the Option,
Landlord shall send Tenant notice no later than two hundred forty (240) days
before to the Lease Expiration Date setting forth the Fair Market Rental for the
Option Term. If Tenant disputes Landlord's determination of Fair Market Rental
for the Option Term, Tenant shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of
Landlord's notice setting forth Fair Market Rental for the Option Term,

                                    Page 17
<PAGE>

send to Landlord a notice stating that Tenant either elects to terminate its
exercise of the Option, in which event the Option shall lapse and this Lease
shall terminate on the Expiration Date, or that Tenant disagrees with Landlord's
determination of Fair Market Rental for the Option Term and elects to resolve
the disagreement as provided in Section 18.C below. If Tenant does not send
Landlord a notice as provided in the previous sentence, Landlord's determination
of Fair Market Rental shall be the basis for computing the Base Monthly Rent
payable by Tenant during the Option Term. If Tenant elects to resolve the
disagreement as provided in Section 18.C and such procedures are not concluded
prior to the commencement date of the Option Term, Tenant shall pay to Landlord
as Base Monthly Rent ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as
determined by Landlord in the manner provided above. If the Fair Market Rental
as finally determined pursuant to Section 18.C is greater than Landlord's
determination, Tenant shall pay Landlord the difference between the amount paid
by Tenant and ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so
determined in Section 18.C within thirty (30) days after such determination. If
the Fair Market Rental as finally determined in Section 18.C is less than
Landlord's determination, the difference between the amount paid by Tenant and
ninety five percent (95%) of the Fair Market Rental as so determined in Section
18.C shall be credited against the next installments of Base Monthly Rent due
from Tenant to Landlord hereunder.
    C.   Resolution of a Disagreement over the Fair Market Rental:    Any
disagreement regarding Fair Market Rental shall be resolved as follows:

        1.  Within thirty (30) days after Tenant's response to Landlord's notice
setting forth the Fair Market Rental, Landlord and Tenant shall meet at a
mutually agreeable time and place, in an attempt to resolve the disagreement.

        2.  If within the 30-day period referred to above, Landlord and Tenant
cannot reach agreement as to Fair Market Rental, each party shall select one
appraiser to determine Fair Market Rental.  Each such appraiser shall arrive at
a determination of Fair Market Rental and submit their conclusions to Landlord
and Tenant within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the 30-day
consultation period described above.

        3.  If only one appraisal is submitted within the requisite time period,
it shall be deemed as Fair Market Rental. If both appraisals are submitted
within such time period and the two appraisals so submitted differ by less than
ten percent (10%), the average of the two shall be deemed as Fair Market Rental.
If the two appraisals differ by more than 10%, the appraisers shall immediately
select a third appraiser who shall, within thirty (30) days after his selection,
make and submit to Landlord and Tenant a determination of Fair Market Rental.
This third appraisal will then be averaged with the closer of the two previous
appraisals and the result shall be Fair Market Rental.

        4.  All appraisers specified pursuant to this Section shall be members
of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers with not less than ten (10)
years experience appraising office and industrial properties in the Santa Clara
Valley. Each party shall pay the cost of the appraiser selected by such party
and one-half of the cost of the third appraiser.

    D. Personal to Tenant:    All Options provided to Tenant in this Lease are
personal and granted to VeriSign, Inc. (and any permitted transferee pursuant to
Section 17.E. above) and are not exercisable by any third party should Tenant
assign or sublet all or a portion of its rights under this Lease, unless
Landlord consents to permit exercise of any option by any assignee or subtenant,
in Landlord's sole and absolute discretion.  In the event Tenant has multiple
options to extend this Lease, a later option to extend the Lease cannot be
exercised unless the prior option has been properly exercised.

19.  GENERAL PROVISIONS:

    A. Attorney's Fees:    In the event a suit or alternative form of dispute
resolution is brought for the possession of the Premises, for the recovery of
any sum due hereunder, to interpret the Lease, or because of the breach of any
other covenant herein; then the losing party shall pay to the prevailing party
reasonable attorney's fees including the expense of expert witnesses,
depositions and court testimony as part of its costs which shall be deemed to
have accrued on the commencement of such action.  The prevailing party shall
also be entitled to recover


                                    Page 18
<PAGE>

all costs and expenses including reasonable attorney's fees incurred in
enforcing any judgment or award against the other party. The foregoing provision
relating to post-judgment costs is severable from all other provisions of this
Lease.

    B. Authority of Parties:   Tenant represents and warrants that it is duly
formed and in good standing, and is duly authorized to execute and deliver this
Lease on behalf of said corporation, in accordance with a duly adopted
resolution of the Board of Directors of said corporation or in accordance with
the by-laws of said corporation, and that this Lease is binding upon said
corporation in accordance with its terms.  At Landlord's request, Tenant shall
provide Landlord with corporate resolutions or other proof in a form acceptable
to Landlord, authorizing the execution of the Lease.

    C. Brokers:    Tenant represents it has not utilized or contacted a real
estate broker or finder with respect to this Lease other than Cornish & Carey
Commercial and Tenant agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Landlord harmless
against any claim, cost, liability or cause of action asserted by any other
broker or finder claiming through Tenant.

    D. Choice of Law:    This Lease shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with California law.   Except as provided in Section 19.E, venue
shall be Santa Clara County.

    E. Dispute Resolution:   Landlord and Tenant and any other party that may
become a party to this Lease or be deemed a party to this Lease including any
subtenants agree that, except for any claim by Landlord for unlawful detainer or
any claim within the jurisdiction of the small claims court (which small claims
court shall be the sole court of competent jurisdiction), any controversy,
dispute, or claim of whatever nature arising out of, in connection with or in
relation to the interpretation, performance or breach of this Lease, including
any claim based on contract, tort, or statute, shall be resolved at the request
of any party to this agreement through a two-step dispute resolution process
administered by J.A.M.S. or another judicial mediation service mutually
acceptable to the parties located in Santa Clara County, California. The dispute
resolution process shall involve first, mediation, followed, if necessary, by
final and binding arbitration administered by and in accordance with the then
existing rules and practices of J.A.M.S. or other judicial mediation service
selected. In the event of any dispute subject to this provision, either party
may initiate a request for mediation and the parties shall use reasonable
efforts to promptly select a J.A.M.S. mediator and commence the mediation. In
the event the parties are not able to agree on a mediator within thirty (30)
days, J. A. M. S. or another judicial mediation service mutually acceptable to
the parties shall appoint a mediator. The mediation shall be confidential and in
accordance with California Evidence Code (S) 1119 et. seq. The mediation shall
be held in Santa Clara County, California and in accordance with the existing
rules and practice of J. A. M. S. (or other judicial and mediation service
selected). The parties shall use reasonable efforts to conclude the mediation
within sixty (60) days of the date of either party's request for mediation. The
mediation shall be held prior to any arbitration or court action (other than a
claim by Landlord for unlawful detainer or any claim within the jurisdiction of
the small claims court which are not subject to this mediation/arbitration
provision and may be filed directly with a court of competent jurisdiction).
Should the prevailing party in any dispute subject to this Section 19.E attempt
an arbitration or a court action before attempting to mediate, the prevailing
party shall not be entitled to attorney's fees that might otherwise be available
to them in a court action or arbitration and in addition thereto, the party who
is determined by the arbitrator to have resisted mediation, shall be sanctioned
by the arbitrator or judge.

IF A MEDIATION IS CONDUCTED BUT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, IT SHALL BE FOLLOWED BY FINAL
AND BINDING ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE THEN EXISTING
RULES AND PRACTICES OF J.A.M.S. OR THE OTHER JUDICIAL AND MEDIATION SERVICE
SELECTED, AND JUDGMENT UPON ANY AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR(S) MAY BE
ENTERED BY ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION THEREOF AS PROVIDED BY
CALIFORNIA CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 1280 ET. SEQ, AS SAID STATUTES THEN
APPEAR, INCLUDING ANY AMENDMENTS TO SAID STATUTES OR SUCCESSORS TO SAID STATUTES
OR AMENDED STATUTES, EXCEPT THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PARTIES BE ENTITLED TO
PROPOUND INTERROGATORIES OR REQUEST FOR

    F. Entire Agreement:    This Lease and the exhibits attached hereto contains
all of the agreements and conditions made between the Parties hereto and may not
be modified orally or in any other manner other than by written agreement signed
by all parties hereto or their respective successors in interest.  This Lease

following purposes:  (i) inspecting and maintaining the Premises; (ii) making
repairs, alterations or additions to the Premises; (iii) erecting additional
building(s) and improvements on the land where the Premises are situated or on
adjacent land owned by Landlord; (iv) performing any obligations of Landlord
under the Lease including remediation of Hazardous Materials if determined to be
the responsibility of Landlord, (v) posting and keeping posted thereon notices
of non-responsibility for any construction, alteration or repair thereof, as
required or permitted by any law, and (vi) showing the Premises to Landlord's or
the Master Landlord's existing or potential successors, purchaser, tenants and
lenders.  Tenant shall permit Landlord and his agents, at any time within one
hundred eighty (180) days prior to the Expiration Date (or at any time during
the Lease if Tenant is in default hereunder), to place upon the Premises "For
Lease" signs and exhibit the Premises to real estate brokers and prospective
tenants at reasonable hours.

    H. Estoppel Certificates:    At any time during the Lease Term, each party
(the "Responding Party") shall, within ten (10) business days following written
notice from the other party (the "Requesting Party"), execute and deliver to the
Requesting Party a written statement certifying, if true, the following:  (i)
that this Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or, if modified,
stating the nature of such modification); (ii) the date to which rent and other
charges are paid in advance, if any; (iii) acknowledging that there are not, to
Responding Party's knowledge, any uncured defaults on Requesting Party's part
hereunder (or specifying such defaults if they are claimed); and (iv) such other
information as Requesting Party may reasonably request.  Any such statement may
be conclusively relied upon by any prospective purchaser or encumbrancer of
Requesting Party's interest in the Premises.  The Responding Party's failure to
deliver such statement within such time shall be conclusive upon the Responding
Party that this Lease is in full force and effect without modification, except

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>

as may be represented by the Requesting Party, and that there are no uncured
defaults in Requesting Party's performance. Tenant agrees to provide, within
five (5) days of Landlord's request, Tenant's most recent three (3) years of
audited financial statements for Landlord's use in financing or sale of the
Premises or Landlord's interest therein.

    I. Exhibits:    All exhibits referred to are attached to this Lease and
incorporated by reference.

    J. Interest:    All rent due hereunder, if not paid when due, shall bear
interest at the rate of the Reference Rate published by Bank of America, San
Francisco Branch, plus two percent (2%) per annum from that date until paid in
full ("Agreed Interest Rate").  This provision shall survive the expiration or
sooner termination of the Lease.  Despite any other provision of this Lease, the
total liability for interest payments shall not exceed the limits, if any,
imposed by the usury laws of the State of California.  Any interest paid in
excess of those limits shall be refunded to Tenant by application of the amount
of excess interest paid against any sums outstanding in any order that Landlord
requires.  If the amount of excess interest paid exceeds the sums outstanding,
the portion exceeding those sums shall be refunded in cash to Tenant by
Landlord.  To ascertain whether any interest payable exceeds the limits imposed,
any non-principal payment (including late charges) shall be considered to the
extent permitted by law to be an expense or a fee, premium, or penalty rather
than interest.

    K. This section intentionally left blank.

    L. No Presumption Against Drafter:    Landlord and Tenant understand, agree
and acknowledge that this Lease has been freely negotiated by both Parties; and
that in any controversy, dispute, or contest over the meaning, interpretation,
validity, or enforceability of this Lease or any of its terms or conditions,
there shall be no inference, presumption, or conclusion drawn whatsoever against
either party by virtue of that party having drafted this Lease or any portion
thereof.

    M. Notices:    All notices, demands, requests, or consents required to be
given under this Lease shall be sent in writing by U.S. certified mail, return
receipt requested, or by personal delivery addressed to the party to be notified
at the address for such party specified in Section 1 of this Lease, or to such
other place as the party to be notified may from time to time designate by at
least fifteen (15) days prior notice to the notifying party.  When this Lease
requires service of a notice, that notice shall satisfy rather than supplement
any similar statutorily required notice, including any notice required by Code
of Civil Procedure Section 1161 or any similar or successor statute.  When a
statute requires service of a notice in a particular manner, service of such
notice in the manner described in the first sentence of this Section 19.M. shall
satisfy such statutory requirement.

    N. Property Management:    In addition, Tenant agrees to pay Landlord along
with the expenses to be reimbursed by Tenant a monthly fee for management
services rendered by either Landlord or a third party manager engaged by
Landlord (which may be a party affiliated with Landlord), in the amount of three
percent (3%) of the Base Monthly Rent.

    O. Rent:    All monetary sums due from Tenant to Landlord under this Lease,
including, without limitation those referred to as "additional rent", shall be
deemed as rent.

    P. Representations:    Tenant acknowledges that neither Landlord nor any of
its employees or agents have made any agreements, representations, warranties or
promises with respect to the Premises or with respect to present or future
rents, expenses, operations, tenancies or any other matter.  Except as herein
expressly set forth herein, Tenant relied on no statement of Landlord or its
employees or agents for that purpose.

    Q. Rights and Remedies:    Subject to Section 14 above, All rights and
remedies hereunder are cumulative and not alternative to the extent permitted by
law, and are in addition to all other rights and remedies in law and in equity.

    R. Severability:    If any term or provision of this Lease is held
unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
the Lease shall not be invalidated thereby but shall be enforceable in
accordance with its terms, omitting the invalid or unenforceable term.

    S. Submission of Lease:    Submission of this document for examination or
signature by the parties does not constitute an option or offer

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>

to lease the Premises on the terms in this document or a reservation of the
Premises in favor of Tenant. This document is not effective as a lease or
otherwise until executed and delivered by both Landlord and Tenant.

    T. Subordination:    This Lease is subject and subordinate to ground and
underlying leases, mortgages and deeds of trust (collectively "Encumbrances")
which may now affect the Premises, to any covenants, conditions or restrictions
of record, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and
extensions thereof; provided, however, if the holder or holders of any such
Encumbrance ("Holder") require that this Lease be prior and superior thereto,
within seven (7) days after written request of Landlord to Tenant, Tenant shall
execute, have acknowledged and deliver all documents or instruments, in the
commercially reasonable form presented to Tenant, which Landlord or Holder deems
necessary or desirable for such purposes.  Landlord shall have the right to
cause this Lease to be and become and remain subject and subordinate to any and
all Encumbrances which are now or may hereafter be executed covering the
Premises or any renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements or
extensions thereof, for the full amount of all advances made or to be made
thereunder and without regard to the time or character of such advances,
together with interest thereon and subject to all the terms and provisions
thereof; provided only, that in the event of termination of any such lease or
upon the foreclosure of any such mortgage or deed of trust, Holder agrees to
recognize Tenant's rights under this Lease as long as Tenant is not in default
either at the time Holder recognizes such rights or at any time thereafter.
Within ten (10) business days after Landlord's written request, Tenant shall
execute any documents in commercially reasonable form required by Landlord or
the Holder to make this Lease subordinate to any lien of the Encumbrance,
provided that within those documents the Tenant's rights under this Lease are
recognized only as long as Tenant is not in default.  If Tenant fails to do so,
then in addition to such failure constituting a default by Tenant, it shall be
deemed that this Lease is so subordinated to such Encumbrance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section, Tenant hereby attorns and agrees to
attorn to any entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring the Premises at any sale
or other proceeding or pursuant to the exercise of any other rights, powers or
remedies under such encumbrance.

Landlord shall cause the existing lender to furnish to Tenant, within sixty (60)
days of the date of both parties' execution of this Lease, with a written
agreement providing for (i) recognition by the lender of all of the terms and
conditions of this Lease; and (ii) continuation of this Lease upon foreclosure
of existing lender's security interest in the Premises.  In the event that
Landlord is unable to provide such agreement, Tenant's sole remedy shall be
termination of the Lease, which election shall be made within fourteen (14) days
following the expiration of such sixty (60) day period.

    U. Survival of Indemnities:  All indemnification, defense, and hold harmless
obligations of Landlord and Tenant under this Lease shall survive the expiration
or sooner termination of the Lease.

    V. Time:    Time is of the essence hereunder.

    W. Transportation Demand Management Programs:  Should a government agency or
municipality require Landlord to institute TDM (Transportation Demand
Management) facilities and/or programs, Tenant agrees that the cost of TDM
imposed facilities and programs required on the Premises, including but not
limited to employee showers, lockers, cafeteria, or lunchroom facilities, shall
be paid by Tenant.  Further, any ongoing costs or expenses associated with a TDM
program which are required for the Premises and not provided by Tenant, such as
an on-site TDM coordinator, shall be provided by Landlord with such costs being
included as additional rent and reimbursed to Landlord by Tenant within thirty
(30) days after demand. If TDM facilities and programs are instituted on a
Project wide basis, Tenant shall pay its proportionate share of such costs in
accordance with Section 8 above.

    X. Waiver of Right to Jury Trial:    Landlord and Tenant waive their
respective rights to trial by jury of any contract or tort claim, counterclaim,
cross-complaint, or cause of action in any action, proceeding, or hearing
brought by either party against the other on any matter arising out of or in any
way connected with this Lease, the relationship of Landlord and Tenant, or
Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises, including any claim of injury or

                                    Page 22
<PAGE>

damage or the enforcement of any remedy under any current or future law,
statute, regulation, code, or ordinance.

    Y. Recordation:    A short form Memorandum of Lease, in form and content
reasonably acceptable to the parties, will be executed in recordable form by
each party following execution of this Lease, delivered to Tenant, and may be
recorded by Tenant at its expense.

20.  RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER TO PURCHASE:

    A.  Grant and Exercise of Option:    In the event Landlord elects to sell
the Buildings either separately or as part of a larger sale including other
building(s) within the Project ("Offered Property"), Landlord (referred to
hereinafter in this Section 20 as "Seller") hereby grants Tenant a right of
first offering to purchase.  Prior to Seller committing to sell its interest in
the Offered Property to a third party, Seller shall give Tenant written notice
of such desire and the terms and other information under which Seller intends to
sell the Offered Property.  Provided at the time of such written notice:  (i)
Tenant leases at least two buildings within the Project; and (ii) Tenant is not
in default under the Lease beyond the expiration of any applicable cure period,
Tenant shall have the option, which must be exercised, if at all, by written
notice to Seller within fifteen (15) days after Tenant's receipt of Seller's
notice, to purchase Seller's interest in the Offered Property at the sales price
and terms of sale specified in the notice.  In the event Tenant timely exercises
such option to purchase its interest in the Offered Property, Seller shall sell
its interest in the Offered Property to Tenant, and Tenant shall purchase its
interest in the Offered Property from Seller in accordance with the price and
terms specified in Seller's notice.  Seller and Tenant shall, in good faith,
attempt to reach agreement on the terms of a mutually acceptable purchase
agreement consistent with the terms set forth in Seller's notice within thirty
(30) days of Tenant's exercise of its option to purchase.  In the event either:
(i) Tenant fails to exercise Tenant's option within said 15-day period; or (ii)
after Tenant's exercise, Seller and Tenant are unable to reach agreement on a
mutually acceptable purchase agreement within the subsequent 30-day period;
Seller shall have one hundred eighty (180) days thereafter to sell its interest
in the Offered Property at no less than ninety percent (90%) of the sales price
and upon substantially the same other terms of sale as specified in the notice
to Tenant.  In the event Seller fails to sell its interest in the Offered
Property within said one hundred eighty (180) day period or in the event Seller
proposes to sell its interest in the Offered Property at less than ninety
percent (90%) of the sales price or on other material terms which are more
favorable to the prospective buyer than that proposed to Tenant, Seller shall be
required to resubmit such offer to Tenant in accordance with this Right of First
Offering except that Tenant shall be required to respond to any resubmission
within a seven (7) day period.

    B.  Exclusions:    This Right of First Offering shall automatically
terminate (i) upon the expiration or sooner termination of the Lease, or (ii) in
the event of a foreclosure or other involuntary transfer of Landlord's interest
in the Buildings.  Further, this Right of First Offering shall not apply to
transfers (but shall survive such transfers) of all or a portion of the
Buildings or Project to (i) John A. Sobrato and/or John M. Sobrato (individually
and collectively "Sobrato"), (ii) any immediate family member of Sobrato, (iii)
any trust established, in whole or in part, for the benefit of Sobrato and/or
any immediate family member of Sobrato, (iv) any partnership in which Sobrato or
any immediate family member, either directly or indirectly (e.g., through a
partnership or corporate entity or a trust) retains a general partner interest,
and/or (v) any corporation under the control, either directly or indirectly, by
Sobrato or any immediate family member of Sobrato.
