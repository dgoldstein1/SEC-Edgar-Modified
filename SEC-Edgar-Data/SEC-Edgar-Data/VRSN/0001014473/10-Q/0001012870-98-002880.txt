                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
                          SEPTEMBER 30, 1998 AND 1997
 
(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION
 
  The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated balance sheets and
statements of operations and cash flows reflect all normal recurring
adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair
presentation of the financial position of VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign" or the
"Company") at September 30, 1998, and the results of operations and cash flows
for the interim periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997.
 
  The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and,
therefore, do not include all information and footnotes necessary for a
complete presentation of the Company's results of operations, financial
position and cash flows. The Company filed audited consolidated financial
statements that included all information and footnotes necessary for such a
presentation for the period from April 12, 1995 (inception) to December 31,
1995, and for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31,
1997, in the Company's Prospectus, dated January 29, 1998, filed as part of a
Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-40789), as amended, in connection
with the Company's initial public offering ("IPO").
 
  The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of the results of the Company's operations for any other future
interim period or for a full fiscal year.
 
(2) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
  On January 30, 1998, the Company completed its IPO issuing 3,450,000 shares
of its Common Stock (including 450,000 shares issued upon the exercise of the
underwriters' over-allotment option) at an initial public offering price of
$14 per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the offering, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses
incurred by the Company, were approximately $43.7 million. Concurrently with
the IPO, each outstanding share of the Company's Convertible Preferred Stock
was automatically converted into one share of Common Stock.
 
(3) BUSINESS COMBINATION
 
  In July 1998, VeriSign completed a merger with SecureIT, Inc. ("SecureIT")
(hereafter collectively referred to as the "Company") by exchanging
approximately 1,666,000 shares of its common stock for all of the outstanding
common stock of SecureIT. Each share of SecureIT was exchanged for 0.164806 of
one share of VeriSign common stock. In addition, outstanding SecureIT employee
stock options were converted at the same exchange ratio into options to
purchase approximately 190,000 shares of VeriSign common stock.
 
  The merger constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for
as a pooling-of-interests under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16,
"Business Combinations." Accordingly, all prior period consolidated financial
statements have been restated to include the combined results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of SecureIT as though it had always been a
part of VeriSign. In connection with the restatement, there were no
transactions between VeriSign and SecureIT prior to the combination requiring
elimination and there were no material adjustments required to conform
SecureIT's accounting policies.

</TABLE>
 
  In connection with the merger, the Company recorded in the third quarter a
special charge to operating expenses of $3.6 million for direct and other
merger-related costs pertaining to the merger transaction and certain stock-
based compensation charges. Merger transaction costs consisted primarily of
fees for investment bankers, attorneys and accountants, filing fees and other
related charges. The stock-based compensation charges related to certain
performance stock options held by Secure IT employees whose vesting
accelerated upon change of control.
 
(4) REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
  For software transactions entered into after January 1, 1998, the Company
adopted the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' ("AICPA")
Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." SOP
No. 97-2 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving
multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on its relative fair
value. The fair value of the element must be based on objective evidence that
is specific to the vendor. If a vendor does not have objective evidence of the
fair value of all elements in a multiple-element arrangement, all revenue from
the arrangement must be deferred until such evidence exists or until all
elements have been delivered. The adoption of SOP No. 97-2 did not have a
material effect on the Company's operating results.
 
(5) NET LOSS PER SHARE
 
  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average
number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss)
per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and dilutive
common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Antidilutive common
equivalent shares excluded from basic and diluted loss per share for the
three-month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997 were comprised of common
stock options, which totaled 2,221,789 and 1,201,878, with a weighted-average
exercise price of $7.73 and $1.08, respectively, and the weighted average
number of convertible preferred stock shares outstanding during the three-
month period ended September 30, 1997, which totaled 10,031,006. For the nine-
month periods ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, the antidilutive common
equivalent shares excluded from basic and diluted loss per share were
comprised of common stock options, which totaled 2,279,922 and 1,158,854, with
a weighted-average exercise price of $4.99 and $.89, respectively, and the
weighted-average number of convertible preferred stock shares outstanding
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 1997, which totaled
10,031,006.

(6) COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
 
  Effective January 1, 1998, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for the display of comprehensive
income and its components in a full set of financial statements. Comprehensive
income includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting
from the issuance of stock and distributions to stockholders. There were no
material differences between the Company's net loss and its comprehensive
loss.
 
(7) RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
  In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP No. 98-1
requires that entities capitalize certain costs related to internal-use
software once certain criteria have been met. The Company expects that the
adoption of SOP No. 98-1 will have no material impact on its financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. The Company will be required to
implement SOP No. 98-1 for the year ending December 31, 1999.
 
  In April 1998, the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of
Start-Up Activities." SOP No. 98-5 requires that all start-up costs related to
new operations must be expensed as incurred. In addition, all start-up costs
that were capitalized in the past must be written off when SOP No. 98-5 is
adopted. The Company expects that the adoption of SOP No. 98-5 will have no
material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. The Company will be required to implement SOP No. 98-5 for the year
ending December 31, 1999.
 
  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133
establishes methods of accounting for derivative financial instruments and
hedging activities related to those instruments as well as other hedging
activities. Because the Company currently holds no derivative instruments and
does not engage in hedging activities, the Company expects that the adoption
of SFAS No. 133 will have no material impact on its financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. The Company will be required to implement
SFAS No. 133 for the year ending December 31, 2000.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
        RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim
unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.
 
  In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statement. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the section below entitled
"Factors That May Affect Future Results Of Operations." Readers should
carefully review the risks described in the other documents that the Company
has filed from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, including its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the Company's
Prospectus dated January 29, 1998. Readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company undertakes no obligation to
publicly release any revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect
events or circumstances after the date of this document.
 
OVERVIEW
 
  VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign" or the "Company") headquartered in Mountain View,
California, is the leading provider of Internet trust services used by
enterprises, Web sites and consumers to conduct secure communications and
transactions over the Internet. The Company's digital certificate and public
key infrastructure ("PKI") solutions enable its customers to deploy secure
intranet, extranet, virtual private network and electronic commerce
applications over IP-based networks.
 
  The Company's products and services generally include enterprise solutions
and Internet services. Enterprise solutions encompass VeriSign's integrated
PKI platform, VeriSign OnSite as well as enterprise security design, training,
certification and consulting. These products and services are available
directly from the Company or through system integrators and global affiliates.
To date, the Company has delivered enterprise PKI solutions to over 220
companies and government agencies including Bank of America, First Union,
Hewlett-Packard, Internal Revenue Service, Kodak, NationsBank, Sumitomo Bank,
Texas Instruments, United Parcel Service and US West. The Company's Internet
services, comprised of its Web site and consumer businesses include Web site
digital certificates, software publisher digital certificates and individual
digital certificates, available directly through the Company's Web site or
through associated Web sites. Since its founding, VeriSign has issued
approximately 82,000 Web site certificates and 3,500,000 individual digital
certificates. The Company has delivered its enterprise solutions and Internet
services in partnership with leading companies including Acer, AT&T, British
Telecommunications, Cisco Systems, Lotus, Lucent Technologies, Microsoft,
Netscape and Network Associates.
 
  VeriSign OnSite is targeted at Fortune 10,000 companies in the financial
services, publishing, legal, transportation and other industries as well as
government agencies and educational institutions. The Company has attracted
220 customers for VeriSign OnSite since its introduction in the last quarter
of 1997. VeriSign OnSite is an integrated platform which links PKI
functionality with mission-critical processing services enabling enterprises
to deploy a highly robust and fully featured digital certificate solution to
secure their intranets, extranets and Internet commerce applications. OnSite
leverages and integrates with widely-deployed browser, e-mail and remote
access applications. This architecture eliminates the requirement that an
enterprise's customers and business partners install, upgrade and maintain
additional proprietary PKI-specific software. In addition, VeriSign OnSite
provides contractually guaranteed non-stop digital certificate processing
services from VeriSign's secure data centers which operate 24 hours a day, 7
days a week.
 
  During the second quarter of 1998, the Company enhanced its OnSite offering
to enable organizations to secure Web servers used in intranets, extranets and
Internet commerce applications. Leveraging the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
protocol, this solution enables enterprises and organizations to control the
issuance and
 
                                      10
<PAGE>
 
administration of multiple server digital certificates within a single domain
name (e.g., www.yourcompany.com) issued either within the globally
interoperable VeriSign Trust Network or under a private certificate hierarchy.
In October 1998, the Company introduced VeriSign OnSite 4.0, which adds
enhanced PKI functionality, new processing services and the ability to
integrate an enterprise's PKI with enterprise applications such as SAP R/3.
 
  In addition to VeriSign's OnSite offerings, the Company also issues Web site
certificates and individual certificates through the VeriSign Digital ID
Center, an online service that is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. VeriSign
has been first to market with digital certificates for servers, browsers, e-
mail applications and software content, and continues to hold a majority of
the market share in these areas.
 
  Historically, the Company has derived substantially all of its revenues from
the sale of digital certificates and from fees for services rendered in
connection with the Company's digital certificate solutions and digital
certificate service and product development agreements. Revenues from the
Company's Enterprise PKI Solutions consist of fees for the issuance of digital
certificates, which are recognizable ratably over the term of the particular
license agreement relating to the enterprise or electronic commerce solution;
fees for software tool kits, which are recognized upon delivery; and fees for
set-up service, which are recognized upon completion of the service. The
purchase of a digital certificate by a consumer or for a Web site allows the
customer to use the digital certificate for a limited period of time,
generally 12 months. After this period, the digital certificate must be
renewed for continued usage by the customer. Renewal fees are typically lower
than the fees charged for the initial digital certificate. Revenues from the
sale or renewal of digital certificates for consumers, for Web sites and from
enterprise certificate fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the life
of the digital certificate. Revenues from other services are recognized using
the percentage-of-completion method for fixed-fee development arrangements, on
a time-and-materials basis for consulting and training services or ratably
over the term of the agreement for support and maintenance services.
 
  The Company markets its products and services worldwide through multiple
distribution channels, including the Internet, direct sales, telesales, VARs,
systems integrators and global affiliates. Although a significant portion of
its revenue to date has been generated through sales from the Company's Web
site, the Company intends to continue increasing its direct sales force, both
domestically and internationally, and intends to continue to expand its other
distribution channels.
 
  In connection with the formation of VeriSign Japan K.K. ("VeriSign Japan")
the Company licensed certain technology and contributed other assets to
VeriSign Japan. Subsequent to its formation, additional investors purchased
minority interests in VeriSign Japan, and, as of September 30, 1998, the
Company owned 50.5% of the outstanding capital stock of VeriSign Japan.
Accordingly, the Company's consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and this subsidiary and the Company's consolidated
statements of operations reflect the elimination of the minority shareholders'
share of the net losses of the subsidiary. Historically, VeriSign Japan has
principally funded its net losses with investments from its minority
shareholders. However, to the extent VeriSign Japan is unable to continue to
fund its operations principally from investments by minority shareholders, the
Company may be required to fund the operations of this subsidiary, which could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results
and financial condition.
 
  In July 1998, the Company acquired SecureIT, Inc. ("SecureIT") of Norcross,
Georgia, a provider of Internet and enterprise security solutions comprising a
full range of products and services to assist clients with assessing,
designing and implementing security solutions. In addition, SecureIT provides
training on related subjects. The acquisition added services and technology
complimentary to the Company's electronic commerce security solutions and
other areas of its product lines. The merger constituted a tax-free
reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling-of-interests.
Accordingly, all prior period consolidated financial statements have been
restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash
flows of SecureIT as though it had always been a part of VeriSign.
 
  The Company has experienced substantial net losses in each fiscal period
since its inception and, as of September 30, 1998, had an accumulated deficit
of $48.3 million. Such net losses and accumulated deficit
 
                                      11
<PAGE>
 
resulted from the Company's lack of substantial revenues and the significant
costs incurred in the development and sale of the Company's products and
services and in the establishment and deployment of the Company's operations,
infrastructure and practices. The Company intends to increase its expenditures
in all areas in order to execute its business plan. As a result, the Company
expects to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Although the
Company has experienced revenue growth in recent periods, there can be no
assurance that such growth rates are sustainable and, therefore, they should
not be considered indicative of future operating results. There can be no
assurance that the Company will ever achieve significant revenues or
profitability. A more complete description of these and other risks relating
to the Company's business is set forth under the caption "Risk Factors" in the
Company's Prospectus dated January 29, 1998.

     Nine-month period:
       Revenues........................................... $25,719 $8,360  208%
</TABLE>
 
  Revenues increased significantly from the prior year due to increased sales
of VeriSign's products and services, particularly its Web site digital
certificates and OnSite products, delivery of training and services, as well
as the sale of third party products. As a result of the continued acceptance
of digital certificates, the number of digital certificates issued continued
to grow on a quarterly basis. The Company has seen year-to-year increases in
the number of customers that are buying consumer and Web site digital
certificates and the number of organizations and government agencies beginning
to deploy digital certificate and PKI solutions and believes that such
increases are attributable to the growing acceptance of digital certificates
as a mechanism for authentication, access control and secure messaging. In
addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 1998, the
Company completed certain work required under various contracts for its
enterprise and electronic commerce solutions and, therefore, recognized the
related portion of revenues.
 
  For software transactions entered into beginning January 1, 1998, the
Company adopted the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants'
Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." SOP
No. 97-2 generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving
multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on its relative fair
value. The fair value of the element must be based on objective evidence that
is specific to the vendor. If a vendor does not have objective evidence of the
fair value of all elements in a multiple-element arrangement, all revenue from
the arrangement must be deferred until such evidence exists or until all
elements have been delivered. The adoption of SOP No. 97-2 did not have a
material effect on the Company's operating results.
 
  No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenues during the three months or
nine months ended September 30, 1998. VISA International accounted for 10% and
12% of revenues for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 1997,
respectively. Revenues of VeriSign Japan and revenue from other international
customers accounted for 12% and 7% of revenues in the third quarters of 1998
and 1997 and 11% and 10% of revenues in the first nine months of 1998 and
1997, respectively.
 
  A portion of the Company's sales are earned later than billed and collected.
Such deferred revenue increased from $5.3 million at December 31, 1997 to
$10.5 million at September 30, 1998.

  Cost of Revenues. Cost of revenues consists primarily of costs related to
personnel providing digital certificate enrollment and issuance services,
customer support and training, consulting and development services and to
facilities and computer equipment used in such activities. Cost of revenues
also includes fees paid to third parties to verify certificate applicants'
identities, insurance premiums for the Company's NetSure warranty plan and
errors and omission insurance, and software resold to customers.
 
  The increase in cost of revenues from 1997 to 1998 was due primarily to
hiring personnel to support the additional volume of issuances of digital
certificates and to support SecureIT's security consulting and training
activities, the cost of the Company's NetSure warranty plan (which was not in
effect in the first three months of 1997), increased expenses for access to
third-party databases, support charges for the Company's external disaster
recovery program, and the significant increased volume and related cost of
software products resold to customers as part of network security solution
implementations.
 
  The Company anticipates that cost of revenues will vary for the remainder of
1998 depending on the product mix sold during that period, as cost of service
revenues is typically higher than cost of product revenues due to the
relatively high personnel costs associated with providing services.

  Sales and marketing expenses increased from 1997 to 1998 as a result of the
continued growth of the Company's direct sales force and an expansion of the
Company's marketing efforts during 1998, particularly in lead and demand
generation activities and as a result of the growth and expansion of the
SecureIT sales and marketing organization. The decrease in sales and marketing
expenses as a percentage of revenues from 1997 to 1998 is primarily due to the
increase in revenues.

  Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist
primarily of costs related to research and development personnel, including
salaries and other personnel-related expenses, consulting fees, facilities and
computer equipment and support services used in product and technology
development.
 
  Research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars as the
Company invested in the design, testing and deployment of, and technical
support for, the Company's expanded product offerings and technology. The
increase reflects the expansion of the Company's engineering staff and related
costs required to support its continued emphasis on developing new products
and services as well as enhancing existing products and services. During 1998,
the Company continued to make significant investments in development of all of
its software products and related platforms supported, including those
targeted for the enterprise and electronic commerce market.
 
  The Company believes that timely development of new and enhanced products
and technology are necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace.
Accordingly, the Company intends to continue recruiting experienced research
and development personnel and make other investments in research and
development. Therefore, the Company expects research and development expenses
will continue to increase in absolute dollars.

  During 1998, the Company incurred increased costs due primarily to increased
staffing levels required to support the Company's expanded operations and to
implement additional management information systems and related procedures. In
addition, the Company has incurred additional costs related to being a public
company, including investor relations programs and professional services fees.

  Special charges. In September 1996, VeriFone, Inc. ("VeriFone"), which
subsequently became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company
("Hewlett-Packard"), filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging, among other
things, trademark infringement. In November 1997, the parties executed a
definitive agreement, under which, among other things, the Company issued an
aggregate of 250,000 shares of common stock, which were transferred to
Hewlett-Packard, and the Company and VeriFone settled such claims. The
settlement amount was recorded during the third quarter of 1997 as a $2.0
million charge to operations.
 
  In connection with the acquisition of SecureIT, the Company recorded in the
third quarter of 1998 a special charge to operating expenses for direct and
other merger-related costs pertaining to the merger transaction and certain
stock-based compensation charges of approximately $2.4 million and $1.2
million, respectively. Merger transaction costs consisted primarily of fees
for investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, filing fees and other related
charges. The stock-based compensation charges related to certain performance
stock options held by Secure IT employees whose vesting accelerated upon
change of control.

  Other income consists primarily of interest earned on the Company's cash,
cash equivalents and short-term investments, less interest expense on bank
borrowings of VeriSign Japan and the effect of foreign currency transaction
gains and losses.
 
  The increase in other income from 1997 to 1998 is primarily due to a higher
cash and short-term investment base as a result of the proceeds from the
Company's initial public offering on January 30, 1998.
 
 Provision for Income Taxes
 
  No provision for federal and California income taxes has been recorded
because the Company has experienced net losses since inception. As of December
31, 1997, the Company had federal and California net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $26.9 million and $27.1 million, respectively.
These federal and California net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if
not utilized, in years 2010 through 2014 and in 2003, respectively.

 Minority Interest in Net Loss of Subsidiary
 
  Minority interest in the net losses of VeriSign Japan was $237,000 and
$407,000 during the third quarters of 1998 and 1997, respectively, and
$950,000 and $1,194,000 during the first nine months of 1998 and 1997,
respectively. The decrease from 1997 to 1998 was primarily due to increased
revenue from VeriSign Japan as compared to the prior year. VeriSign Japan is
still in the early stage of operations and, therefore, the Company expects
that the minority interest in net loss of subsidiary will continue to
fluctuate in future periods.
 
FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
 Limited Operating History; History of Losses and Anticipation of Future
Losses
 
  The Company was incorporated in April 1995 and began introducing its
products and services in June 1995. Accordingly, the Company has only a
limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of its business and
prospects. The Company's prospects must be considered in light of the risks
and uncertainties encountered by companies in the early stages of development,
particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets. The Company's
success will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the
following: the rate and timing of the growth and use of IP networks for
communications and commerce and the extent to which digital certificates are
used for such communications and commerce; the demand for the Company's
products and services; the levels of competition; the perceived security of
communications and commerce over IP networks, and of the Company's
infrastructure, products and services in particular; and the Company's
continued ability to maintain its current, and enter into additional,
strategic relationships. To address these risks the Company must, among other
things: attract and retain qualified personnel; respond to competitive
developments; successfully introduce new products and services; successfully
introduce enhancements to its existing products and services to address new
technologies and standards; and successfully market its digital certificates
and its enterprise and electronic commerce solutions. There can be no
assurance that the Company will succeed in addressing any or all of these
risks, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, operating results and financial condition. In addition,
the Company has experienced substantial net losses in each fiscal period since
its inception and, as of September 30, 1998, had an accumulated deficit of
$48.3 million. Such net losses and accumulated deficit resulted from the
Company's lack of substantial revenues and the significant costs incurred in
the development and sale of the Company's products and services and in the
establishment and deployment of the Company's operations, infrastructure and
practices. The Company's limited operating history, the emerging nature of its
market and the factors described under "--Adoption of IP Networks", among
other factors, make prediction of the Company's future operating results
difficult. In addition, the Company intends to increase its expenditures in
all areas in order to execute its business plan. As a result, the Company
expects to incur substantial additional losses for the foreseeable future.
Furthermore, to the extent the Company's majority-owned subsidiary, VeriSign
Japan, is unable to continue to fund its operations with investments from
minority shareholders, the Company may be required to fund the operations of
VeriSign Japan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, operating results and financial condition. Although the Company has
experienced revenue growth in recent periods, there can be no assurance that
such growth rates are sustainable and, therefore, they should not be
considered indicative of future operating results. There can also be no
assurance that the Company will ever achieve significant revenues or
profitability or, if significant revenues and profitability are achieved, that
they could be sustained.
 
 Adoption of IP Networks
 
  In order for the Company to be successful, IP networks must be adopted as a
means of trusted and secure communications and commerce to a sufficient extent
and within an adequate time frame. Because trusted and secure communications
and commerce over IP networks is new and evolving, it is difficult to predict
with any assurance the size of this market and its growth rate, if any. To
date, many businesses and consumers have been deterred from utilizing IP
networks for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, potentially
inadequate development of network infrastructure, security concerns,
inconsistent quality of service, lack of availability of cost-effective, high-
speed service, limited numbers of local access points for corporate users,
inability to integrate
 
                                      16
<PAGE>
 
business applications on IP networks, the need to interoperate with multiple
and frequently incompatible products, inadequate protection of the
confidentiality of stored data and information moving across IP networks and a
lack of tools to simplify access to and use of IP networks. The adoption of IP
networks for trusted and secure communications and commerce, particularly by
individuals and entities that historically have relied upon traditional means
of communications and commerce, will require a broad acceptance of new methods
of conducting business and exchanging information. Companies and government
agencies that already have invested substantial resources in other methods of
conducting business may be reluctant to adopt a new strategy that may limit or
compete with their existing efforts. Furthermore, individuals with established
patterns of purchasing goods and services and effecting payments may be
reluctant to alter those patterns.
 
  The use of IP networks for trusted and secure communications and commerce
may not increase or may increase more slowly than expected because the
infrastructure required to support widespread trusted and secure
communications and commerce on such networks may not develop. For example, the
Internet has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant growth
in its number of users and amount of traffic. There can be no assurance that
the Internet infrastructure will continue to support the demands placed on it
by this continued growth or that the performance or reliability of the
Internet will not be adversely affected by this continued growth. In addition,
IP networks could lose their viability due to delays in the development or
adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity
or due to increased governmental regulation. Changes in, or insufficient
availability of, communications services to support IP networks could result
in slower response times and also adversely affect usage of IP networks. If
the market for trusted and secure communications and commerce over IP networks
fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected, or if the Internet
infrastructure does not adequately support any continued growth, the Company's
business, operating results and financial condition would be materially
adversely affected.
 
 No Assurance of Market Acceptance for Digital Certificates and the Company's
Products and Services
 
  The Company's products and services are targeted at the market for trusted
and secure communications and commerce over IP networks, a market that is at
an early stage of development and is rapidly evolving. Accordingly, demand for
and market acceptance of digital certificate solutions are subject to a high
level of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that digital certificates will
gain market acceptance as a necessary element of trusted and secure
communications and commerce over IP networks. In addition, there can be no
assurance that the market for the Company's products and services will develop
in a timely manner, or at all, or that demand for the Company's products and
services will emerge or be sustainable. The factors that may affect the level
of market acceptance of digital certificates and, consequently, the Company's
products and services, include the following: market acceptance of products
and services based upon authentication technologies other than those used by
the Company; public perception of the security of digital certificates and of
the inherent security levels of IP networks; the ability of the Internet
infrastructure to accommodate increased levels of usage; and the enactment of
government regulations affecting communications and commerce over IP networks.
Even if digital certificates achieve market acceptance, there can be no
assurance that the Company's products and services will adequately address the
market's requirements. If digital certificates do not achieve market
acceptance in a timely manner and sustain such acceptance, or if the Company's
products and services in particular do not achieve or sustain market
acceptance, the Company's business, operating results and financial condition
would be materially adversely affected.
 
 System Interruption and Security Breaches
 
  The Company's success is largely dependent on the uninterrupted operation of
its Digital ID Centers and its other computer and communications systems,
which is dependent on the Company's ability to protect such systems from loss,
damage or interruption caused by fire, earthquake, power loss,
telecommunications failure or other events beyond the Company's control. Most
of the Company's systems are located at, and most of its customer information
is stored in, its facilities in Mountain View, California and Kawasaki, Japan,
areas susceptible to earthquakes. Although the Company believes that its
existing and planned precautions are adequate
 
                                      17
<PAGE>
 
to prevent any significant loss of information or system outage, there can be
no assurance that unanticipated problems will not cause such loss or failure.
Any damage or failure that causes interruptions in the Company's Digital ID
Centers and its other computer and communications systems could have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and
financial condition. In addition, the ability of the Company to issue digital
certificates is also dependent on the efficient operation of the Internet
connections from customers to its Digital ID Centers. Such connections, in
turn, are dependent upon efficient operation of Web browsers, Internet Service
Providers and Internet backbone service providers, all of which have had
periodic operational problems or experienced outages in the past. Any such
problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction with the
Company's products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on
the Company's business, operating results and financial condition. The
Company's success also depends in large part upon the scaleability of its
systems, which have not been tested at high volumes. As such, it is possible
that a substantial increase in demand for the Company's products and services
could cause interruptions in the Company's systems that could adversely affect
the Company's ability to deliver its products and services. Any such
interruptions could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
operating results and financial condition.
 
  The Company retains certain confidential customer information in its data
centers. It is critical to the Company's business strategy that the Company's
facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that such facilities and
infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Despite the
implementation of security measures, the Company's infrastructure may be
vulnerable to physical break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or
similar disruptive problems, and it is possible that in the future the Company
may have to expend additional financial and other resources to further address
such problems. Any physical or electronic break-ins or other security breaches
or compromises of the private root keys stored at the Company's Digital ID
Centers may jeopardize the security of information stored on the Company's
premises or stored in and transmitted through the computer systems and
networks of the businesses and individuals utilizing the Company's products
and services, which could result in significant liability to the Company and
could deter existing and potential customers from using the Company's products
and services. Such an occurrence could result in adverse publicity and
therefore adversely affect the market's perception of the security of
communications and commerce over IP networks as well as of the security or
reliability of the Company's products and services, which would have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and
financial condition.
 
 Competition
 
  The Company's digital certificate solutions are targeted at the new and
rapidly evolving market for trusted and secure communications and commerce
over IP networks. Although the competitive environment in this market has yet
to develop fully, the Company anticipates that it will be intensely
competitive subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product
and service introductions and other market activities of industry
participants.
 
  The Company's primary competitors are Entrust Technologies, Inc., GTE
CyberTrust Solutions Incorporated and International Business Machines
Corporation. The Company also experiences competition from a number of smaller
companies that provide digital certificate solutions. The Company expects that
competition from established and emerging companies in the financial and
telecommunications industries will increase in the near term, and that the
Company's primary long-term competitors may not yet have entered the market.
Netscape Communications Corporation has introduced software products that
enable the issuance and management of digital certificates, and the Company
believes that other companies could introduce such products. There can be no
assurance that additional companies will not offer digital certificate
solutions that are competitive with those of the Company. Increased
competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced margins or the failure
of the Company's products and services to achieve or maintain market
acceptance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
business, operating results and financial condition.
 
  Several of the Company's current and potential competitors have longer
operating histories and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing
and other resources than the Company and therefore may be able to respond more
quickly than the Company to new or changing opportunities, technologies,
standards and customer
 
                                      18
<PAGE>
 
requirements. Many of these competitors also have broader and more established
distribution channels that may be used to deliver competing products or
services directly to customers through bundling or other means. If such
competitors were to bundle with their products competing products or services
for their customers, the demand for the Company's products and services might
be substantially reduced and the ability of the Company to distribute its
products successfully and the utilization of its services would be
substantially diminished. In addition, browser companies that embed the
Company's root keys or otherwise feature the Company as a provider of digital
certificate solutions in their Web browsers or on their Web sites could also
promote competitors of the Company or charge the Company substantial fees for
such promotions in the future. New technologies and the expansion of existing
technologies may increase the competitive pressures on the Company. There can
be no assurance that competing technologies developed by others or the
emergence of new industry standards will not adversely affect the Company's
competitive position or render its products or technologies noncompetitive or
obsolete. In addition, the market for digital certificates is nascent and is
characterized by announcements of collaborative relationships involving
competitors of the Company. The existence or announcement of such
relationships could adversely affect the Company's ability to attract and
retain customers. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, there can be
no assurance that the Company will compete effectively with current or future
competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the Company will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating results and
financial condition.
 
  In connection with the Company's first round of financing, RSA contributed
certain technology to the Company and entered into a noncompetition agreement
with the Company pursuant to which RSA agreed that it would not compete with
the Company's certificate authority business for a period of five years. This
noncompetition agreement will expire in April 2000. The Company believes that,
because RSA (which is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Security Dynamics
Technologies, Inc.) has already developed expertise in the area of
cryptography, its barriers to entry would be lower than those that would be
encountered by other potential competitors of the Company should it choose to
enter any of the Company's markets. If RSA were to enter into the digital
certificate market, the Company's business, operating results and financial
condition could be materially adversely affected.
 
 Management of Growth and Expansion
 
  The Company is currently experiencing a period of significant expansion. The
Company's historical growth has placed, and such growth and any further growth
is likely to continue to place, a significant strain on the Company's
managerial, operational, financial and other resources. The Company has grown
from 180 employees at September 30, 1997 to 299 employees at September 30,
1998. In addition, the Company has opened additional sales offices and has
significantly expanded its operations during this time period. The Company's
future success will depend, in part, upon the ability of its senior management
to manage growth effectively, which will require the Company to implement
additional management information systems, to develop further its operating,
administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls and to maintain
close coordination among its engineering, accounting, finance, marketing,
sales and operations organizations. Any failure to implement or improve
systems or controls or to manage any future growth and expansion effectively
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, operating
results and financial condition.
 
YEAR 2000 ISSUES
 
 Background of Year 2000 Issues
 
  Many currently installed computer systems and software products are unable
to distinguish between twentieth century dates and twenty-first century dates
because such systems may have been developed using two digits rather than four
to determine the applicable year. For example, computer systems that have
date-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900
rather than the year 2000. This error could result in system failures or
miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other
things, a temporary inability to process transactions, send invoices or engage
in similar normal business activities. As a result, many
 
                                      19
<PAGE>
 
companies' software and computer systems may need to be upgraded or replaced
to comply with such "Year 2000" requirements.
 
 State of Readiness
 
  VeriSign's business is dependent on the operation of numerous systems that
could potentially be impacted by Year 2000 related problems. The systems
include: hardware and software systems used by the Company to deliver products
and services to its customers (including the Company's proprietary software
systems as well as software supplied by third parties); communications
networks such as the Internet and private intranets, which the Company depends
on to carry products and provide services to its customers; the internal
systems of the Company's customers and suppliers; digital certificates and
software products sold to customers; the hardware and software systems used
internally by the Company in the management of its business; and non-
information technology systems and services used by the Company in the
management of its business, such as telephone systems and building systems.
 
  Based on an analysis of the systems potentially impacted by conducting
business in the twenty-first century, the Company is applying a phased
approach to making such systems, and accordingly the Company's operations,
ready for the year 2000. Beyond awareness of the issues and scope of systems
involved, the phases of activities in progress include: an assessment of
specific underlying computer systems, programs and/or hardware; remediation or
replacement of Year 2000 non-compliant technology; validation and testing of
technologically compliant Year 2000 solutions; and implementation of the Year
2000 compliant systems. The table below provides the status and timing of such
phased activities.

</TABLE>
 
  As a trusted third party providing, among other products, digital
certificates and related life cycle services, the Company is dependent on the
hardware and software products from third parties used to deliver such
products and services. Inoperability of such products due to Year 2000 issues
could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results
of results operations. The Company has completed its assessment of the
underlying systems and hardware, certain components have been replaced and the
Company is conducting validation and testing.
 
 Costs to Address Year 2000 Issues
 
  The Company expects that costs directly related to Year 2000 issues will not
exceed approximately $500,000 for both costs incurred to date and future
costs, including cases where non-compliant information technology systems have
been replaced. The replacement cost of non-information technology systems
would
 
                                      20
<PAGE>
 
have been incurred, regardless of the Year 2000 issue due to technology
obsolescence and/or Company growth. All costs arising from Year 2000 issues
have been, and will continue to be, expensed and funded from working capital.
 
  The Company does not believe that future expenditures to upgrade internal
systems and applications will have a material adverse effect on its business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while the
potential costs of redeployment of personnel and any delays in implementing
other projects is not known, the costs are anticipated to be immaterial and
the Company expects minimal adverse impact to the business.
 
 Risks of the Year 2000 Issues
 
  The Company believes its digital certificates and services are Year 2000
compliant; however, success of the Company's Year 2000 compliance efforts may
depend on the success of its customers dealing with Year 2000 issues. The
Company sells its products to companies in a variety of industries each with
different issues with Year 2000 compliance challenges. Customer difficulties
with Year 2000 issues could interfere with the use of Year 2000 compliant
digital certificates which might require the Company to devote additional
resources to resolve the underlying problems. If the problem exists within the
VeriSign digital certificate technology as it relates to its customers'
management systems and applications, the Company's business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
This risk is minimized by VeriSign's current offering of Year 2000 compliant
test certificates which can validate the Year 2000 operation of customer
applications and systems. However, there is no method to determine which
VeriSign customers will validate their applications and systems for Year 2000
compliance with VeriSign's technology.
 
  Furthermore, the purchasing patterns of these customers or potential
customers may be affected by Year 2000 issues as companies expend significant
resources to become Year 2000 compliant. The costs of becoming Year 2000
compliant for current or potential customers may result in reduced funds being
available to purchase and implement the Company's digital certificate and PKI
solutions.
 
 Contingency Plans
 
  With the assistance of an independent consulting firm, the Company was
provided with a Year 2000 project plan template. Of its Year 2000
recommendations, beyond those already identified through the Company's
internal review, no additional work was required. The Company has not yet
developed a contingency plan for handling Year 2000 problems that are not
detected and corrected prior to their occurrence. However, the Company has a
comprehensive business resumption plan in the event of a failure to the system
and/or network infrastructure at its primary location. Upon completion of
testing and implementation activities, the Company will be able to assess the
additional areas requiring contingency planning and expects to institute
appropriate contingency planning at that time. Any failure of the Company to
address any unforeseen Year 2000 issue could adversely affect the Company's
business, financial condition and results of operations.

</TABLE>
 
  Prior to its initial public offering, the Company financed its operations
primarily through private sales of equity securities raising approximately
$51.1 million. The Company's initial public offering, which closed in February
1998, yielded net proceeds of approximately $43.7 million. The Company's cash,
cash equivalents and
 
                                      21
<PAGE>
 
short-term investments, consisting principally of municipal bonds, auction
rate certificate securities, United States government and government agency
securities, and asset-backed securities, increased $29.6 million or 29% during
the first nine months of 1998. All of the Company's cash equivalents and
short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale under the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The securities are
carried at fair value. The unrealized gains and losses have been immaterial to
date.
 
  The Company also has an equipment loan agreement under which it may borrow
up to $3.0 million for purchases of equipment. This equipment loan agreement
expires on March 31, 1999. Any amounts borrowed under this equipment loan
agreement would bear interest at the rate of 7.5 percent per annum and would
be secured by the equipment purchased with the loan proceeds. In the event
that the Company borrows under this loan agreement, it would be obligated to
issue to the lender a warrant to purchase 17,500 shares of Common Stock. The
Company currently has no plans to borrow any amounts under this loan
agreement.
 
  The Company has had significant negative cash flows from operating
activities in each fiscal period to date, primarily as a result of the
Company's net losses. Net cash used in operating activities during the first
nine months of 1998 was $10.8 million as compared to $11.3 million during the
first nine months of 1997. The decrease was primarily the result of an
increase in both deferred revenue and accrued liabilities, offset in part by
increases in the Company's net loss and receivables.
 
  On July 6, 1998, the Company issued approximately 1,666,000 shares of its
common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding common stock of SecureIT,
a provider of Internet security products and services. The business
combination was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests combination, and the
Company incurred approximately $3.6 million for direct and other merger-
related costs pertaining to the merger transaction and certain stock-based
compensation charges.
 
  Net cash used in investing activities in the first nine months of 1998 was
$20.0 million as compared with $13.8 in the first nine months of 1997. Cash of
$3.5 million was used for capital expenditures in the first nine months of
1998 for computer equipment, purchased software, office equipment, furniture,
fixtures and leasehold improvements. The Company has planned capital
expenditures for the remainder of 1998 of approximately $1.0 million to $2.0
for computer systems for development, sales and marketing, product support and
administrative staff. Also during the first nine months of 1998, the Company
purchased net short-term investments totaling $16.4 million. The Company's
principal commitments as of September 30, 1998 consisted of obligations under
noncancelable operating leases.
 
  Net cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of 1998
was $44.0 million as compared to $1.8 million in the first nine months of
1997. The increase was primarily attributable to the $43.8 million in net
proceeds from the Company's initial public offering.
 
  The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital
expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. After that time, the
Company may need to raise additional funds through public or private
financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements. There can be no
assurance that such additional funding, if needed, will be available on terms
attractive to the Company, or at all. Strategic relationships, if necessary to
raise additional funds, may require the Company to relinquish rights to
certain of its technologies or products. The failure of the Company to raise
capital when needed could have a material adverse affect on the Company's
business, operating results and financial condition. If additional funds are
raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of
the Company of its then-current stockholders would be reduced. Furthermore,
such equity securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to
those of the Company's Common Stock.

ITEM 2. CHANGES IN SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
 
(d) Use of Proceeds.
 
  On January 30, 1998, the Company completed an initial public offering of its
Common Stock, $.001 par value (the "Offering"). The managing underwriters in
the Offering were Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Hambrecht & Quist LLC and
Wessels, Arnold & Henderson, L.L.C. (the "Underwriters"). The shares of Common
Stock sold in the Offering were registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, on a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-40789) (the
"Registration Statement"). The Registration Statement was declared effective
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on January 29, 1998.
 
  On January 30, 1998, the Company commenced the Offering. The Offering
terminated on January 30, 1998 after the Company had sold all of the 3,450,000
shares of Common Stock registered under the Registration Statement (including
450,000 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the Underwriters' over-
allotment option). The initial public offering price was $14 per share for an
aggregate initial public offering of $48,300,000. After deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and the Offering expenses, the net
proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $43,742,455.
 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 1998, the Company used
approximately $10.8 million of the net proceeds from the Company's initial
public offering to fund operating expenses, the transaction charges related to
the acquisition of SecureIT and increase working capital and $3.5 million to
purchase and install computers and peripheral equipment. The remaining $29.5
million has been invested in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade
securities.
