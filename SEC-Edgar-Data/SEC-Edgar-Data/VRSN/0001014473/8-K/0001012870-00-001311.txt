                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Stockholders of Thawte Holdings (Pty) Ltd., Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd.
and Thawte USA, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Thawte Holdings
(Pty) Ltd., Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. and Thawte USA, Inc. as of February 28,
1999 and 1998, and the related combined statements of operations, stockholders'
deficit and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended
February 28, 1999. These combined financial statements are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
combined financial statements based on our audits.

Scope

     We conducted our audits in accordance with U.S. generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes:

     .    examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
          disclosures in the financial statements,
     .    assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
          made by management, and
     .    evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.

     We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Audit Opinion

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the combined financial position of Thawte Holdings
(Pty) Ltd., Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. and Thawte USA, Inc. as of February 28,
1999 and 1998, and the combined results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the years in the two-year period ended February 28, 1999, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                          February 28, 1999 and 1998

Note 1.  Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Business

  Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. was incorporated in Cape Town, South Africa in
November 1997 when the entity changed from a close corporation with limited
creditor protection company with limited shareholder liability. Thawte USA, Inc.
was incorporated in May 1997. Thawte Holdings (Pty) Ltd. was incorporated in
Cape Town, South Africa in November 1997. Thawte Holdings (Pty) Ltd. has been
dormant for the period of November 7, 1997 to February 28, 1998. Thawte Holdings
(Pty) Ltd. is the holding company of Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd and does not
conduct any business of its own.

  The combined operation provides Internet-based trust services needed by
websites, enterprises and individuals to conduct trusted and secure commerce and
communications over the Internet. The combined operation provides both public
and private certificate authority services to organizations needing digital
certificates for website authentication electronic commerce and virtual private
network connections.

  Non co-terminus year-ends

  The financial year-end of Thawte USA, Inc. of December 31 is combined with the
February 28 first year statements of the South African operation. Significant
transactions within the trailing months would be reflected in the combined
financial statements.

  Foreign Currency Translation

  The functional currency for Thawte's international subsidiary is the U.S.
dollar. As a result, the subsidiaries' financial statements are translated into
South African Rand using a combination of current and historical exchange rates
and any transaction gains and losses are included in the cumulative translation
adjustment.

  Property and Equipment

  Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Other
than freehold land on which depreciation is not provided, depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally two to six years.

  Revenue Recognition

  Revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and
recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate, generally 12
months. Deferred revenue principally consists of payments for unexpired digital
certificates. Revenue represents net certification income, which excludes value-
added tax and represents the invoice value of services supplied, after taking
into account commission of R1,927,417.

  Advertising Expense

  Advertising expense is charged to operations as incurred. Advertising expense
was R358,000 in 1999 and R19,000 in 1998.

                          February 28, 1999 and 1998

  Income Taxes

  The combined operations use the asset and liability method to account for
income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for
deferred tax assets whose realization is not sufficiently likely.

  Concentration of Credit Risk

  Financial instruments that subject the combined operations to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents.
The combined operations maintain its cash and short-term investments with high
quality financial institutions. The combined operations require up front payment
for issuing of certificates and are therefore not subject to credit risk from
customers.

  Related Party Transactions

  Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. uses an affiliated company, Thawte USA, Inc., as
a foreign representative for certificate issuing in the United States. The
effect of inter-group transactions has been adjusted for when preparing the
combined financial statements.

Note 7.  Subsequent Event

     During the course of the year the Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. loaned
R100,000 to its sole director who utilized the proceeds as a loan to the
holdings company, Thawte Holdings (Pty) Ltd., subsequent to the year-end. These
funds were utilized by the holdings company to acquire the minority shares in
Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd. This is a contravention of Section 38 of the South
African Companies Act.

     In April 1999, the Thawte Holdings (Pty) Ltd. declared a dividend of
R250,000 to its holding company which is owned solely by Thawte Holding (Pty)
Ltd. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

                NOTES TO UNAUDITED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                           November 30, 1999 and 1998

Note 1.  Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

  Business

  The accompanying interim unaudited combined balance sheets and statements of
operations and cash flows reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in
the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial
position of Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd., Thawte Holdings (Pty) Ltd and Thawte
USA, Inc., at November 30, 1999, and the results of operations and cash flows
for the interim 9 month period ended November 30, 1999.

  The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include
all information and footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of Thawte's
combined unaudited results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

  The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily
indicative of our results of operations for any other future interim period or
for a full fiscal year.

  Non co-terminus year-ends

  The financial year end of Thawte Inc. is December 31 in comparison to February
28 of the South African operation. The difference in financial year-ends is
unlikely to affect the financial statement presentation.

  Foreign Currency Translation

  The functional currency for Thawte's international subsidiary is the U.S.
dollar. As a result, the subsidiaries' financial statements are translated into
South African Rand using a combination of current and historical exchange rates
and any transaction gains and losses are included in the cumulative translation
adjustment.

  Revenue Recognition

  Revenues from the sale or renewal of digital certificates are deferred and
recognized ratably over the life of the digital certificate, generally 12
months. Deferred revenue principally consists of payments for unexpired digital
certificates. Revenue represents net certification income, which excludes value-
added tax and represents the invoice value of services supplied, after taking
into account commission.

        NOTES TO UNAUDITED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)

                           November 30, 1999 and 1998

  Property and Equipment

  Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Other
than freehold land on which depreciation is not provided, depreciation is
calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, generally two to six years.

  Income Taxes

  The combined operations use the asset and liability method to account for
income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for
deferred tax assets whose realization is not sufficiently likely.

  Concentration of Credit Risk

  Financial instruments that subject the combined operations to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents.
The combined operations maintain its cash and short-term investments with high
quality financial institutions. The combined operations require up front payment
for issuing of certificates and are therefore not subject to credit risk from
customers.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Signio, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Signio, Inc. (formerly
PaymentNet, Inc.) as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related statements
of operations, shareholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then
ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Signio, Inc. (formerly
PaymentNet, Inc.) as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for the years in the two-year period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

     As discussed in note 1(a) to the financial statements, Signio, Inc. entered
into an agreement for the sale of its assets and liabilities to a third party on
December 17, 1999. The accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 1999 has
been prepared as of a date prior to the consummation of this sale. The
accompanying balance sheet does not include any adjustments relating to the
realization and classification of the recorded assets and liabilities that might
be necessary to reflect the intentions of the purchasers.

                        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                          December 31, 1999 and 1998


(1)  Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)  The Company

Signio, Inc., formerly PaymentNet, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in July
1995 in California. The Company delivers secure, reliable and fast e-commence
transaction processing services on an outsourced basis to organizations of
various sizes. The acquisition in May 1999 of Business Projects, Inc. (Business
Projects), brought a new chairman and CEO to the Company, as well as other
experienced engineering, marketing, and sales resources from Business Projects.
The acquisition in August 1999 of Structured Arts Computing Corporation
(Structured Arts) brought to the Company two individuals with engineering
experience related to internet security and digital certificates. In addition,
the Company also received intellectual property, which was subsequently licensed
to a third party.

On December 17, 1999, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its assets
and liabilities to a third party.

(b)  Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(c)  Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments
and accounts receivable. The Company invests in low-risk commercial paper with
short-term maturities. The Company provides services to companies in North
America. The Company does not require collateral or other security to support
accounts receivable. To reduce credit risk, management performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition. The Company maintains
allowances for doubtful accounts to cover potential credit losses.

(d)  Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

(e)  Short-Term Investments

Short-term investments as of December 31, 1999 consist of commercial paper and
bankers acceptances. The Company classifies its investment securities as trading
securities. Trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose
of selling them in the near term. Trading securities are recorded at fair value
and unrealized holding gains and losses are included in earnings. Unrealized
holding gains included in December 31, 1999 operating results totaled
approximately $38,000.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

                          December 31, 1999 and 1998

(f)  Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the lease term or the useful life of the related asset.

(g)  Revenue Recognition

Revenue consists primarily of service revenue which is recognized ratably over
the periods in which the services are provided. Advance customer deposits
received are deferred and allocated ratably to revenue over the periods the
services are provided.

During 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2, Software
Revenue Recognition, as amended by SOP No. 98-4 Deferral of the Effective Date
of a Provision of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition. SOP 97-2 provides
guidance for software revenue recognition. The adoption of SOP 97-2 did not have
a significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

In December 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position No. 98-9, Modifications
of SOP 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions.
SOP 98-9 requires recognition of revenue using the "residual method" in a
multiple-element software arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or
more of the delivered elements in the arrangement. Under the "residual method,"
the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and recognized in
accordance with SOP 97-2. SOP 98-9 also extends the deferral of the application
to SOP 97-2 to certain other multiple-element software arrangements to the
Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 2000. SOP 98-9 will not have
significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

(h)  Software Development Costs

The Company's transaction processing services are comprised of various software
features which contribute to the overall functionality of the service. Costs for
the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to
existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological
feasibility has been established, at which time any additional costs would be
capitalized in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 86, Computer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed. The
Company considers technological feasibility to be established upon completion of
a working model of the software and related hardware. Because the Company
believes its current process for developing software is essentially completed
concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility, no costs have
been capitalized to date.

The Company accounts for the costs of computer software developed or obtained
for internal use in accordance with SOP 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, which was effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998. This statement requires that
certain costs incurred during a software development project be capitalized.
These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services
consumed in the project, and internal costs such as payroll and benefits of
those employees directly associated with the development of software. During
1999, the Company did not capitalize any internal costs as there were no such
costs that met the definition for capitalization under SOP 98-1. External direct
costs of purchased internal use software have been capitalized and included in
fixed assets.

                  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

                          December 31, 1999 and 1998

(i)  Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

(j)  Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of
existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the
years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to an
amount whose realization is more likely than not. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date.

(k)  Intangibles

The intangible assets, consisting of goodwill and non-compete agreements, arose
principally from business acquisitions and are amortized on a straight-line
basis over the period of expected benefit, which is three years. The Company
assesses the recoverability of goodwill by evaluating the undiscounted projected
results of operations over the remaining amortization period.

(l)  Stock Option Plan

The Company applies the intrinsic value-based method of accounting prescribed by
Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees, and related interpretations, in accounting for its fixed plan stock
options. As such, compensation expense would be recorded on the date of grant
only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise
price. SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, established
accounting and disclosure requirements using a fair value-based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans. As allowed by SFAS No.
123, the Company has elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value-based
method of accounting described above, and has adopted the disclosure
requirements of SFAS No. 123.

Stock-based awards to nonemployees are accounted for pursuant to the fair value
method in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and EITF No. 96-18. The associated
expense is recognized by the Company over the period the services are performed
by the nonemployees.

The Company has recorded deferred compensation for the difference between the
exercise price and the deemed fair market value of the common stock for
financial reporting purposes of stock options granted to employees. The
compensation expense related to such grants is amortized over the vesting period
of the related stock options using the straight-line method.

                          December 31, 1999 and 1998

(m)  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

The Company accounts for long-lived assets in accordance with the provisions of
SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-
Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of. SFAS No. 121 requires that long-lived assets and
certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected
to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying
amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell.

(n)  Comprehensive (Loss) Income

In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.
130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which requires that an enterprise report,
by major components and as a single total, the change in its net assets from
nonowner sources. The Company adopted SFAS No. 130 in 1998, and for all periods
presented, comprehensive loss was equal to the Company's net loss.

(o)  Advertising Costs

All costs associated with advertising and promoting products are expensed in the
period incurred. Costs totaled $297,000 and $189,000 for the years ended
December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(2)  Business Combinations

(a)  Structured Arts Computing Corporation

On August 18, 1999, Signio completed the acquisition of certain engineering
equipment, intellectual property and noncompete agreements from Structured Arts
Computing Corporation (Structured Arts) for $400,000 in cash in a transaction
accounted for as a purchase business combination. Of the $400,000 purchase
price, $240,000 was allocated to goodwill with an estimated life of three years.
The intellectual property and noncompete agreements were assigned an estimated
life of three years. As of December 31, 1999, the balances of the intellectual
property and noncompete agreements were $66,667 and $71,111, respectively, net
of accumulated amortization of $8,333 and $8,889, respectively. As of December
31, 1999, the balance of the goodwill was $213,333, net of accumulated
amortization of $26,667.

(b)  Business Projects, Inc.

On May 18, 1999, Signio issued 775,000 shares of its Series B preferred stock
and warrants to purchase 310,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock for all of
the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Business Projects, Inc.
(Business Projects), a communications software company. The merger was accounted
for as a purchase, and accordingly, Signio's December 31, 1999 financial
statements include the results of Business Projects' operations since the date
of acquisition.

The fair value of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and warrants was
determined to be $775,000.

Of the $775,000 purchase price, $628,821 was assigned to goodwill with an
estimated life of three years. As of December 31, 1999, the balance of the
goodwill was $506,551, net of accumulated amortization of $122,270.

The purchase price was allocated to the assets and liabilities assumed as
follows:

(3)  Prepaid Compensation

In 1999, the Company issued two-year forgivable notes totaling $367,078 to
several employees for relocation expenses incurred upon being hired by the
Company. These notes earn interest at 4.98% and 5.43% and will be forgiven upon
the completion of two years of employment with the Company. In the event that an
employee leaves before the two years, the entire amount of the note will be owed
to the Company. The Company is amortizing the notes to compensation expense over
two years. As of December 31, 1999, $151,089 had been recorded as compensation
expense. The unamortized amount is presented as prepaid compensation in the
accompanying financial statements.

The Company no longer occupies a facility for which it has a remaining lease
obligation. The $130,023 of accrued rent primarily relates to the Company's
remaining obligation on a facility it is no longer using, net of the anticipated
sublease income.

The secured promissory note was due in 36 monthly installments of $7,892 and was
fully repaid in 1999.

(6)  Convertible Notes Payable

The Company has issued two separate traunches of convertible notes payable. The
first issuance was convertible at the option of the note holder into Series A
preferred stock and detachable warrants at a conversion rate of either $0.63 or
$1.00 per share. These notes accrued interest at 10% per annum and were due and
payable six months after issuance. The detachable warrants gave the holder the
right to purchase a variable number of shares of the Company's common stock at
35 cents per share. In 1998, $1,290,500 of notes payable were converted into
1,476,469 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 478,700 warrants to purchase
common stock. These warrants expire at various dates in 2000 and 2001. At the
conversion date, the Company recorded a charge of $2,911, which represents the
estimated value of the beneficial conversion feature measured at the date the
notes were issued.

The second issuance, which was sold in 1998, was convertible into Series B
preferred stock and detachable warrants at a conversion rate of $1.00 per share
upon the occurrence of a subsequent round of financing in excess of $4,000,000.
These notes accrued interest at 8% per annum and were due and payable six months
after issuance. The detachable warrants gave the holder the right to purchase a
variable number of Series B preferred shares at the value as determined by a
subsequent round of financing. In 1999, $1,088,160 of notes payable were
converted into 1,088,160 shares of Series B preferred stock and 214,299 warrants
to purchase Series B preferred stock at $1.00 per share. The warrants are
exercisable through 2003. At the conversion date, the Company recorded a charge
of $132,652, which represents the estimated value of the beneficial conversion
feature measured at the date the notes were issued.

(7)  Capital Stock and Stock Option Plan

(a)  Convertible Preferred Stock

Significant terms of the Series A and B preferred stock are as follows:

Each share is convertible into one share of common stock (subject to adjustments
for events of dilution) at the option of the holder. Each share will
automatically convert into common stock upon the completion of a public offering
with aggregate proceeds greater than $15,000,000 and at a price per share not
less than $5.00.

 . Each share has voting rights equal to the number of shares of common stock
  into which it may convert.

 . In the event of liquidation, dilution or winding up of the Company, the
  holders of Series A and B preferred stock shall receive first, and in
  preference, if any distribution to the common stock, an amount equal to the
  original issue price. Upon satisfaction of Series A and B liquidation
  preferences, the holders of Series A and B preferred stock and common stock
  shall receive on a pro rata basis the remaining assets of the Company until
  the holders of Series A and B preferred stock receive an aggregate of $3.50
  per share.

 . Series A and B preferred shareholders are entitled to noncumulative dividends
  of 8% of the original issuance price, when and if declared by the Board of
  Directors, prior to any dividends declared on common stock.

 . Preferred shareholders have certain registration rights.

(b)  Stock Option Plan

Under the 1998 Stock Option Plan, 3,100,000 shares of common stock are
authorized for issuance. During 1999, an additional 10,780,621 shares of common
stock were authorized for issuance. Under the Plan, incentive and nonstatutory
options may be granted to employees and nonemployees. Such options generally
vest over four years and expire in 10 years.

The Company allows its employees to exercise their options early. The common
stock received upon such exercise is subject to repurchase by the Company upon
the employees' termination at the exercise price. The Company's repurchase
rights lapse over the vesting period of the options.

In 1999, the Company issued nonrecourse and nonrefundable notes to certain
employees totaling $819,675 for the exercise of stock options. The notes bear
interest at approximately 5.5% and are secured by the underlying common stock.
Interest rates are fixed and accrued interest is nonrefundable. As of December
31, 1999, $16,021 of interest was accrued on notes receivable from shareholders.

Stock option activity is as follows:

As of December 31, 1999, 3,184,154 shares were available for future grant under

(c)  Additional Stock Option Information

As discussed in note 1, the Company accounts for its stock-based awards using
the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees and its related interpretations.

SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, requires the disclosure
of pro forma net loss had the Company adopted the fair value method. Under SFAS
No. 123, the fair value of stock-based awards to employees is calculated through
the use of option pricing models. These models require subjective assumptions,
including expected time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values.
The Company's calculations were made using the minimum value option pricing
model with the following weighted-average assumptions: expected life, four
years; risk-free interest rate of approximately 5%; and no dividend payments
during the expected term. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. If the
computed fair values of the Company's stock-based awards to employees had been
amortized to expense over the vesting period of the awards, the pro forma effect
on net loss would have been an increase of $103,000 and $1,300 for the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The Company granted 158,800 and 35,000 nonstatutory stock options to consultants
during the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Compensation
expense of $327,000 and $693 was recognized as a result of such grants in 1999
and 1998, respectively. The fair value of the unvested portion of such grants is
expensed over the vesting period of four years. The fair value attributable to
the unvested portion of such options is subject to adjustment based upon the
future value of the Company's common stock. The value of each option granted to
nonemployees was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions for the years
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998: contractual life, 10 years; risk-free interest
rate of approximately 5.7%; expected volatility of 90%; and no dividend payments
during the contractual term.

The weighted-average fair value of options granted to nonemployees was $9.16 and
$2.57 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

(d)  Preferred Stock Warrants

In 1998, in connection with the sale of Series A preferred stock, the Company
issued a warrant to purchase up to 40,000 shares of Series A preferred stock at
$1.00 per share. The warrant is exercisable through 2001. The estimated fair
value of this warrant of $15,525 has been accounted for as a reduction in the
proceeds of the Series A preferred financing and as a component of additional
paid-in capital.

In 1999, in connection with the sale of Series B preferred stock, the Company
issued warrants to purchase up to 5,965,991 shares of Series B preferred stock
at $1.00 per share. The warrants are exercisable through 2004. The estimated
fair value of these warrants of $3,423,520 has been accounted for as a reduction
in the proceeds of the Series B preferred financing and as a component of
additional paid-in capital.

(e)  Common Stock Warrants

During 1998, the Company issued to Series A investors, warrants to purchase
239,100 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $0.10 per
share. The warrants are exercisable through 2001. The estimated fair value of
these warrants of $9,278 has been accounted for as a reduction of the proceeds
of the Series A preferred financing and as a component of additional paid-in
capital.

As of December 31, 1999, the Company has reserved shares of common stock for

</TABLE>

The increase in the valuation allowance of $5,266,715 and $1,258,969 for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively, was primarily due to net
operating loss carryforwards.

As of December 31, 1999, the Company has federal and state net operating loss
carryfowards of approximately $13,642,000 and $13,473,000, respectively,
expiring through 2018 and 2003, respectively. The extent to which the loss
carryfowards can be used to offset future taxable income and tax liabilities may
be limited depending on the extent of ownership changes within any three-year
period.

(10)   Related Party Transaction

In December 1998, the Company purchased intellectual property for a note payable
in the amount of $135,000 from a company in which a member of the Board of
Directors has a financial interest. The asset was written off in fiscal 1998,
with a charge to expense, as it was subsequently deemed to be of no real value
to the Company. The note was repaid in fiscal 1999. As of December 31, 1998, the
above-mentioned member of the Board of Directors received advances from the
Company totaling $74,958. These advances were repaid to the Company in 1999.

(11)   401(k) Plan

In August 1998, the Company established a deferred profit sharing 401(k) plan
and trust (the Plan) for all employees who meet certain eligibility
requirements. The Company's contributions to the Plan are discretionary, and
there were no contributions made for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.

          UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
are presented for illustrative purposes only and are not necessarily indicative
of the combined financial position or results of operations for future periods
or the financial position that actually would have been realized had VeriSign,
Thawte and Signio been a combined company during the specified periods. The
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements, including the
related notes, are qualified in their entirety by reference to, and should be
read in conjunction with, historical consolidated financial statements and
related notes thereto of VeriSign, Thawte and Signio, included elsewhere in this
filing.

     The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
give effect to the merger between VeriSign and Thawte, and VeriSign and Signio
using the purchase method of accounting. The pro forma combined condensed
financial statements are based on the respective historical audited and
unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes of VeriSign,
Thawte and Signio. The pro forma adjustments are preliminary and based on
management's estimates of the value of the tangible and intangible assets
acquired. In addition, management is in the process of assessing and formulating
its integration plans, which may include employee separations, employee
relocations, and other restructuring actions and has not yet determined the
costs, if any, of these plans.

     The actual adjustments may differ materially from those presented in these
pro forma financial statements. A change in the pro forma adjustments would
result in reallocation of the purchase price affecting the value assigned to the
long-term tangible and intangible assets or, in some circumstances, in a charge
to the statement of operations. The effect of these changes on the statement of
operations will depend on the nature and amounts of the assets and liabilities
adjusted. See Note 1 (a) to the pro forma combined condensed financial
statements.

     The unaudited pro forma combined condensed balance sheet assumes that the
merger took place on December 31, 1999, and combines VeriSign's and Signio's
audited December 31, 1999 balance sheet with Thawte's unaudited November 30,
1999 combined balance sheet. The pro forma combined statements of operations
assume the merger took place as of January 1, 1999 and combines VeriSign's and
Signio's audited statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 1999,
with Thawte's unaudited statement of operations for the twelve months ended
November 30, 1999.

Note 1.  Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Balance Sheet

         The pro forma combined condensed balance sheet gives effect to the
merger as if it had occurred on December 31, 1999.

     Thawte

     On February 1, 2000, VeriSign acquired all the outstanding capital stock of
Thawte in exchange for 4,360,424 shares of VeriSign common stock and $60,000 of
cash. The following adjustment has been reflected in the unaudited pro forma
combined condensed balance sheet:

     (a)  To record common stock issued to the shareholder of Thawte, and record
          applicable purchase accounting entries. Transaction costs were not
          significant to the total purchase price and were therefore not
          included below.

          Under purchase accounting, the total purchase price will be allocated
          to Thawte's tangible assets and liabilities based on their relative
          fair values. Allocations are subject to valuations as of the date of
          the consummation of the merger. The amounts and components of the
          estimated purchase price along with the preliminary allocation of the
          estimated purchase price to net assets purchased are presented below.

</TABLE>

          The actual allocation of the purchase price will depend upon the
          composition of Thawte's net assets on the closing date and VeriSign's
          evaluation of the fair value of the net assets as of the date
          indicated. Consequently, the actual allocation of the purchase price
          could differ from that presented above.

     Signio

     On February 29, 2000, VeriSign acquired all the outstanding capital stock
of Signio in exchange for 5,591,819 shares of VeriSign common stock. In
addition, VeriSign issued options to purchase a total of approximately 234,227
shares of VeriSign common stock in exchange for all issued and outstanding
Signio options. The following adjustment has been reflected in the unaudited pro
forma combined condensed balance sheet:

     (c)  To record common stock and options issued to the shareholders of
          Signio, and record applicable purchase accounting entries. Transaction
          costs were not significant to the total purchase price and were

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of VeriSign, Inc.:

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of VeriSign,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, comprehensive
income (loss) and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1999. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of VeriSign,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

Note 1.  Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

     Business

     VeriSign, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in April 1995 when RSA Data
Security, Inc. ("RSA") contributed equipment, other assets and technology for
common stock. This transfer of nonmonetary assets was recorded at the founder's
historical cost basis. VeriSign provides Internet-based trust services needed by
websites, enterprises and individuals to conduct trusted and secure electronic
commerce and communications over the Internet, intranets and extranets ("IP
Networks"). VeriSign provides both public and private certificate authority
services to organizations needing digital certificates for website
authentication, intranet and extranet access control, electronic commerce
services and virtual private network connections.

     Consolidation

     The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
VeriSign and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and
transactions. As of December 31, 1999, VeriSign owned approximately 50.5% of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of its subsidiary, VeriSign Japan K.K.
Changes in VeriSign's proportionate share of the net assets of VeriSign Japan
resulting from sales of capital stock by the subsidiary are accounted for as
equity transactions.

     Foreign Currency Translation

     The functional currency for VeriSign's international subsidiaries is the
U.S. dollar; however, the subsidiaries books of record are maintained in local
currency. As a result, the subsidiaries' financial statements are remeasured
into U.S. dollars using a combination of current and historical exchange rates
and any transaction gains and losses are included in operating results.

     Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short and Long-Term Investments

     VeriSign considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three
months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash
equivalents include money market funds, commercial paper, market auction
securities, and various deposit accounts.

     VeriSign's investments are classified as "available-for-sale" and are
carried at fair value based on quoted market prices. These investments consist
of commercial paper, medium term notes, U.S. government and agency securities
and corporate bonds and notes. These investments with original maturities
greater than three months and less than twelve months are considered short-term
investments and those with original maturities greater than twelve months are
considered long-term investments. Realized gains and losses upon sale or
maturity of these investments are determined using the specific identification
method.

     VeriSign invests in equity instruments of privately-held, technology
companies for business and strategic purposes. These investments are included in
long-term investments and are accounted for under the cost method. For these
non-quoted investments, VeriSign's policy is to regularly review the assumptions
underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the
carrying values. VeriSign identifies and records impairment losses on long-lived
assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be
impaired. To date, no such impairment has been recorded. During 1999, one of
these investments in Keynote Systems, Inc., became a marketable equity security
when Keynote Systems, Inc. completed their initial public offering. This
investment is subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to
the volatility of the stock market, and is recorded in long-term investments.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)

                       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

     Property and Equipment

     Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, generally three to five years.

     Computer Software Costs

     In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use." SOP 98-1 requires
that entities capitalize certain costs related to internal-use software once
certain criteria have been met. The Company implemented SOP 98-1 for the year
ended December 31, 1999.

     Revenue Recognition

     Revenues from our services consist of fees for the issuance of digital
certificates, fees for digital certificate service provisioning, fees for
technology and business process licensing to affiliates and fees for consulting,
implementation, training, support and maintenance services. Each of these
sources of revenue has different revenue recognition methods. We defer revenues
from the sale or renewal of digital certificates and recognize these revenues
ratably over the life of the digital certificate, generally 12 months. We defer
revenues from the sale of our OnSite managed services and recognize these
revenues ratably over the term of the license, generally 12 months. We recognize
revenues from the sale of digital certificate technology and business process
licensing to affiliates upon delivery of the technology and signing of an
agreement, provided the fee is fixed and determinable, collectibility is
probable and the arrangement does not require significant production,
modification or customization of the software. We recognize revenues from
consulting and training services using the percentage-of-completion method for
fixed-fee development arrangements or as the services are provided for time-and-
materials arrangements. We recognize revenues ratably over the term of the
agreement for support and maintenance services.

     VeriSign recognizes revenue in accordance with the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants' ("AICPA") Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition." SOP No. 97-2 generally requires revenue earned
on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each
element based on its relative fair value. The fair value of the element must be
based on objective evidence that is specific to the vendor. If a vendor does not
have objective evidence of the fair value of all elements in a multiple-element
arrangement, all revenue from the arrangement must be deferred until such
evidence exists or until all elements have been delivered.

     Research and Development Costs

     Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred
subsequent to establishing technological feasibility, in the form of a working
model, are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives. To date,
software development costs incurred after technological feasibility has been
established have not been material.

     Advertising Expense

     Advertising expense is charged to operations as incurred. Advertising
expense was $3,037,000 in 1999, $1,858,000 in 1998 and $197,000 in 1997.

                       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

     Income Taxes

     VeriSign uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded for
deferred tax assets whose realization is not sufficiently likely.

     Stock-Based Compensation

     VeriSign accounts for its equity-based compensation plan using the
intrinsic value method.

     Net Income (Loss) Per Share

     Basic net income (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average
number of outstanding shares of common stock. Diluted net income (loss) per
share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options computed using the
treasury stock method and convertible securities using the if-converted method.

     The following table presents the calculation for the number of shares used
in the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations:

                                                            Year Ended December 31,

</TABLE>

     For 1999, VeriSign excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per
share 481,320 shares related to stock options with an exercise price higher than
$49.70, the weighted average fair market value for the year. For 1998 and 1997,
VeriSign excluded all convertible preferred stock and outstanding stock options
from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because these securities
would have been anti-dilutive for these periods. The excluded shares totaled
16,516,368 shares for 1998 and 50,495,180 shares for 1997.

     Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

     Other comprehensive income (loss) includes gains and losses that are not
included in net income (loss) but instead are recorded directly in stockholders'
equity. Other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains (losses) on
investments.

                       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

     Concentration of Credit Risk

     Financial instruments that potentially subject VeriSign to significant
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, cash equivalents,
short and long-term investments and accounts receivable. VeriSign maintains its
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments with high quality financial
institutions and, as part of its cash management process, performs periodic
evaluations of the relative credit standing of these financial institutions.
VeriSign also performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and,
generally, requires no collateral. VeriSign maintains an allowance for potential
credit losses. Amounts added to the allowance for doubtful accounts through
charges to bad debt expense totaled $859,000 in 1999, $590,000 in 1998 and
$387,000 in 1997. Uncollectible amounts written off totaled $268,000 in 1999,
$359,000 in 1998 and $136,000 in 1997.

     Related Party Transactions

     During 1998, VeriSign signed a joint venture agreement with certain
companies located in France to form Certplus, a provider of Internet trust
services. VeriSign has a minority interest of 15% in the joint venture, and
therefore has accounted for this as a long-term investment. Certplus is an
affiliate in the VeriSign affiliate program. Certplus accounted for
approximately 1% of revenues in 1999 and less than 1% of revenues in 1998 and
1997. Certplus accounted for 1% of the accounts receivable balance as of
December 31, 1999 and 2% of the accounts receivable balance as of December 31,
1998.

     In February 1999, VeriSign entered into a memorandum of understanding with
Keynote Systems. VeriSign is a 7% shareholder of Keynote as of December 31, 1999
and Stratton Sclavos, president and chief executive officer is a member of
Keynote's board of directors. Under the agreement, VeriSign received from
Keynote a non-exclusive license to sell two versions of Keynote's services as an
integrated part of VeriSign's product offerings. Per the agreement, VeriSign
will pay a fee to Keynote for each of these introductory services sold to a
customer. In the event that Keynote converts the introductory customer into a
paying customer within a certain timeframe, then Keynote will pay VeriSign a
one-time bounty fee for each customer. Through December 31, 1999, VeriSign has
received $20,000 in revenue and has paid Keynote approximately $250,000 under
this agreement.

     VeriSign entered into a development agreement in September 1997 with RSA
Security, formerly Security Dynamics Technologies, Inc. ("RSA Security"), the
parent company of RSA, an approximately 5% stockholder of VeriSign at December
31, 1999, to develop a customized certificate authority product in order to
enable RSA Security to offer a product with encryption and digital certificate
authority functionality. In December 1998, VeriSign and RSA Security amended the
development agreement to grant RSA Security an exclusive license to incorporate
the developed technology into original equipment manufacturers' ("OEM") products
in order to create products incorporating the technology and to sublicense the
technology to licensees of the OEMs.

     The development agreement provides that RSA Security pay VeriSign an
aggregate of $2.7 million as an initial license fee, of which $.9 million was
paid in October 1997, $1.4 million was paid during 1998 and $.4 million was paid
during 1999. At the time of the execution of the amendment in December 1998, RSA
Security paid VeriSign $500,000. Once RSA Security has received net revenues of
$2.8 million from OEMs, it will pay VeriSign a royalty equal to the greater of
18% of net revenues from the sale to OEMs or 18% of 60% of the current list
price for the product. RSA Security will not be obligated to pay any royalties
to VeriSign with respect to sales to value-added resellers.

                       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

     In order for RSA Security to maintain its exclusivity rights, it must make
certain minimum aggregate annual payments to VeriSign, which are payable on a
quarterly basis. In addition, VeriSign will be obligated to pay RSA Security an
amount equal to 8% of net revenue recognized by VeriSign during a VeriSign
OnSite customers' first year using VeriSign OnSite if the customer had
previously purchased products from RSA Security that incorporate the developed
technology.

     Beginning in March 1998, RSA Security is required to pay VeriSign a monthly
product support fee for a three-year period and thereafter for successive annual
terms. For a yearly fee, RSA Security can purchase product maintenance services.
RSA Security paid both support and maintenance fees aggregating $210,000 in 1999
and $105,000 in 1998.

     Revenue from the development agreement accounted for less than 1% of
revenues in 1999, 6% of revenues in 1998 and 4% of revenues in 1997.

     In July 1999, VeriSign entered into a non-exclusive reseller agreement with
RSA Security to grant RSA Security the right to resell certain VeriSign products
and services for a discounted fee. Revenue from the reseller agreement accounted
for 1% of revenues in 1999.

     At December 31, 1999, VeriSign had no customers that accounted for more
than 10% of accounts receivable. At December 31, 1998, VeriSign had one
customer, a South African systems integrator, that accounted for 18% of accounts
receivable. VeriSign had one customer that accounted for 10% of revenues in 1997
and no other customers that accounted for more than 10% of revenues in 1999 or
1998. VeriSign had no other customers that accounted for more than 10% of
accounts receivable for any of the dates or years presented.

     Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

     VeriSign reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of
the carrying amount to future net cash flows the assets are expected to
generate. If assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be
recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long-
lived asset exceeds its fair market value. To date, no adjustments to the
carrying value of long-lived assets have been required.

     Use of Estimates

     The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

     Recent Accounting Pronouncements

     In June 1998 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 established methods of
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities related
to those instruments as well as other hedging activities. Because it currently
holds no derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities,
VeriSign expects that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have no material impact
on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. VeriSign will be
required to implement SFAS No. 133, as amended, for the year ending December 31,
2001.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)

                       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

     In December 1998, the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-9, "Modification of SOP 97-2,
Software Revenue Recognition, with Respect to Certain Transactions." SOP No. 98-
9 requires recognition of revenue using the "residual method" in a multiple-
element software arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more of
the delivered elements in the arrangement. Under the "residual method," the
total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and recognized in
accordance with SOP No. 97-2. VeriSign will be required to implement SOP No. 98-
9 for the year ending December 31, 2000. SOP No. 98-9 also extended the deferral
of the application of SOP No. 97-2 to certain other multiple-element software
arrangements through the year ended December 31, 1999. We expect that the
adoption of SOP No. 98-9 will not have a material impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 2.  Business Combination

     In July 1998, VeriSign completed a merger with SecureIT, Inc. ("SecureIT").
SecureIT is a provider of Internet and enterprise security solutions comprising
a full range of products and services to assist clients with assessing,
designing and implementing security solutions. The merger was effected by
exchanging approximately 6,664,000 shares of VeriSign common stock for all of
the outstanding common stock of SecureIT. Each share of SecureIT was exchanged
for 0.164806 of one share of VeriSign common stock. In addition, outstanding
SecureIT employee stock options were converted at the same exchange ratio into
options to purchase approximately 760,000 shares of VeriSign common stock.

     The merger constituted a tax-free reorganization and has been accounted for
as a pooling-of-interests. Accordingly, all prior period financial statements
have been restated to include the combined results of operations, financial
position and cash flows of SecureIT as if it had always been a part of VeriSign.
There were no intercompany transactions between VeriSign and SecureIT prior to
the combination that required elimination and there were no material adjustments
required to conform SecureIT's accounting policies to those of VeriSign. Direct
costs and other related merger costs of approximately $3.6 million were incurred
in connection with the acquisition (see Note 9).

     The results of operations previously reported by the separate companies and
the combined amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements are
summarized below.

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)

                       December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

Note 5.   Stockholders' Equity

  Stock Splits

  In March 1999, the Board of Directors (the "Board") declared a two-for-one
stock split for stockholders of record on May 14, 1999. In November 1999, the
Board declared an additional two-for-one stock split for stockholders of record
on November 22, 1999. All share and per share information has been restated to
reflect the effect of the stock splits.

  Preferred Stock

  VeriSign is authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As
of December 31, 1999, no shares of preferred stock had been issued.

  Common Stock

  On January 30, 1998, VeriSign completed its initial public offering ("IPO") by
issuing 13,800,000 shares of its common stock at an initial public offering
price of $3.50 per share. VeriSign received net proceeds from the offering,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, of
approximately $43.7 million. Concurrently with the IPO, each outstanding share
of VeriSign's convertible preferred stock was automatically converted into one
share of common stock.

  In January 1999, VeriSign completed a follow-on public offering by issuing
6,390,000 shares at an offering price of $20.13 per share. VeriSign received net
proceeds from the offering of approximately $121.4 million.

  No dividends have been declared or paid on common stock since VeriSign's
inception. SecureIT paid Subchapter S distributions of $793,000 to its
stockholders for minimum tax obligations during the year ended December 31,
1998.

  Notes Receivable From Stockholders

  In November 1996, VeriSign loaned several officers an aggregate of $543,000,
due December 31, 2005, bearing interest at a rate per annum of 6.95%, payable
quarterly. In August 1997, VeriSign loaned an officer an aggregate of $116,000,
due December 31, 2006, bearing interest at a rate per annum of 6.87%, payable
quarterly. The loans are full recourse and are collateralized by pledges of the
shares of VeriSign common stock that were purchased. As of December 31, 1999,
all loans had been repaid in full.

Note 6.   Stock Compensation Plans

  Stock Option Plans

  As of December 31, 1999, a total of 22,719,893 shares of common stock were
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and for the future
grant of stock options or awards under VeriSign's equity incentive plans.

  The 1995 Stock Option Plan and the 1997 Stock Option Plan (the "1995 and 1997
Plans") were terminated concurrent with VeriSign's IPO. Options to purchase
common stock granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans remain outstanding and
subject to the vesting and exercise terms of the original grant. All shares that
remained available for future issuance under the 1995 and 1997 Plans at the time
of their termination were transferred to the 1998 Equity Incentive Plan. No
further options can be granted under the 1995 and 1997 Plans. Options granted
under the 1995 and 1997 Plans are subject to terms substantially similar to
those described below with respect to options granted under the 1998 Equity
Incentive Plan.

  The 1998 Equity Incentive Plan (the "1998 Plan") authorizes the award of
options, restricted stock awards and stock bonuses. As of December 31, 1998, no
restricted stock awards or stock bonus awards have been made under the 1998
Plan.

  Options may be granted at an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair
market value of VeriSign's common stock on the date of grant for incentive stock
options and 85% of the fair market value for nonqualified stock options. All
options are granted at the discretion of the Board and have a term not greater
than 7 years from the date of grant. Options issued generally vest 25% on the
first anniversary date and ratably over the following 12 quarters. At December
31, 1999, 4,677,031 shares remain available for future awards under the 1998
Plan.

  Members of the Board who are not employees of VeriSign, or of any parent,
subsidiary or affiliate of VeriSign, are eligible to participate in the 1998
Directors Plan (the "Directors Plan). The option grants under the Directors Plan
are automatic and nondiscretionary, and the exercise price of the options is
100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Each
eligible director who becomes a director on or after January 28, 1998 will
initially be granted an option to purchase 60,000 shares on the date he or she
first becomes a director (the "Initial Grant"). On each anniversary of a
director's Initial Grant or most recent grant if he or she was ineligible to
receive an Initial Grant, each eligible director will automatically be granted
an additional option to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock if the director
has served continuously as a director since the date of the Initial Grant or
most recent grant. The term of the options under the Directors Plan is ten years

the SecureIT Plan generally have a term of seven years and vest over a four-year
period, 25% on each anniversary of the grant date. No further options can be
granted under the SecureIT Plan.

  1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

  VeriSign has reserved 3,000,000 shares for issuance under the 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan ("Purchase Plan"). Eligible employees may purchase common
stock through payroll deductions by electing to have between 2% and 15% of their
compensation withheld. Each participant is granted an option to purchase common
stock on the first day of each 24 month offering period and this option is
automatically exercised on the last day of each six month purchase period during
the offering period. The purchase price for the common stock under the Purchase
Plan is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock on the
first day of the applicable offering period and the last day of the applicable
purchase period. The first offering period began on January 30, 1998. Offering
periods thereafter will begin on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Shares of
common stock issued under the Purchase Plan totaled 547,896 in 1999 and 232,900
in 1998. As of December 31, 1999, 2,219,204 shares remain available for future
issuance. The weighted-average fair value of the options granted under the
Purchase Plan was $15.28 in 1999 and $7.18 in 1998.

  Pro Forma Information

  VeriSign applies the intrinsic value method in accounting for its equity-based
compensation plan. Had compensation cost for its equity-based compensation plans
been determined consistent with the fair value approach set forth in SFAS No.
123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," VeriSign's net income (loss)
would have been as follows:

  The fair value of stock options and Purchase Plan options granted subsequent
to VeriSign's IPO on January 30, 1998 was estimated on the date of grant using
the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of stock options granted prior to the
IPO and for stock options granted by SecureIT prior to its acquisition was
estimated on the date of grant using the minimum value method. The following
table sets forth the weighted-average assumptions used to calculate the fair
value of the stock options and Purchase Plan options for each period presented.

  Management has established a valuation allowance equal to 100% of the net
deferred tax assets because the realization of the deferred tax assets is
uncertain. The total valuation allowance decreased $18,439,000 in 1999 and
increased $13,250,000 in 1998.

  Gross deferred tax assets as of December 31, 1999 include approximately
$36,919,000 relating to the exercise of stock options, which is subject to a
valuation allowance of approximately $7,736,000. Upon reversal of this valuation
allowance, the tax benefit realized will be credited to stockholders'
equity.

  As of December 31, 1999, VeriSign has available net operating loss
carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately $127,376,000 and
for California income tax purposes of approximately $64,510,000. The federal net
operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in 2010 through 2019.
The California net operating loss carryforwards will expire, if not utilized, in
2004.

  As of December 31, 1999, VeriSign has available for carryover research and
experimentation tax credits for federal income tax purposes of approximately
$1,444,000 and for California income tax purposes of approximately $1,004,000.
The federal research and experimentation tax credits will expire, if not
utilized, in 2010 through 2019. California research and experimental tax credits
carry forward indefinitely until utilized. VeriSign also has federal foreign tax
credits of approximately $758,000, which expire, if not utilized, in 2001
through 2002. To date, foreign income taxes have not been significant.

  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 imposed substantial restrictions on the utilization
of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an "ownership change" of
a corporation. Accordingly, VeriSign's ability to utilize net operating loss and
credit carryforwards may be limited as a result of such an "ownership change" as
defined in the Internal Revenue Code.

Note 9.  Special Charges

  Merger-related expenses

  In connection with the acquisition of SecureIT in July 1998 (see Note 2),
VeriSign recorded a special charge of $3.6 million for direct and other merger-
related costs pertaining to the merger transaction and certain stock-based
compensation charges. Merger transaction costs totaled $2.4 million and
consisted primarily of fees for investment bankers, attorneys and accountants,
filing fees and other related charges. The stock-based compensation charges of
$1.2 million related to certain performance stock options held by SecureIT
employees, the vesting of which either automatically accelerated upon change of
control or were accelerated by VeriSign's Board of Directors subsequent to the
merger.

  VeriFone

  In September 1996, VeriFone, Inc. which subsequently became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard, filed a lawsuit against VeriSign alleging, among
other things, trademark infringement. In November 1997, VeriSign, Hewlett-
Packard and VeriFone reached an agreement, under which, among other things, the
Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, which were transferred to
Hewlett-Packard, and VeriSign and VeriFone settled all claims. The settlement
amount was recorded in the third quarter of 1997 as a $2.0 million charge to
operations.

  Microsoft

     In November 1997, VeriSign entered into a preferred provider agreement with
Microsoft Corporation ("Microsoft") whereby the companies will develop, promote
and distribute a variety of client-based and server-based digital certificate
solutions and VeriSign will be designated as the premier provider of digital
certificates for Microsoft customers. In connection with the agreement, VeriSign
issued 400,000 shares of common stock to Microsoft resulting in an $800,000
charge to operations.

Note 10.  Segment Information

  VeriSign has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131,
"Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information". This
statement establishes standards for publicly held entities to follow in
reporting information about operating segments in annual financial statements
and requires that those entities report selected information about operating
segments in interim financial statements. This statement also establishes
standards for related disclosures about product and services, geographic areas
and major customers. Operating segments are defined by SFAS No. 131 as
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. VeriSign has
identified one reportable operating segment based on the criteria of SFAS No.
131.

  VeriSign operates in the United States, Europe and Japan and derives
substantially all of its revenues from sales of Internet-based trust services.
VeriSign's Chief Executive and Executive Officers evaluate financial performance
based on measures of business segment revenues.
