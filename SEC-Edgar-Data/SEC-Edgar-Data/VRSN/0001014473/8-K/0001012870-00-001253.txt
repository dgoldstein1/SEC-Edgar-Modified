Item 5:  Other Events.

         On March 6, 2000, VeriSign, Inc. ("VeriSign"), Network Solutions, Inc.
("NSI") and Nickel Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
VeriSign ("Merger Sub") entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
"Merger Agreement"). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into NSI, with NSI to survive the
Merger and to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of VeriSign (the "Merger"). Each
outstanding share of NSI common stock will be exchanged for 2.15 shares of
VeriSign common stock, and options to purchase NSI capital stock will be
exchanged for options to purchase shares of VeriSign common stock according to
the exchange ratio. Upon completion of the proposed 2-for-1 stock split of NSI's
common stock on March 10, 2000, the exchange ratio will be 1.075 shares of
VeriSign for each outstanding share of NSI common stock.

         The transaction will be structured to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization and will be accounted for as a purchase. In addition, VeriSign
will take all action necessary to appoint an additional three members to its
board of directors, with such new members to be mutally agreed upon between the
boards of directors of VeriSign and NSI.

         In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, VeriSign and
SAIC Venture Capital Corporation ("SAIC") entered into a Voting Agreement (the
"Voting Agreement"), pursuant to which SAIC agreed to vote the 8,150,000 shares
of NSI common stock held by it, constituting approximately 23% of NSI's
outstanding common stock, in favor of the Merger and against any proposal made
in opposition to or in competition with the Merger. SAIC granted VeriSign's
board of directors an irrevocable proxy to vote SAIC's shares in favor of the
Merger and against any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with the
Merger. SAIC also agreed not to transfer its shares of NSI common stock prior to
the consummation of the Merger.

         Pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement entered into between
VeriSign and SAIC (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), SAIC will also be
granted certain registration rights with respect to the shares of VeriSign
common stock that it will receive in the Merger. SAIC will be entitled to, on up
to three occasions, require VeriSign to register the shares of VeriSign common
stock it receives in the Merger and will also be entitled to "piggyback"
registration rights.

         Each of the Merger Agreement, Voting Agreement and Registration Rights
Agreement are filed as exhibits to this report. The foregoing description is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such exhibits.

         A press release announcing the transaction is attached as an exhibit to
this report. The Merger is subject to several conditions, including approval by
both companies' stockholders, the expiration of applicable waiting periods under
antitrust laws and obtaining necessary consents.

                          Agreement and Plan of Merger


     This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of March 6, 2000, among VeriSign, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Nickel Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned first-tier subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and Network Solutions,
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company").

                                    Recitals

     A.  The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and Company
have approved this Agreement, and declared advisable the merger of Merger Sub
with and into Company (the "Merger") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law").

     B.  For United States federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended
to qualify as a "reorganization" pursuant to the provisions of Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  For accounting
purposes, the Merger is intended to be accounted for as a "purchase" under
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

     C.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, a
stockholder of Company is entering into a Voting Agreement with Parent in the
form of Exhibit A (the "Voting Agreement").

     D.  Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and a
stockholder of Company are entering into a Registration Rights Agreement in the
form of Exhibit B (the "Registration Rights Agreement").

     In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:


                                    Article I
                                   The Merger

     1.1  The Merger.  Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
          ----------
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, at the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

     1.2  Effective Time; Closing.  Subject to the provisions of this
          -----------------------
Agreement, Company and Merger Sub will file a certificate of merger, in such
appropriate form as determined by the parties, with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant
<PAGE>

provisions of Delaware Law (the "Certificate of Merger") (the time of such
filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and Parent and
specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Fenwick & West LLP, Two Palo Alto
Square, Palo Alto, California, at a time and date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such
other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the
"Closing Date").

     1.3  Effect of the Merger.  At the Effective Time, the effect of the
          --------------------

rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, and shall
be subject to all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub.

Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended as provided by law and such Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time Article I
of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended to read: "The name of the corporation is `Network Solutions, Inc.'"

          (b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended.

     1.5  Directors and Officers.  The initial directors of the Surviving
          ----------------------
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed

     1.6  Effect on Capital Stock.  Subject to the terms and conditions of

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b), will be canceled
and extinguished and automatically converted (subject to Section 1.6(e)) into
the right to receive 2.15 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") upon surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock in the manner
provided in Section 1.7.  No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be

of the Merger, but in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to
Section 1.7(e). For the avoidance of doubt, following the two-for-one stock
dividend payable on Company Common Stock on March 10, 2000, the Exchange Ratio
will be 1.075.

          (b) Cancellation of Company-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock.  Each share
              ----------------------------------------------------
of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any
direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.

          (c) Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  At the Effective
              -------------------------------------------
Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under
Company's 1996 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan") shall be
assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.9 of this Agreement.  Rights
outstanding under Company's 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Company
ESPP") shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.9 of this Agreement.

          (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of common stock, par
              ---------------------------
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock"), issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.  Following the Effective Time,
each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common stock shall
evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

          (e) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio.  The Exchange Ratio shall be
              -----------------------------
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

     1.7  Exchange of Certificates.
          ------------------------

          (a) Exchange Agent.  Parent shall select an institution reasonably
              --------------
acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger.

          (b) Exchange Fund.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
              -------------
make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common
Stock, together with cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund") issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock.

          (c) Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
              -------------------
shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates ("Certificates") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose
shares were converted into shares of Parent Common Stock

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (that
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common
Stock. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common
Stock were converted at the Effective Time, payment in lieu of fractional shares
that such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the
Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes, to evidence only the ownership of the number of full
shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock
shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu
of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.7(e) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d). No interest
will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock or on any unpaid dividends or distributions payable to holders of
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of Company, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock may
be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

          (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  No dividends or
              ------------------------------------------------
other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of
such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates.  Subject to applicable law,
following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver
to the holders of certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly, the amount of any
cash payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
occurring after surrender, payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock.

          (e) Fractional Shares.  (i) As promptly as practicable following the
              -----------------
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number
of full shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant
to Section 1.7(b), over (B) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common
Stock to be distributed to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.7(c) (such excess, the "Excess Shares").

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Following the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of
Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at then prevailing prices on
the Nasdaq Stock Market in the manner set forth in paragraph (ii) of this
Section 1.7(e).

          (ii) The sale of the excess shares by the Exchange Agent shall be
executed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and shall be executed in round lots to the
extent practicable.  The Exchange Agent shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Shares as promptly following the
Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agent's reasonable judgment, is practicable
consistent with obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of
prevailing market conditions.  Until the net proceeds of such sales have been
distributed to the holders of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold
such proceeds in trust for the holders of Company Common Stock.  The Exchange
Agent will determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of
Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional share interest to which such holder of Company Common Stock is
entitled (after taking into account all shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued to such holder) and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Company Common Stock are
entitled.  As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash,
if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock with respect to fractional
share interests, the Exchange Agent shall promptly pay such amounts to such
holders of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of Section 1.7(c).

          (iii)  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (i) and (ii) of
this Section 1.7(e), Parent may decide, at its option, exercised prior to the
Effective Time, in lieu of the issuance and sale of Excess Shares and the making
of the payments contemplated in such paragraphs, that Parent shall pay to the
Exchange Agent an amount sufficient for the Exchange Agent to pay each holder of
Company Common Stock the amount such holder would have received pursuant to
Section 1.7(e)(ii) assuming that the sales of Parent Common Stock were made at a
price equal to the average of the closing prices of the Parent Common Stock on
the Nasdaq Stock Market for the ten consecutive trading days immediately
following the Effective Time and, in such case, all references herein to the
cash proceeds of the sale of the Excess Shares and similar references shall be
deemed to mean and refer to the payments calculated as set forth in this
paragraph (iii).  In such event, Excess Shares shall not be issued or otherwise
transferred to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Sections 1.7(b) or (e).

          (f) Required Withholding.  Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
              --------------------
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable Legal Requirement
(as defined in Section 2.2(b)).  To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

          (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event that any
              --------------------------------------
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6, cash for fractional shares,
if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); provided, however, that Parent
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash and other
distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates
to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed.

          (h) No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
              ------------
Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor
any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

          (i) Termination of Exchange Fund.  Any portion of the Exchange Fund
              ----------------------------
which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and
any holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with the
provisions of this Section 1.7 shall thereafter look only to Parent for the
shares of Parent Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(e) and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which
they are entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d), in each case, without any interest
thereon.

     1.8  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  All shares of
          ---------------------------------------------------
Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any
cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.7(d) and (e)) shall be deemed
to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.  If after the
Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any
reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

     1.9  Restricted Stock.  If any shares of Company Common Stock that are
          ----------------
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject
to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition providing that
such shares ("Company Restricted Stock") may be forfeited or repurchased by the
Company upon any termination of the stockholders' employment, directorship or
other relationship with the Company (and/or any affiliate of the Company) under
the terms of any restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with the
Company that does not by its terms provide that such repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition lapses upon consummation of the Merger, then the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the conversion of such shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger will continue to be unvested and subject to
the same repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

following the Effective Time, and the certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends noting
such repurchase options, risks of forfeiture or other conditions. Company shall
take all actions that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement. A listing of the holders of Company Restricted Stock, together with
the number of shares and the vesting schedule of Company Restricted Stock held
by each, is set forth in Part 1.9 of the Company Disclosure Letter.

     1.10  Tax Consequences.  It is intended by the parties hereto that the
           ----------------
Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of
the Code.  The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization"
within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Income Tax Regulations.

     1.11  Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.  If, at any time after
           ------------------------------------------
the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company
and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and necessary action.  Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

supplement or

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to Company's
stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or, if as of
the time for which Company Stockholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set
forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of
Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders' Meeting.
Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders' Meeting is called, noticed,
convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies solicited by the Company in
connection with the Company Stockholders' Meeting are solicited, in compliance
with the Delaware Law, its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, the rules of
the Nasdaq Stock Market and all other applicable legal requirements. Company's
obligation to call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders'
Meeting in accordance with this Section 5.2(a) shall not be limited to or
otherwise affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission
to Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer, or by any withdrawal,
amendment or modification of the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Company with respect to this Agreement or the Merger.

          (b) Subject to Section 5.2(c):  (i) the Board of Directors of Company
shall recommend that Company's stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and
approve this Agreement and approve the Merger at the Company Stockholders'
Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a statement to the
effect that the Board of Directors of Company has  recommended that Company's
stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the

or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to

stockholders vote in favor of and adopt and approve this Agreement and the
Merger.

          (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of Directors of
the Company from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying its
recommendation in favor of the Merger if (i) a Superior Offer (as defined below)
is made to the Company and is not withdrawn, (ii) the Company shall have
provided written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior Offer") advising Parent
that the Company has received a Superior Offer, specifying all of the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Offer and identifying the person or entity
making such Superior Offer, (iii) Parent shall not have, within three business
days of Parent's receipt of the Notice of Superior Offer, made an offer that the
Company's Board of Directors by a majority vote determines in its good faith
judgment (based on the written advice of a financial advisor of national
standing) to be at least as favorable to Company's stockholders as such Superior
Offer (it being agreed that the Board of Directors of Company shall convene a
meeting to consider any such offer by Parent promptly following the receipt
thereof), (iv) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that, in light of such Superior Offer,
the withholding, withdrawal, amendment or modification of such recommendation is
required in order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to Company's stockholders under applicable law and (v)
Company shall not have violated any of the restrictions set forth in Section 5.4
or this Section 5.2.  Company shall provide Parent with at least two business
days prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to the members of the
Company's Board of Directors but in no event less than twenty-

                                      -45-
<PAGE>

four hours) of any meeting of the Company's Board of Directors at which
Company's Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any Acquisition
Proposal (as defined in Section 5.4) to determine whether such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Offer. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2(c) shall
limit the Company's obligation to hold and convene the Company Stockholders'
Meeting (regardless of whether the recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Company shall have been withdrawn, amended or modified). For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Offer" shall mean an unsolicited, bona fide written offer
made by a third party to consummate any of the following transactions: (i) a
merger or consolidation involving Company pursuant to which the stockholders of
Company immediately preceding such transaction hold less than 50% of the equity
interest in the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or (ii) the
acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender offer or an
exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender offer followed with
reasonable promptness by a merger involving the Company), directly or
indirectly, of ownership of 100% of the then outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company, on terms that the Board of Directors of the Company determines,
in its reasonable judgment (based on the written advice of a financial advisor
of national standing) to be more favorable to the Company stockholders than the
terms of the Merger; provided, however, that any such offer shall not be deemed
to be a "Superior Offer" if any financing required to consummate the transaction
contemplated by such offer is not committed and is not likely in the reasonable
judgment of the Company's Board of Directors (based on the advice of its
financial advisor) to be obtained by such third party on a timely basis.

          (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
its Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

     5.3  Meeting of Parent Stockholders.

necessary in accordance with the Delaware Law and its Certificate of

applicable law) within 45 days after the declaration of effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, for the purpose of voting upon the Parent Stockholder
Approvals.  Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of the Parent Stockholder
Approvals and will take all other action necessary to secure the vote or consent
of its stockholders required by the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market or Delaware
Law to obtain such approvals.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, Parent may adjourn or postpone the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any necessary
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is provided to
Parent's stockholders in advance of a vote on the Parent Stockholder Approvals

scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) there are
insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting.  Parent shall ensure that the Parent Stockholders'
Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all proxies
solicited by Parent in connection with the Parent Stockholders' Meeting are
solicited, in

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

compliance with the Delaware Law, its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws,
the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market and all other applicable legal
requirements.

          (b) (i) The Board of Directors of Parent shall recommend that Parent's
stockholders approve the Parent Stockholder Approvals at the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting; (ii) the Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall include a
statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of Parent has recommended
that Parent's stockholders approve the Parent Stockholder Approvals at the
Company Stockholders' Meeting; and (iii) neither the Board of Directors of
Parent nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or
resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Company, the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of Parent that Parent's stockholders
approve the Parent Stockholder Approvals.

          (c) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Parent or its
Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, encourage or induce the making, submission or
announcement of any Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any

or any contract, agreement or commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to
any Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger at the Company
Stockholders' Meeting, this Section 5.4(a) shall not prohibit Company from
furnishing nonpublic information regarding Company and its subsidiaries to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person or group who has
submitted (and not withdrawn) to Company an unsolicited, written, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company reasonably concludes
(based on the written advice of a financial advisor of national standing) may
constitute a Superior Offer if (1) neither Company nor any representative of
Company and its subsidiaries shall have violated any of the restrictions set
forth in this Section 5.4, (2) the Board of Directors of Company concludes in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action
is required in order for the Board of Directors of Company to comply with its
fiduciary obligations to Company's stockholders under applicable law, (3) prior
to furnishing any such nonpublic information to, or entering into any such
discussions with, such person or group, Company gives Parent written notice of
the identity of such person or group and all of the material terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and of Company's intention to furnish
nonpublic information to, or enter into discussions with, such person or group,
and Company receives from such person or group an executed

                                      -47-

confidentiality agreement containing terms at least as restrictive with regard

Company gives Parent at least two business days advance notice of its intent to
furnish such nonpublic information or enter into such discussions, and (5)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such person
or group, Company furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent
such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by the Company to
Parent). Company and its subsidiaries will immediately cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Without limiting the
foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
the preceding two sentences by any officer, director or employee of Company or
any of its subsidiaries or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or
representative of Company or any of its subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.4 by Company.

     For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any offer
or proposal by a third party relating to:  (A) any acquisition or purchase from

          ----------------------

          (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option, whether or
not then exercisable, will be assumed by Parent.  Each Company Option so assumed
by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the
same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Option Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase
rights or vesting provisions), except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be
exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock and (ii) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option will be equal
to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company

                                      -50-
<PAGE>

Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.
Continuous employment with Company or its subsidiaries shall be credited to the
optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of all assumed Company Options
after the Effective Time.

           (b) It is intended that Company Options assumed by Parent shall
qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent Company Options qualified as incentive
stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the provisions of this
Section 5.9 shall be applied consistent with such intent.

           (c) Company shall take all actions necessary pursuant to the terms of
the Company ESPP in order to shorten the Participation Period(s) under such plan
which includes the Effective Time (the "Current Offerings") such that a new
purchase date for each such Participation Period shall occur prior to the
Effective Time and shares shall be purchased by Company ESPP participants prior
to the Effective Time.  The Current Offerings shall expire immediately following
such new purchase date, and the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately prior
to the Effective Time.  Subsequent to such new purchase date, Company shall take
no action, pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP, to commence any new
offering period.

     5.10  Form S-8.  Parent agrees to file a registration statement on

Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and its
directors and officers as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") and
any indemnification provisions under Company's Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to
exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of Company, unless such modification is required
by law.

           (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if available, directors'
and officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently
covered by Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy on
terms comparable to those applicable to the current directors and officers of
Company; provided, however, that in no event will Parent or the

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual
premium currently paid by Company for such coverage (or such coverage as is
available for such 200% of such annual premium).

           (c) This Section 5.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger,
is intended to benefit Company, the Surviving Corporation and each Indemnified
Party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties.

for consideration at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting an amendment to Parent's
Bylaws to increase the authorized number of members of the Parent Board of
Directors to a number to be determined by the Parent Board of Directors from
time to time, provided, that for three years following the Effective Time, any
increase in the actual number of directors to a total of more than nine will
require the affirmative vote of 80% of the directors then in office. The Board
of Directors of Parent will take all actions reasonably necessary such that,
effective upon the Effective Time, three persons mutually agreed upon by
Parent's Board of Directors and Company's Board of Directors (the "New
Directors") shall be appointed to Parent's Board of Directors, one of each of
whom shall be appointed to Class I, Class II and Class III of Parent's Board of
Directors, such designation to be made by mutual agreement of Parent's Board of
Directors and Company's Board of Directors. Parent will use its best efforts to
fulfill the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(e).

           ----------------------
their respective reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent letters
of Company's and Parent's independent accountants, respectively, dated no more
than two business days before the date on which the Registration Statement
becomes effective (and satisfactory in form and substance to Parent), that is
customary in scope and substance for letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Registration Statement.


     5.15  Takeover Statutes.  If any Takeover Statute is or may become
           -----------------
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, each of Parent and Company and their respective Boards of Directors
shall grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary to
ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute and any regulations promulgated thereunder
on such transactions.

     (a) As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Company
and Parent shall confer and work together in good faith to agree upon mutually
acceptable employee benefit and compensation arrangements (and terminate Company
Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time if appropriate).  In
addition, Company agrees that it and its

                                      -52-

for all service with the Company, its subsidiaries and with SAIC and its
Affiliates under each Company employee benefit plan, program or arrangement of
Parent or its Affiliates in which such Employees are eligible to participate for
all purposes, except for purposes of benefit accrual under a defined benefit
pension plan.   If Employees become eligible to participate in a medical, dental
or health plan of Parent or its Affiliates, Parent will cause such plan to (i)
waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting period limitations for
conditions covered under the applicable medical, dental or health plans
maintained or contributed to by Company (but only to the extent corresponding
exclusions and limitations were satisfied by such Employees under the applicable
medical, dental or health plans maintained or contributed to by Company); and
(ii) credit any deductible or out of pocket expenses incurred by the Employees
and their beneficiaries under such plans during the portion of the calendar year
prior to such participation.

     (c) Company and Parent agree to work diligently and cooperate to separate
the benefit plans of SAIC and Company.

     5.17  Tax Matters.  Each of Parent, Merger Sub and Company agrees that it
           -----------
will not take any action, or fail to take any action, which action or failure to
act would be reasonably likely to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a
"reorganization" pursuant to the provisions of Section 368 of the Code.

     7.2  Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination.  Any proper
          --------------------------------------------
termination of this Agreement under Section 7.1 above will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the
other parties hereto.  In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect,
except (i) as set forth in this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of
which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.
No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

     7.3  Fees and Expenses.
          -----------------

          (a) General.  Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and
              -------
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated; provided, however, that Parent and Company
shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys' and accountants

          (b) Company Payments.  In the event that this Agreement is terminated
              ----------------
by Parent or Company, as applicable, pursuant to Sections 7.1(d), 7.1(f) or
7.1(h), the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than two days after
the date of such termination, pay Parent a fee equal to $425 million in
immediately available funds (the "Termination Fee"); provided, that in the case
of a termination under Sections 7.1(d) or 7.1(h) prior to which no Triggering
Event has occurred, (i) such payment shall be made only if (A) following the
date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, a person
has publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal and (B) within nine months
following the termination of this Agreement, either a Company Acquisition (as
defined below) is consummated, or the Company enters into an agreement providing
for a Company Acquisition and such Company Acquisition is later consummated with
the person (or another person controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with, such person) with whom such agreement was entered into (regardless
of when such consummation occurs if the Company has entered into such an
agreement within such nine-month period), and (ii) such payment shall be made
promptly, but in no event later than two days after the consummation of such
Company Acquisition (regardless of when such consummation occurs if the Company
has entered into such an agreement within such nine-month period).  Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the amounts due
pursuant to this Section 7.3(b), and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company for the amounts set
forth in this Section 7.3(b), Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section
7.3(b) at the prime rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect on the date such
payment was required to be made.  Payment of the fees described in this Section
7.3(b) shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this
Agreement.

          For the purposes of this Agreement, "Company Acquisition" shall mean
any of the following transactions (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement); (i) a merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the
Company pursuant to which the stockholders of the Company immediately preceding
such transaction hold less than 50% of the aggregate equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction, (ii) a sale or other
disposition by the Company of assets representing in excess of 50% of the
aggregate fair market value of the Company's business immediately prior to such
sale, or of either of the "registry" or "registrar" businesses of Company, or
(iii) the acquisition by any person or group (including by way of a tender offer
or an exchange offer or issuance by Company), directly or indirectly, of
beneficial ownership or a right to acquire beneficial ownership of shares
representing in excess of 50% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
a Company Acquisition shall not include a spin-off or other distribution of
either the "registry" or "registrar" businesses of Company to Company's
stockholders.

     7.4  Amendment.  Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended
          ---------
by the parties hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent and Company.

accordance with its terms, except (i) as the same may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting creditors' rights, and (ii) for the limitations imposed
by general principles of equity. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not,
conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation which would result in the
creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the Shares owned by such Stockholder
under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of any agreement,
judgment, injunction, order, decree, or other instrument binding on such
Stockholder or any Shares owned by such Stockholder. No consent, approval, order

regulations thereunder, and (ii) where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, orders or authorizations would not prevent or materially delay the
performance by Stockholder of its obligations under this Agreement. If this

person signing this Agreement has full power and authority to enter into and
perform such Agreement.

power of substitution and resubstitution, to the full extent of the

                         Registration Rights Agreement

     This Registration Rights Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered
into as of March 6, 2000 (the "Effective Date") by and between VeriSign, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and SAIC Venture Capital Corporation, a Nevada
corporation (the "Holder"), who immediately prior to the Effective Time of the
Merger (as defined below) is a stockholder of Network Solutions, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("NSI").

                                    Recitals

     A.  Parent, NSI and Nickel Acquisition Corporation ("Merger Sub") have
entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Plan") dated as of the date
hereof, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into NSI in a reverse
triangular merger with NSI to be the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Merger").  Capitalized terms used herein and not defined herein shall have the
meanings given in the Merger Agreement.

     B.  In connection with the Merger, Parent desires to grant to Holder
certain registration rights with respect to the shares of the Parent Common
Stock that are issued to Holder in the Merger (the "Merger Shares"), subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

     In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:

     1.  Registration Rights.

          1.1  Definitions.  For purposes of this Section 1:
               -----------

          (a) Registration.  The terms "register," "registered," and
              ------------
"registration" refer to a registration effected by preparing and filing a
registration statement in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), and the declaration or ordering of effectiveness of such
registration statement.

          (b) Registrable Securities.  The term "Registrable Securities" means:
              ----------------------
(1) all of the Merger Shares, and (2) any shares of Common Stock of Parent
issued as a dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for
or in replacement of, the Merger Shares; excluding in all cases, however, any
Registrable Securities sold in a public offering pursuant to a registration
statement filed with the SEC or sold to the public pursuant to Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule 144") or Rule 145 under the
Securities Act ("Rule 145") or otherwise.

          (c) Prospectus.  The term "Prospectus" shall mean the prospectus
              ----------
included in any Registration Statement filed pursuant to the provisions hereof
(including, without limitation, a prospectus that discloses information
previously omitted from a prospectus filed as part of an effective registration
statement in reliance upon Rule 430A promulgated under the
<PAGE>

Securities Act), as amended or supplemented by any prospectus supplement
(including, without limitation, any prospectus supplement with respect to the
terms of the offering of any portion of the Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement), and all other amendments and supplements to the
Prospectus, including post-effective amendments, and all material incorporated
by reference or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus.

               (d) SEC.  The term "SEC" or "Commission" means the U.S.
                   ---
Securities and Exchange Commission.

          1.2  Demand Registration.
               -------------------

          (a) Request by Holders.  Any time after six months following the date
              ------------------
of this Agreement, if the Parent shall receive a written request from the Holder
that Parent file a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the
registration of not less than 2,000,000 shares of Registrable Securities
pursuant to this Section 1.2, then Parent shall, as soon as practicable, effect
the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable Securities that
Holder requests to be registered and included in such registration.

          (b) Underwriting.  If the Holder intends to distribute the Registrable
              ------------
Securities covered by its request by means of an underwriting, then it shall so
advise the Parent as a part of its request made pursuant to this Section 1.2(a).
The Holder shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the
managing underwriter or underwriters selected for such underwriting by the
Holder, which managing underwriter or underwriters shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section
1.2, if the underwriter(s) advise(s) the Parent in writing that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of securities to be underwritten then
the Parent shall so advise the Holder, and the number of Registrable Securities
that may be included in the underwriting shall be reduced as required by the
underwriter(s) and allocated first to the Holder and second to the Parent or
other stockholders of the Parent; provided, however, that the number of shares
of Registrable Securities to be included in such underwriting and registration
shall not be reduced unless all other securities of the Parent are first
entirely excluded from the underwriting and registration.  Any Registrable
Securities excluded and withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from
the registration.

          (c) Maximum Number of Demand Registrations.  The Parent is obligated
              --------------------------------------
to effect only one such registration during any six month period and three (3)
such registrations in the aggregate pursuant to this Section 1.2.

          (d) Deferral.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Parent shall
              --------
furnish to Holder, a certificate signed by the President or Chief Executive
Officer of the Parent stating that in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Parent, it would be seriously detrimental to the Parent and its
shareholders for such registration statement to be filed and it is therefore
essential to defer the filing of such registration statement, then the Parent
shall have the right to defer such filing for a period of not more than 60 days
after receipt of the request of the Holder; provided, however, that the Parent
may not utilize this right more than once in any twelve month period.
<PAGE>

          (e) Expenses.  All expenses incurred in connection with a registration
              --------
pursuant to this Section 1.2, including without limitation all registration and
qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Parent, (but excluding underwriters' discounts and commissions),
shall be borne by the Parent.  The Holder shall bear a proportionate share
(based on the total number of shares sold in such registration for the account
of the Holder) of all discounts, commissions or other amounts payable to
underwriters or brokers in connection with such offering and the fees and
disbursements of any separate counsel retained by the Holder.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Parent shall not be required to pay for any expenses of any
registration proceeding begun pursuant to this Section 1.2 if the registration
request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the Holder, unless the
Holder agrees to forfeit its right to demand registration pursuant to this
Section 1.2; provided, further, however, that if at the time of such withdrawal,
the Holder has learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business,
or prospects of the Parent not known to the Holder at the time of its request
for such registration and has withdrawn its request for registration with
reasonable promptness after learning of such material adverse change, then the
Holder shall not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain its
rights pursuant to this Section 1.2.

          1.3  Piggyback Registrations.  The Parent shall notify the Holder in
               -----------------------
writing at least thirty days prior to filing any registration statement under
the Securities Act for purposes of effecting a public offering of securities of
the Parent (excluding registration statements relating to any employee benefit
plan or a corporate reorganization) and will afford Holder an opportunity to
include in such registration statement all or any part of the Registrable
Securities then held by Holder.  Holder shall, within twenty days after receipt
of the above-described notice from the Parent, so notify the Parent in writing,
and in such notice shall inform the Parent of the number of Registrable
Securities Holder wishes to include in such registration statement.  If Holder
decides not to include or does not sell all of its Registrable Securities in any
registration statement thereafter filed by the Parent, Holder shall nevertheless
continue to have the right to include any Registrable Securities in any
subsequent registration statement or registration statements as may be filed by
the Parent with respect to offerings of its securities, all upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

          (a) Underwriting.  If a registration statement under which the Parent
              ------------
gives notice under this Section 1.3 is for an underwritten offering, then the
Parent shall so advise the Holder.  In such event, the right of Holder's
Registrable Securities to be included in a registration pursuant to this Section
1.3 shall be conditioned upon Holder's participation in such underwriting and
the inclusion of Holder's Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the
extent provided herein.  Holder, when proposing to distribute its Registrable
Securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting agreement
in customary form with the managing underwriter or underwriter(s) selected for
such underwriting.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if
the managing underwriter determine(s) in good faith that marketing factors
require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, then the
managing underwriter(s) may exclude shares (including Registrable Securities)
from the registration and the underwriting, and the number of shares that may be
included in the registration and the underwriting shall be allocated, first, to
                                                                      -----
shareholders exercising any demand registration rights, second to the Parent,
                                                        ------
and third, to the Holder.  If Holder disapproves of the terms of any such
    -----
underwriting, Holder may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the
Parent and the underwriter, delivered at least ten (10) days prior to the
effective date of the
<PAGE>

registration statement. Any Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from
such underwriting shall be excluded and withdrawn from the registration.

          (b) Expenses.  All expenses incurred in connection with a registration
              --------
pursuant to this Section 1.3 (excluding underwriters' and brokers' discounts and
commissions), including, without limitation all federal and "blue sky"
registration and qualification fees, printers' and accounting fees, fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Parent shall be borne by the Parent.

          1.4  Obligations of the Parent. Whenever required to effect the
               -------------------------
registration of any Registrable Securities under this Agreement, the Parent
shall, as expeditiously as reasonably possible:

          (a) Prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement with
respect to such Registrable Securities and use reasonable, diligent efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective, and, upon the request of
Holder, keep such registration statement effective for up to ninety days.

          (b) Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to
such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such
registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
registration statement.

          (c) Furnish to Holder such number of copies of a prospectus, including
a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act, and such other documents as they may reasonably request in order to
facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by them that are
included in such registration.

          (d) Use reasonable, diligent efforts to register and qualify the
securities covered by such registration statement under such other securities or
Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by Holder,
provided that the Parent shall not be required in connection therewith or as a
condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to
service of process in any such states or jurisdictions.

          (e) In the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and
perform its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary
form, with the managing underwriter(s) of such offering.  Holder participating
in such underwriting shall also enter into and perform its obligations under
such an agreement.

          (f) Notify Holder at any time when a prospectus relating to the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of
which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing.

          1.5  Furnish Information.  It shall be a condition precedent to the
               -------------------
obligations of the Parent to take any action pursuant to Sections 1.2 or 1.3
that Holder shall furnish to the
<PAGE>

Parent such information regarding itself, the Registrable Securities held by it,
and the intended method of disposition of such securities as shall be required
to timely effect the registration of its Registrable Securities.

          1.6  Delay of Registration.  Holder shall not have any right to obtain
               ---------------------
or seek an injunction restraining or otherwise delaying any such registration as
the result of any controversy that might arise with respect to the
interpretation or implementation of this Section 1.

          1.7  Indemnification.  In the event any Registrable Securities are
               ---------------
included in a registration statement under Sections 1.2 or 1.3:

          (a) By the Parent.  To the extent permitted by law, the Parent will
              -------------
indemnify and hold harmless Holder, any officer or director of Holder, any
underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for Holder and each person, if
any, who controls Holder or such underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the
"Exchange Act") against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities (joint or
several) to which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any
of the following statements, omissions or violations (collectively, "Violations"
and, individually, a "Violation"):

               (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in such registration statement, including any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or any amendments
or supplements thereto;

               (2) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; or

               (3) any violation or alleged violation by the Parent of the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, any U.S. federal or state securities law or any
rule or regulation promulgated under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, or any
U.S. federal or state securities law in connection with the offering covered by
such registration statement.

and the Parent will reimburse Holder, any officer or director of Holder,
underwriter or such controlling person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them, as incurred, in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided however,
that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.7(a) shall not apply
to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), nor shall the Parent be liable in
any such case for any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action to the
extent that it arises out of or is based upon a Violation which occurs in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly for
use in connection with such registration by Holder, such underwriter or
controlling person.

          (b) By Holder.  To the extent permitted by law, Holder will indemnify
              ---------
and hold harmless the Parent, each of its directors, each of its officers who
have signed the registration statement, each person, if any, who controls the
Parent within the meaning of the Securities Act and any underwriter against any
losses, claims or liabilities to which such person
<PAGE>

may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal
or state law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon any Violation, in each case
to the extent (and only to the extent) that such Violation occurs in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished by Holder expressly
for use in connection with such registration; and Holder will reimburse any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Parent or any such director,
officer, controlling person or underwriter in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action; provided, however,
that the indemnity agreement contained in this subsection 1.7(b) shall not apply
to amounts paid in settlement of any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and provided further, that the total
amounts payable in indemnity by Holder under this subsection 1.7(b) in respect
of any Violation, together with the amount of any damages that such Holder, its
directors, officers or any person who controls such Holder has otherwise been
required to pay by reason of such Violation shall not exceed the net proceeds
received by such Holder in the registered offering out of which such Violation
arises.

          (c) Notice.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
              ------
Section 1.7 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any
governmental action), such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof
is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 1.7, deliver to
the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement thereof and the
indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and, to the extent
the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly noticed, to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually
satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnified party shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid
by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the
counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual
or potential conflict of interests between such indemnified party and any other
party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.  The failure to deliver
written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the
commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such
action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the
indemnified party under this Section 1.7, but the omission so to deliver written
notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it
may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 1.7.

          (d) Defect Eliminated in Final Prospectus.  The foregoing indemnity
              -------------------------------------
agreements of the Parent and Holder are subject to the condition that, insofar
as they relate to any Violation made in a preliminary prospectus but eliminated
or remedied in the amended prospectus on file with the SEC at the time the
registration statement in question becomes effective or the amended prospectus
filed with the SEC pursuant to SEC Rule 424(b) (the "Final Prospectus"), such
indemnity agreement shall not inure to the benefit of any person if a copy of
the Final Prospectus was furnished to the indemnified party and was not
furnished to the person asserting the loss, liability, claim or damage at or
prior to the time such action is required by the Securities Act, but only to the
extent such failure to deliver the Final Prospectus is the fault of the
indemnified party or any person acting on such indemnified person's behalf.

          (e) Contribution.  In order to provide for just and equitable
              ------------
contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which
either (1) Holder or
<PAGE>

any controlling person of Holder, makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to
this Section 1.7 but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final
judgment or decree by a court of competent jurisdiction and the expiration of
time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such
indemnification may not be enforced in such case notwithstanding the fact that
this Section 1.7 provides for indemnification in such case, or (2) contribution
under the Securities Act may be required on the part of Holder or any such
officer, director or controlling person in circumstances for which
indemnification is provided under this Section 1.7; then, and in each such case,
the Parent and Holder will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages
or liabilities to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative faults of the
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other
hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or judgments, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the
one hand, and of the indemnified party, on the other hand, shall be determined
by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact relates to information supplied by the Parent, on
the one hand, or by the Holder, on the other, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The Parent and the Holder agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 1.7(e) were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 1.7, (A) Holder
will not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the public offering
price of all such Registrable Securities offered and sold by Holder pursuant to
such registration statement less the amount of any damages which such Holder has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission; and (B) no person or entity guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person or entity who
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

          (f) Survival.  The obligations of the Parent and Holder under this
              --------
Section 1.7 shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable
Securities in a registration statement, and otherwise.

          1.8  Rule 144 Reporting.  With a view to making available the benefits
               ------------------
of certain rules and regulations of the Commission which may at any time permit
the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, after
such time as a public market exists for the Common Stock of the Parent, the
Parent agrees to:

          (a) Make and keep public information available, as those terms are
understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times after
the effective date of the first registration under the Securities Act filed by
the Parent for an offering of its securities to the general public;

          (b) Use reasonable, diligent efforts to file with the Commission in a
timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Parent under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after it has become subject to
such reporting requirements); and
<PAGE>

          (c) So long as Holder owns any Registrable Securities, to furnish to
the Holder forthwith upon request a written statement by the Parent as to its
compliance with the reporting requirements of said Rule 144, the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of
the Parent, and such other reports and documents of the Parent as a Holder may
reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the
Commission allowing Holder to sell any such securities without registration.

          1.9  Termination of the Parent's Obligations.  The Parent shall have
               ---------------------------------------
no obligations pursuant to Sections 1.2 and 1.3 with respect to (a) any request
or requests for registration made by Holder after March 6, 2005, or (b) any
Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by Holder in a registration pursuant
to Section 1.2 or 1.3 if the Parent has delivered a written opinion addressed to
Holder to the effect that all such Registrable Securities proposed to be sold by
Holder may be sold in a three-month period without registration under the
Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 145 without restrictions with
respect to notice, manner of sale or current public information as provided in
such Rules.

          1.10  Termination of NSI Registration Rights.  Upon the effectiveness
                --------------------------------------
of the Merger, all of the Holders rights and NSI's obligations under the
Registration Rights Agreement between them shall be terminated and shall be of
no further force or effect.

VeriSign Acquires Network Solutions to Form World's Largest Provider of Internet
Trust Services

Combined Trust Infrastructure to Accelerate E-Commerce for Millions of
Businesses and Consumers Across the Internet

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. and HERNDON, Va., March 7 /PRNewswire/ -- VeriSign, Inc.
(Nasdaq: VRSN - news), the leading provider of Internet trust services, and
         ----   ----
Network Solutions, Inc. (Nasdaq: NSOL - news), the world's leading provider of
                                 ----   ----
Internet domain name registration and global registry services, today announced
the signing of a definitive agreement for VeriSign to acquire Network Solutions
in an all-stock purchase transaction. This transaction combines two
infrastructure leaders whose trust services support businesses and consumers
from the moment they first establish an Internet presence through the entire
lifecycle of e-commerce activities.

Under the agreement, VeriSign will issue 2.15 shares of VeriSign common stock
for each share of Network Solutions stock as constituted prior to the 2-for-1
split of Network Solutions stock to be completed on March 10, 2000. The
transaction, valued at approximately $21 billion based on yesterday's closing
price of VeriSign common stock, has been approved by both companies' Boards of
Directors and is subject to approval by VeriSign and Network Solutions
stockholders. The acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2000,
subject to customary conditions, including obtaining necessary regulatory
approvals. The resulting company expects to add to its existing employee base to
exploit new market opportunities. At closing, Network Solutions will become a
subsidiary of VeriSign with Jim Rutt continuing to serve as Network Solutions'
CEO, reporting to Stratton Sclavos, president and CEO of VeriSign.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Such statements are based on the current expectations and beliefs of managements
of VeriSign and Network Solutions and are subject to a number of factors and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
described in the forward-looking statements. In particular, the following
factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from
those described in the forward-looking statements: failure of the transaction to
close due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; failure of the
VeriSign or Network Solutions stockholders to approve the merger; the risk that
the VeriSign and Network Solutions businesses will not be integrated
successfully and unanticipated costs of such integration; failure of the
combined company to retain and hire key executives, technical personnel and
other employees; failure of the combined company to manage its growth and the
difficulty of successfully managing a larger, more geographically dispersed
organization; failure of the combined company to successfully manage its
changing relationships with customers, suppliers and strategic customers;
failure of the combined company's customers to accept the new service offerings
and, in particular, the risk that businesses and consumers may not adopt the
Internet for electronic commerce as rapidly as anticipated; the risk that
security breakdowns on the Internet might adversely affect the growth of
electronic commerce; and competition in the various markets serviced by the
