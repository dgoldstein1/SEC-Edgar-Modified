Item 2: Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

     On February 29, 2000, VeriSign completed the acquisition of Signio, Inc. a
provider of a provider of payment services connecting online merchants,
business-to-business exchanges, payment processors and financial institutions
over the Internet. In the transaction, Signio merged with a wholly-owned
subsidiary of VeriSign, with Signio becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of
VeriSign. VeriSign issued approximately 5.6 million shares of its common stock
for all of the outstanding capital stock of Signio. In addition, VeriSign
assumed all then outstanding Signio employee stock options. The acquisition will
be accounted for as a purchase and is not intended to qualify as a tax-free
reorganization.

     In connection with this transaction, VeriSign has filed a shelf
registration statement for the public resale of the shares issued in the
exchange.

Item 7: Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits.

          (a)  Financial Statements of Business Acquired.

          VeriSign intends to file by amendment the required historical

          (b)  Pro Forma Financial Information.

condition and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement,
Company and each of the shareholders of Company listed on Schedule 1
                                                          ----------

          E.   The Merger is intended to be treated as a "purchase" for
accounting purposes and a tax-free reorganization pursuant to the provisions of
Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Internal
<PAGE>

Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), by virtue of the provisions of

Section 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code.

          NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

          1.   PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

          1.1  The Merger. The Agreement of Merger will be filed with the
               ----------
Secretary of State of the State of California and the Certificate of Merger will
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as soon as
practicable after the closing of the transactions provided for herein (the
"Closing").  The effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time") shall be
 -------                                            --------------
the time of filing of the Agreement of Merger unless otherwise specified in the
Agreement of Merger.  On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the Agreement of Merger and the Certificate of Merger, Newco will be
merged with and into Company (or Company will be merged with and into Newco in a
forward triangular merger or into Parent in a straight-in merger) in a statutory
merger pursuant to the Agreement of Merger and the Certificate of Merger and in
accordance with applicable provisions of Delaware and California laws as
follows:

               1.1.1  Conversion of Company Shares. Each share of Company
                      ----------------------------
Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, other than shares, if any, for which dissenters rights have been or may be
perfected in compliance with applicable law, will, by virtue of the Merger and
at the Effective Time, and without further action on the part of any holder
thereof, be converted into the Applicable Number (determined in accordance with
Section 1.1.4 hereof) of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common
Stock. Each share of Company Preferred Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares, if any, for which
dissenters rights have been or may be perfected in compliance with applicable
law, will, by virtue of the Merger and at the Effective Time, and without
further action on the part of any holder thereof, be converted into the
Applicable Number (determined in accordance with Section 1.1.4 hereof) of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock. Any right of repurchase by
Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that exists immediately before the
Effective Time shall continue and become a right of Parent to repurchase on the
same terms and conditions (adjusted according to the Applicable Number) as the
shares of Parent Common Stock that are issued at the Effective Time upon
conversion of such shares of Company Common Stock. Company represents in Section
2.3(b) that such repurchase rights are and will be solely related to the vesting
of restricted Company Common Stock issued to Company employees.

               1.1.2  Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the
                      -----------------
contrary contained in this Agreement, any shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock that, as of the Effective Time, are or may become
"dissenting shares" within the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the California
Corporations Code shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.1.1 (or cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.2), and the holder or holders of
such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such
holder or holders in Chapter 13 of the California General Corporation Law;
provided, however, that if the status of any such shares as
- --------  -------
<PAGE>

"dissenting shares," shall not be perfected, or if any such shares lose their
status as "dissenting shares," then, as of the later of the Effective Time or
the time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of such status, such
shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right
to receive (upon surrender of the certificate or certificates representing such
shares) Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.1.1 (and cash in lieu
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.2).

               1.1.3  Conversion of Company Options and Warrants.
                      ------------------------------------------

                      (a)  Effective at the Effective Time, Parent will assume
all outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock (the "Company
                                                               -------
Options"), and each of the Company Options will by its terms be converted into
- -------
an option (a "Parent Option") to purchase that number of shares of Parent Common
              -------------
Stock which equals the number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be
purchased pursuant to the Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Applicable Number (determined in accordance with Section 1.1.4
hereof), such number of shares being rounded down to the nearest whole share.
The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock purchasable under each
Parent Option will be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock under the corresponding Company Options divided by the Applicable Number,
such exercise price being rounded up to the nearest tenth of a cent. All of the
other terms and conditions of each Parent Option will be the same in all
material respects as the corresponding Company Option, including any right to
repurchase shares issued upon exercise of the Company Options. It is the
intention of the parties that the Company Options assumed by Parent qualify
following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section
422 of the Code to the extent the Company Options qualified as incentive stock
options immediately prior to the Effective Time. No cash will be paid in lieu of
fractional shares rounded down pursuant to this Section 1.1.3(a).

                      (b)  Effective as of the Effective Time, Parent will
assume all outstanding warrants to purchase Company Common Stock (the "Company
                                                                       -------
Common Warrants"), and each of the Company Common Warrants will by its terms be
- ---------------
converted into a warrant (a "Parent Warrant") to purchase that number of shares
                             --------------
of Parent Common Stock which equals the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that could be purchased pursuant to the Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable Number (determined in accordance
with Section 1.1.4 hereof), such number of shares being rounded down to the
nearest whole share.  The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
purchasable under each Parent Warrant will be equal to the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock under the corresponding Company Common Warrants
divided by the Applicable Number, such exercise price being rounded up to the
nearest tenth of a cent.  All of the other terms and conditions of each Parent
Warrant will be the same in all material respects as the corresponding Company
Common Warrant.  No cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares rounded down
pursuant to this Section 1.1.3(b).

               1.1.4  Applicable Number.  Unless there is an adjustment to the
                      -----------------
shares to be issued in the Merger pursuant to Section 1.1.5 below, the
"Applicable Number" shall be 0.139953.
 -----------------
<PAGE>

               1.1.5  Adjustments for Capital Changes.  If prior to the Merger,
                      -------------------------------
Parent recapitalizes either through a split-up of the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock into a greater number, or through a combination of such
outstanding shares into a lesser number, or reorganizes, reclassifies or
otherwise changes such outstanding shares into the same or a different number of
shares of other classes (other than through a split-up or combination of shares
provided for in the previous clause), or declares a dividend on its outstanding
shares payable in shares or securities convertible into shares or sets a record
date with respect to any of the foregoing that is before the Effective Time, the
calculation of the Applicable Number will be adjusted appropriately.

               1.1.6  Conversion of Newco Shares. Each share of Newco Common
                      --------------------------
Stock ("Newco Common Stock"), that is issued and outstanding immediately prior
        ------------------
to the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without further action
on the part of the sole stockholder of Newco, be converted into and become one
share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately after
the Effective Time, and the shares of Company Common Stock into which the shares
of Newco Common Stock are so converted shall be the only shares of Company
Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time.

               1.1.7  Forward Triangular or Straight In Merger.  The parties
                      ----------------------------------------
agree that, upon Parent's request, they will amend these documents to cause
Company to merge with and into Newco or Parent; provided, however, that no such
                                                --------  -------
amendment shall increase the tax exposure of Company or any shareholder of
Company and that no such amendment will be made if it would result in any
material delay in the consummation of the Merger as a result of additional third
party consents being required or otherwise; and provided, further, that Company
                                                --------  -------
will be allowed to restate the Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in Section
2) as of the original date of the Agreement to take into account any changes
resulting from any such amendment.

          1.2  Fractional Shares.  No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
               -----------------
will be issued in connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof, the holder of
any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
will receive from Parent, promptly after the Effective Time, an amount of cash
equal to the closing price of Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market
on the last trading day before the Effective Time multiplied by the fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.

          1.3  Escrow Agreement.
               ----------------

               1.3.1   Parent will withhold from the shares of Parent Common
Stock that are issued in the Merger pursuant to Section 1.1.1 (subject to
Sections 1.1.2 and 1.2) and that would otherwise be delivered pursuant to
Section 6.2, 10% of the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
the Merger (the "Escrow Shares") and will deliver certificates representing such
                 -------------
Escrow Shares to Chase Manhattan Bank and Trust Company, National Association or
a similar institution, as escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), together with
                                             ------------
related
<PAGE>

stock transfer powers, to be held by the Escrow Agent as security for the
indemnification obligations under Section 10 and pursuant to the provisions of
the Escrow Agreement.

               1.3.2  The shareholders of Company (the "Company Shareholders"),
                                                        --------------------
by their approval of the Merger and/or their tender pursuant to Section 6.2 of
certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock, will be conclusively deemed to have consented to, approved and agreed to
be personally bound by: (a) the indemnification provisions of Section 10, (b)
the Escrow Agreement, (c) the appointment of Phillipe F. Courtot and Donald R.
Dixon as the representatives of the Company Shareholders (collectively, the
"Representatives") under the Escrow Agreement and as the attorney-in-fact and
 ---------------
agents for and on behalf of the Shareholders as provided in the Escrow Agreement
and (d) the taking by the Representatives of any and all actions and the making
of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the Representatives under
the Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the exercise of the power
to: (a) authorize delivery to Parent of Escrow Shares in satisfaction of
indemnity claims by Parent or any other Indemnified Person (as defined herein)
pursuant to Section 10 hereof and/or the Escrow Agreement; (b) agree to,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, demand arbitration of, and

of the Representatives for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The
Representatives will have unlimited authority and power to act on behalf of the
Shareholders with respect to the Escrow Agreement and the disposition,

of the Representatives. In performing the functions specified in this Agreement

any instrument, contract, license or other agreement governing any Company IP
Right (the "Company IP Rights Agreements"), will not cause the forfeiture or

termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination, of any Company
IP Right or of any Company IP Rights Agreements or materially impair the right
of Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation to use, sell, license or

or an exchange offer or a two step transaction involving a tender offer followed

indirectly, of ownership of all of the then outstanding shares of capital stock
of Company, on terms that the Board of Directors of Company determines, in its
reasonable judgment (after consultation with its financial adviser) to be more
favorable to the Company Shareholders than the terms of the Merger; provided,
                                                                    --------
however, that any such offer shall not be deemed to be a "Superior Offer" if any

recommend any Acquisition Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter of intent or
similar document or any contract, agreement, agreement in principle or

be reasonably expected to lead to, a Superior Offer if (1) neither Company nor
any representative of Company or its Subsidiaries shall have violated any of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.8, (2) the Board of Directors of
Company concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal

pass, only upon delivery of the Company Certificates to Parent's transfer agent
accompanied by the specified documentation and shall be in such form and contain
such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify).  Each holder of any
such shares will then promptly surrender to the transfer agent for cancellation
all Company Certificates for such holder's shares of Company Common Stock and
Company Preferred Stock, accompanied by the completed and signed letter of
transmittal and any other appropriate documentation.  If a Company Certificate
for any such shares or warrant has been lost, the holder of the shares or

in such amount as the transfer agent or Parent may reasonably request.  Upon
surrender of a Company Certificate to the transfer agent for cancellation (or
upon delivery of such affidavit and any such bond) together with a duly executed
letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by
the transfer agent, the transfer agent will issue to such surrendering holder
certificate(s) for the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.1, subject to Section 1.2, less the
shares of Parent Common Stock deposited into escrow pursuant to Section 1.3, and
Parent will distribute any cash payable under Section 1.2.

          6.2.3   All shares of Parent Common Stock (and, if applicable,
cash in lieu of fractional shares) delivered upon the surrender of Company
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof will be delivered to the
registered holder.  After the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock on the stock transfer books of Company.  If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates are presented for transfer or for any other reason,
they will be canceled and exchanged and certificates therefor will be delivered
as provided in this Section 6.2.

          6.2.4   Until Company Certificates representing Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock outstanding prior to the Merger are
surrendered pursuant to Section 6.2.2 above, such certificates will be deemed,
for all purposes, to evidence ownership of

Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock will have been converted and (b) if
applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares.

Warrant, as applicable, (c) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that are
subject to such Parent Option or Company Common Warrant, as applicable, and (d)

Indemnified Persons will exercise their remedies only with respect to the
Escrow Shares and any other assets deposited in escrow
<PAGE>

pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. Except for knowing or willful fraud (a) no
Company Shareholder will have any liability to an Indemnified Person under this
Agreement except to the extent of such Company Shareholder's portion of the
Escrow Shares and any other assets deposited under the Escrow Agreement and (b)
the remedies set forth in this Section 10.3 will be the exclusive remedies of
Parent and the other Indemnified Persons under this Agreement against any
Company Shareholder for any inaccuracy, misrepresentation, breach of, or default
in, any of the representations, warranties or covenants given or made by Company
in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to Section 8.1 or 8.2
hereof by or on behalf of the Company pursuant hereto. No indemnified Person
will be entitled to recover punitive damages pursuant to this Section 10.2
unless (and only to the extent that) the Damages suffered by the Indemnified
Person under Section 10.2 include liability incurred by such Indemnified Person
to any third party for punitive damages. The indemnification provided for in
Section 10.2, and the limitation of liability provided for in the immediately
preceding sentence, shall not apply to any breach of any covenants or
representations made by a Company Shareholder in an Affiliate Agreement or in
the Support Agreement. In addition, the indemnification provided for in Section
10.2 shall not apply unless and until the aggregate Damages for which one or
more Indemnified Persons seeks or has sought indemnification hereunder exceeds a
cumulative aggregate of $1,000,000, in which event Company shall, subject to the
foregoing limitations, be liable to indemnify the Indemnified Persons for all
Damages. The limitations on the indemnification obligations set forth in this
Section 11.3 shall not be applicable to Damages resulting from knowing or
                   ---
willful fraud.

          10.4 Notice. Promptly after Parent becomes aware of the existence of
               ------
any potential claim by an Indemnified Person for indemnity under Section 10.2,
Parent will notify the Representatives of such potential claim in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement. Failure of Parent to give such notice will not affect
any rights or remedies of an Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to
indemnification for Damages except to the extent the Company Shareholders are
materially prejudiced thereby. Prior to the settlement of any claim for which
Parent seeks indemnity under Section 10.2, Parent will provide the
Representatives with the terms of the proposed settlement and a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such terms in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

     11.  MISCELLANEOUS

          11.1 Governing Law.  The internal laws of the State of Delaware
               -------------
(irrespective of its choice of law principles) will govern the validity of this
Agreement, the construction of its terms, and the interpretation and enforcement
of the rights and duties of the parties hereto.

          11.2 Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns.  Neither
               -----------------------------------------------
party hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto.  This Agreement will be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

          11.3 Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement, or the
               ------------
application thereof, is for any reason held to any extent to be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances will be
<PAGE>

interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The
parties further agree to replace such unenforceable provision of this Agreement
with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable
provision.

          11.4  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
                ------------
each of which will be an original as regards any party whose name appears
thereon and all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
This Agreement will become binding when one or more counterparts hereof,
individually or taken together, bear the signatures of both parties reflected
hereon as signatories.

          11.5  Other Remedies.  Except as otherwise provided herein, any
                --------------
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law
on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise
of any other.

          11.6  Amendment and Waivers.  Any term or provision of this
                ---------------------
Agreement may be amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may
be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.
The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof
will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding
breach or default.  This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time prior to the Effective Time and before or after the Company Shareholder
Approval.

          11.7  No Waiver.  The failure of any party to enforce any of the
                ---------
provisions hereof will not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such
party thereafter to enforce such provisions.  The waiver by a party of any
breach hereof or default in the performance hereof will not be deemed to
constitute a waiver of any other default or any succeeding breach or default.
The waiver by any party of the right to enforce any of the provisions hereof on
any occasion will not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party to
enforce such provision on any other occasion.

          11.8  Notices.  Any notice or other communication required or
                -------
