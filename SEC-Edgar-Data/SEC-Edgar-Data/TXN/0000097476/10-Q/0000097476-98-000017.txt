              TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
                      Notes to Financial Statements

Diluted earnings per common share are based on average common and dilutive 
potential common shares outstanding (400.0 and 394.4 million shares for the 
first quarters of 1998 and 1997). 

In the first quarter of 1998, the company's U.S. DRAM manufacturing joint 
venture with Hitachi, Ltd. was discontinued.  In this connection, TI incurred 
a first quarter pretax charge of $219 million, which is included in cost of 
revenues.  Also in this quarter, research and development expense included a 
charge of $25 million for the value of acquired in-process research and 
development from two business acquisitions.  There is no tax offset for $10 
million of this R&D charge. 

The company adopted SFAS No. 130 in the first quarter of 1998.  This standard 
requires disclosure of total nonowner changes in stockholders' equity, which 
is defined as net income plus direct adjustments to stockholders' equity such 
as equity and cash investment adjustments and pension liability adjustments.  
On this basis, these nonowner changes in stockholders' equity, including net 
income, for the first quarter of 1998 and 1997, totaled $4 million and $128 
million.

A new accounting standard, SOP 98-1, was issued in first quarter, 1998, and is 
effective in 1999.  It requires capitalization of the development costs of 
software to be used internally, e.g., for manufacturing or administrative 
processes.  The company, which currently expenses such amounts as incurred, 
expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 1999 for developmental 
costs incurred in that quarter and thereafter.  The effect has not yet been  
determined.

In the first quarter of 1997, the company sold its mobile computing business 
and terminated its digital imaging printing development program.  As a result, 
the company took a pretax charge of $56 million in the first quarter, of which 
$27 million was for severance for involuntary employment reductions worldwide. 
These severance actions were essentially completed by the end of the quarter 
and affected approximately 1,045 employees.  The balance, $29 million, was for 
other costs associated with the business sale and program termination, 
including vendor cancellation and lease charges.

The statements of income, statements of cash flows and balance sheet at March 
31, 1998, are not audited but reflect all adjustments which are of a normal 
recurring nature and are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair 
statement of the results of the periods shown.

ITEM 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations.

The Registrant (the "company" or "TI") announced that revenues and orders for 
digital signal processing solutions (DSPS) increased in the first quarter from 
the same period a year ago, driven by record orders for wireless 
communications.  However, total TI first quarter revenues and orders were down 
from first quarter 1997, primarily because of severe price declines of dynamic 
random access memory (DRAM) chips.

Average unit prices for DRAMs dropped 60 percent from the first quarter of 
1997 to the first quarter of 1998, resulting in a loss in TI's memory 
operations that was more than double that of the year-ago quarter. The memory 
operating loss was $129 million, an increase of $0.08 per share from the 
memory loss in the fourth quarter of 1997.

The turmoil in Asia and customer inventory reductions during the first quarter 
of 1998 affected semiconductor product areas in varying degrees.  However, TI 
benefited from its diverse product portfolio as gross profit margins improved 
both year-to-year and from the fourth quarter of 1997, excluding special 
charges.

TI's orders were $2137 million, down from $2500 million in the first quarter 
of 1997.  Net revenues for the first quarter of 1998 were $2187 million, 
compared with $2263 million in the first quarter of 1997.  Revenues in the 
first quarter of 1997 included revenues from TI businesses that have since 
been sold, primarily software.  Excluding sold businesses, TI's revenues were 
down 1 percent from a year ago.

Results for first quarter include special charges of $244 million, primarily 
for discontinuing the DRAM manufacturing joint venture with Hitachi, Ltd.  As 
previously announced, TI purchased the operating assets of the joint venture. 
Last year's first quarter results included a special charge of $56 million, 
primarily related to severance actions and other costs associated with the 
sale of TI's mobile computing business.

Excluding the special charges: Profit from operations (PFO) for the quarter 
was $222 million, about flat with $227 million in the year-ago quarter.  TI's 
operating margin was up slightly to 10.2 percent, versus 10.0 percent in the 
year-ago quarter.  Income for the quarter was $176 million, up from the $138 
million in the first quarter of 1997, primarily because of improved net 
interest.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.44, compared with $0.35 in 
the first quarter of 1997.  

Including the effect of the special charges, the loss from operations for the 
quarter was $22 million, compared with a profit from operations of $171 
million a year ago.  Income was $11 million, compared with $102 million; EPS 
was $0.03, compared with $0.26.

Over the quarter, TI announced a number of strategic actions and developments 
to further its leadership in digital signal processing solutions.  
Acquisitions during the quarter included Spectron Microsystems, which brings 
TI additional expertise in DSP software tools, and Oasix and Arisix 
corporations, which provide integrated design for hard disk drive products. 


                                       6
New product developments in the quarter included three ADSL chipsets that use 
digital signal processors to speed Internet access.  Most recently, TI 
announced a new DSP architecture that combines digital signal processing with 
microcontroller functions, primarily targeting mass storage applications such 
as hard disk drives and digital video disks.  The ramp-up of TI's 'C6x DSP 
chip continues to meet strong market acceptance, with a design-in rate five 
times faster than any previous generation of TI DSP.

In addition to the joint venture with Hitachi referenced earlier, TI also 
announced a definitive agreement for the Acer Group to purchase TI's shares in 
the TI-Acer semiconductor memory chip joint venture, located in Taiwan.  The 
TI-Acer transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and TI expects 
to recover its original investment.  TI and other joint-venture shareholders 
continue to explore further measures with respect to the joint-venture 
structures.

OUTLOOK

TI now believes the world semiconductor market is likely to grow 5 percent or 
less in 1998, in view of ongoing inventory reductions by electronic end-
equipment manufacturers, sharply lower DRAM prices, weakness in Asia and 
depreciation of the yen.  As a result, TI expects to see continued pressure on 
its semiconductor revenues and margins in the second quarter of 1998.  

While the semiconductor market in the near term will continue to be affected 
by pressure on DRAM prices and weakness in Asia, end-equipment demand in the 
U.S. is relatively healthy and Europe remains strong.  These strengths, 
combined with possible stabilization in the Asia Pacific region, could set the 
stage for stronger semiconductor growth in 1999 and beyond.

In the market sectors most important to TI, the company expects about 30 
percent growth in DSP and about 20 percent in mixed-signal for 1998, fueled by 
wireless and networking applications.  Over the next few years, these end-
equipment markets are expected to grow in excess of 20 percent annually.  
Based on the projected strong growth of end-equipment markets and the major 
role that communications will play in such growth, TI remains positive about 
the longer-term prospects of the semiconductor industry.

TI will continue to take actions to align costs with demand.  The company now 
plans to hold capital spending for 1998 at $1.2 billion, essentially flat with 
1997.

FIRST QUARTER 1998 SEGMENT REVIEW

NOTE: UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THIS REPORT ARE FROM 
CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND EXCLUDE SPECIAL CHARGES DETAILED EARLIER IN THIS 
REPORT.

SEMICONDUCTOR

Semiconductor orders declined by 17 percent in the first quarter versus the 
year-ago quarter primarily due to weakness in memory, and declined by 3 
percent from the fourth quarter of 1997, with about half the decline due to 
memory and the balance from softness in modem and hard disk drive orders.  


                                       7
Semiconductor revenues were down 3 percent from the first quarter of 1997.  
From the fourth quarter, revenues were down 12 percent, with about half of the 
decrease related to weakness in memory and most of the balance reflecting 
customer inventory corrections in electronic end equipment.  Excluding memory, 
semiconductor revenues were up 7 percent from a year ago, primarily because of 
an increase in digital signal processing solutions. 

Profit from operations for the quarter was $229 million, down 18 percent from 
the year-ago quarter, primarily because of lower DRAM prices.  Compared with 
the fourth quarter of 1997, profit from operations declined by $125 million, 
with about $50 million related to the weakness in memory, and most of the 
balance from lower revenues in other semiconductor areas, primarily due to 
softness in demand from OEMs.  Operating margins were down from the year-ago 
quarter by about 2 percentage points, primarily because of lower DRAM prices.

Orders for digital signal processing solutions were up from both the year-ago 
quarter and the fourth quarter, driven by wireless.  Revenues for DSPS were up 
18 percent from a year ago, though down 8 percent from the fourth quarter, 
primarily due to softness in demand from OEMs.  DSPS accounted for almost 50 
percent of semiconductor revenues in the quarter.

Memory continued to be affected by declining DRAM prices, which caused revenue 
to decline by $157 million from the year-ago quarter.  From the fourth 
quarter, revenues declined by $126 million, with about one-third of the 
decrease due to price declines and the balance due to lower shipments.  As a 
result, memory revenues were 12 percent of total semiconductor revenues.

MATERIALS & CONTROLS

TI's Materials & Controls (M&C) business reported first quarter results of 
$242 million in revenues, up 4 percent from the first quarter of 1997.  
Progress from continued emphasis on the "best cost producer" strategy was seen 
in profit from operations of $36 million, up 40 percent from a year ago. 
Operating margins were 14.8 percent in the first quarter, a gain of 3.7 
percentage points from the year-ago quarter.

M&C's automotive sensor market continues to participate in high growth 
segments, particularly in Europe where the growth of air-conditioning and 
automatic transmissions is accelerating for local markets.  TIRIS (TM) also 
continued to broaden its served markets in automatic customer recognition 
systems, with pilot programs with Shell International in Europe and the next 
phase of U.S. market fanout of the Mobil Speedpass (TM) program.

EDUCATIONAL & PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS

Revenues and orders were up for the Educational & Productivity Solutions 
(E&PS) business from a year ago, primarily because of increased shipments of 
graphing calculators.  Revenues increased to $76 million, compared to $69 
million in the year-ago quarter, while profit from operations remained flat at 
$1 million, reflecting seasonal patterns.

The E&PS business continues to make advances in its calculator line.  During 
the quarter, the business introduced the TI-73, an electronically upgradable 


                                       8
calculator designed for middle grades, and the TI-89, a powerful calculator 
for advanced mathematics for high school and college students.  Response among 
educators has been enthusiastic.

DIGITAL IMAGING

Shipments increased in TI's digital imaging business to set an all-time high. 
The increase in revenues helped to reduce the loss in this emerging business. 

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The income tax rate for the first quarter of 1998 was 34 percent, which is the 
estimated rate for the full year.

During the first quarter of 1998, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term 
investments decreased by $654 million to $2366 million.  The discontinuance of 
the joint venture with Hitachi and the acquisition of those operating assets 
required $281 million of cash, and $91 million of cash was used to purchase 
the remaining outstanding shares of Amati Communications Corporation's common 
stock. 

First quarter 1998 cash flow from operating activities, net of additions to 
property, plant, and equipment, was negative $429 million; and first quarter 
capital expenditures totaled $384 million, compared to $225 million in the 
first quarter of 1997.

At the end of the first quarter, the debt-to-total-capital ratio was .18, down 
from the year-end value of .19.

Depreciation for the first quarter of 1998 was $275 million, compared to $246 
million in the year-ago period.  Depreciation for 1998 is projected at $1.2 
billion.

                                  ARTICLE II
                            Meetings of Stockholders
          Section 1.  Annual Meetings.  An annual meeting of the stockholders 
of the Corporation shall be held on the third Thursday in April in each year or 
on such other date as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors, 
at such hour as may be specified in the notice thereof, for the purpose of 
electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may 
properly be brought before such meeting.  If any annual meeting shall not be 
held on the day designated or as provided herein, the Board of Directors shall 
cause the meeting of the stockholders to be held as soon thereafter as 

                                       1

convenient for the election of such directors.  A failure to hold the annual 
meeting of the stockholders at the designated time or to elect a sufficient 
number of directors to conduct the business of the Corporation shall not affect 
otherwise valid corporate acts and shall not work any forfeiture or dissolution 
of the Corporation. 
          Section 2.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the stockholders, 
for any purpose or purposes, may be called at any time by the Chairman of the 
Board, President or the Board of Directors, and shall be called by the Chairman 
of the Board, President or the Secretary at the request in writing of a 
majority of the Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided by law or in 
the Certificate of Incorporation or any amendment thereto.
          Section 3.  Place of Meeting.  All meetings of the stockholders for 
the election of directors shall be held in the City of Dallas, State of Texas, 
at such place within such City as may be fixed from time to time by the Board 
of Directors, or at such other place either within or without the State of 
Delaware as shall be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and 
stated in the notice of the meeting.  All other meetings of the stockholders 
shall be held at such places, within or without the State of Delaware, as may

or fixed in the respective notices or waivers of notice thereof.
          Section 4.  Notice of Meetings.  Except as otherwise expressly 
required by law or by these By-Laws, notice of each meeting of the 
stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than ten (10) 
nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, to each 
stockholder of record of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting by 

                                       2

delivering a written or printed notice thereof to him personally or by 
depositing such notice in the United States mail postage prepaid, directed to 
the stockholder at his address as it appears upon the records of the 
Corporation.  Every such notice shall state the place, date and hour of the 
meeting and, if the meeting be special, briefly, the purpose or purposes 
thereof.  Except when expressly required by law, no publication of any notice 
of a meeting of the stockholders shall be required; and except when expressly 
required by law, no notice of any adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the 
Corporation need be given.
          Section 5.  Quorum.  At all meetings of the stockholders (except 
where otherwise provided by law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or by 
these By-Laws) stockholders holding of record a majority of the shares of stock 
of the Corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present 
in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of 
business.  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law, in the absence of a 
quorum at any such meeting or any adjournment or adjournments thereof, a 
majority in voting interest of those present in person or by proxy and voting 
thereon may adjourn such meeting from time to time, until a quorum shall be 
present, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, except that if 
the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment 
a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned 
meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting.  At 
any adjourned meeting at which a quorum may be present any business may be 
transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally 
called.  The absence from any meeting of stockholders holding the number of 

                                       3

shares of stock of the Corporation having voting powers required by the laws of 
the State of Delaware or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-
Laws for action upon any given matter shall not prevent action at such meeting 
upon any other matter or matters which may properly come before the meeting, if 
there shall be present thereat in person or by proxy stockholders entitled to 
vote thereat holding the number of shares of stock of the Corporation having 
voting power required in respect of such other matter or matters. 
          Section 6.  Voting.  Except as otherwise expressly provided by law or 
by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, each stockholder of 
the Corporation shall, at each meeting of the stockholders, be entitled to one 
vote in person or by proxy for each share of the stock of the Corporation 
having voting powers held by him and registered in his name on the books of the 
Corporation on the date fixed pursuant to the provisions of Section 5 of 
Article IX of these By-Laws as the record date for the determination of 
stockholders who shall be entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting.  
Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation, or to another corporation 
if a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of 
such other corporation is held by the Corporation, shall not be voted nor 
counted for quorum purposes.  At all meetings of the stockholders all matters 
except those the manner of deciding upon which shall otherwise be expressly 
regulated by law or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by these By-Laws, 
shall be decided by the vote of a majority in voting interest of the 
stockholders present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote thereat, a 
quorum being present.  The vote for directors, and upon the demand of any 
stockholder, the vote upon any question before the meeting shall be by written 
ballot.
                                       4

          Section 7.  List of Stockholders.  It shall be the duty of the 
Secretary or other officer of the Corporation who shall have charge of its 
stock ledger, either directly or through a transfer agent or transfer clerk 
appointed by the Board of Directors, to prepare and make, at least ten (10) 
days before every meeting of the stockholders a complete alphabetically 
arranged list of the stockholders showing the address of each stockholder and 
the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list 
shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to 
the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) 
days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting 
is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, 
if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.  The list 
shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the 
whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.  
The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders 
entitled to examine the stock ledger, the list required by this section or the

information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the 
eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company.
          The Chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the facts warrant, 
determine and declare to the meeting that a nomination was not made in 
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9 of Article II, and the 
defective nomination shall be disregarded.

determine and declare to the meeting that business was not properly brought 
before the meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10 of

the Board of Directors as soon as circumstances permit for the purpose of 
filling vacancies on the Board of Directors and its Committees and to take such 
other action as may be appropriate and (2) if the Emergency Management

the same office on the same day the person or persons to be deemed a director 
or directors shall be the person or persons with the longest continuous period 
of service uninterrupted by leave of absence with the Corporation. 
          (c)  The Board of Directors, either before or during any such

thereafter as practicable, at the place where the meeting of stockholders for 
the election of directors was held.  Notice of such meeting or of any 
adjournment thereof need not be given.  Such meeting may be held at any other 
time or place which shall be specified in a notice given as hereinafter 
provided for special meetings of the Board of Directors or in a waiver of 
notice thereof in accordance with these By-Laws.

time to time, by resolution, determine.  If no other place be fixed by 
resolution for such regular meetings they shall be held at the general office 
of the Corporation in the City of Dallas, State of Texas. Except as otherwise 
provided by law or by these By-Laws, notices of regular meetings need not be 
given.  The time and place of any regular meeting may be changed on three days'

                                       13

of directors at the time in office.  A notice shall be given as hereinafter in 
this Section provided of each such special meeting, in which shall be stated 
the time and place of such meeting, but except as otherwise expressly provided 
by law or by these By-Laws, the purposes thereof need not be stated in such 
notice.  Except as otherwise provided by law, notice of each such meeting shall 
be mailed to each director, addressed to him at his residence or usual place of 
business, at least three days before the day on which such meeting is to be 
held, or shall be sent addressed to him at such place by telegraph, cable or 
wireless or be delivered personally or by telephone not later than the day 
before the day on which such meeting is to be held.  Notice of any meeting of 
the Board need not, however, be given to any director, if waived by him at any 
time, whether before or after the meeting, in writing or by telegraph, cable or 
wireless, or if he shall be present at such meeting; and any special meeting of 
the Board shall be a legal meeting without any notice thereof having been given

Section 1 of Article IV, Section 4 of Article V, and Article XIV of these By-

Certificate of Incorporation, the act of a majority of the directors present 
shall be the act of the Board of Directors.  Members of the Board of Directors 
may participate in any meeting of such Board by means of conference telephone 
or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons participating 

                                       14

in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in the meeting shall 
constitute presence in person at such meeting.  In the absence of a quorum at 
any meeting, it may be adjourned, from time to time, until a quorum shall be 
present thereat.  Notice of any adjourned meeting need not be given.  The 
directors shall act only as a Board and the individual directors shall have no 
power as such.
          Section 13.  Compensation.  The Board of Directors may at any time 
and from time to time by resolution provide that a specified sum shall be paid 
to any director of the Corporation or to any director member of any Committee 
who shall not otherwise be in the employ of the Corporation or of any 
subsidiary of the Corporation, either as his annual compensation as such 
director, member of such committee or as compensation for his attendance at any 
annual, regular, or special meeting of the Board or of such committee or other 
activities as a director; and the Board of Directors may also likewise provide 
that the Corporation shall reimburse each such director or member of such 
committee for any expenses paid by him on account of his attendance at any such 
meeting or his engaging in other activities as a director.  Unless otherwise 
expressly provided by resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, none of the 
directors and none of the members of any committee of directors of the 
Corporation contemplated by these By-Laws or otherwise provided for by 
resolution of the Board of Directors shall, as such, receive any stated 
compensation for his services.  Nothing in this Section shall be construed to 
preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity and 
receiving compensation therefor.

restrictions upon, the Secretary. Each Assistant Secretary shall perform such 
other duties as from time to time may be assigned to him by the President, the 
Secretary, or the Board of Directors. 
          Section 13.  The Treasurer.  The Treasurer shall be under the 
direction of the officer who has been designated by the Board of Directors.  
The principal financial officer of the Corporation may also hold the position 
of Treasurer if so approved by the Board of Directors.  If required by the 
Board of Directors, the Treasurer shall give a bond for the faithful discharge 
of his duties in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board of 
Directors shall determine (and in the event such bond be required, a new bond 
shall be taken at least every six years).  The Treasurer shall have charge and 
custody of, and be responsible for, all funds, securities, notes, valuable 
effects and financial records of the Corporation, receive and give receipt for 
moneys due and payable to the Corporation from any sources whatsoever; when 
necessary or proper he shall endorse on behalf of the Corporation for 
collection, checks, notes and other obligations and shall deposit the same to 
the credit of the Corporation in such bank or banks or depositary or 
depositaries as the Board of Directors may designate; he shall cause such funds 
of the Corporation to be disbursed by checks or drafts on the authorized banks 
or depositaries of the Corporation signed as provided in these By-Laws or by 

                                       22

resolution of the Board of Directors; he shall be responsible for the accuracy 
of the amounts of, and cause to be preserved, proper vouchers for all moneys so 
disbursed; he shall enter or cause to be entered regularly in the books of the 
Corporation, to be kept by him or under his supervision for that purpose, a 
full and accurate account of all the moneys received and paid by him on account 
of the Corporation; he shall render to the Board of Directors, the Chairman of 
the Board, or the President, whenever they shall require him so to do, a 
statement of the cash account and such other financial statements as may be 
prepared from the financial records, and as soon as may be practicable after 
the close of each fiscal year make and submit to the Board of Directors like 
report or reports for such fiscal year; and in general perform all the duties 
incident to the office of Treasurer, and such other duties as from time to time 
may be assigned to him by the Board of Directors or the President. The Board of 
Directors may from time to time delegate to another officer or person any of 
the duties usually performed by the Treasurer to the extent permitted by law.
          Section 14.  The Assistant Treasurer.  If required by the Board of 
Directors, the Assistant Treasurer shall give a bond for the faithful discharge 
of his duties in such sum and with such surety or sureties as the Board of 
Directors shall determine (and in the event such bond be required, a new bond 
shall be taken at least every six years).  At the request of the Treasurer or 
in the event of his absence or inability to act, the Assistant Treasurer or, if 
there be more than one, any of the Assistant Treasurers, shall (unless the 
Board directs otherwise) perform the duties of the Treasurer and, when so 
acting, shall have all the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions 
upon, the Treasurer.  Each Assistant Treasurer shall perform such other duties 

                                       23

as from time to time may be assigned to him by the President, the Treasurer, or 
the Board of Directors.
          Section 15.  Salaries.  The salaries of all officers of the 
Corporation shall be determined or provided for from time to time by the Board 
of Directors.  No officer shall be prevented from receiving any such salary 
because he is also a member of the Board of Directors.

                                  ARTICLE VI
                 Limitation of Liability and Indemnification of
                        Directors, Officers and Certain
                       Representatives of the Corporation
          Section 1.  Limitation of Liability.  No person shall be liable to 
the Corporation for any loss or damage suffered by it on account of any action 
taken or omitted to be taken in good faith as a director, member of a 
directors' committee or officer of the Corporation, if such person exercised or 
used the same degree of care and skill as a prudent man would have exercised or 
used under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.  Without 
limitation on the foregoing, any such person shall be deemed to have exercised 
or used such degree of care and skill if he took or omitted to take such action 
in reliance in good faith upon advice of counsel for the Corporation, or the 
books of account or other records of the Corporation, or reports or information 
made or furnished to the Corporation by  any officials,  accountants, 
engineers, agents or  employees of the Corporation, or by an independent 
certified public accountant or auditor, engineer, appraiser or other expert 
employed by the Corporation and selected with reasonable care by the Board of 

                                       24

Directors, by any such committee or by an authorized officer of the 
Corporation.
          Section 2.  Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees. The 
Corporation shall indemnify, in the manner and to the full extent permitted by 
the laws of the State of Delaware, any former or present director, officer or 
employee of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of the Corporation (or the 
estate of any such person) who was or is a party to, or is threatened to be 
made a party to, any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or 
proceeding, whether or not by or in the right of the Corporation, and whether 
civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise, by reason of the 
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the 
Corporation, or is or was serving any other enterprise at the request of the 
Corporation; provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such 
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part 
thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was 
authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The 
Corporation may, to the full extent permitted by the laws of the State of 
Delaware, purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any such person against 
any liability which may be asserted against him.  To the full extent permitted 
by the laws of the State of Delaware, the indemnification provided herein shall 
include expenses (including attorney's fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid 
in settlement.  In the manner provided by law, any such expenses may be, and 
any such expenses incurred by any former or present director or officer of the 
Corporation shall be, paid by the Corporation in advance of the final 
disposition of such action, suit or proceeding.  The indemnification provided 

                                       25

herein shall not be deemed to limit the right of the Corporation to indemnify 
any other person for any such expenses to the full extent permitted by law, nor 
shall it be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any person seeking 
indemnification from the Corporation may be entitled under any agreement, vote 
of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in 
his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such 
office.  No amendment to or repeal of this Section 2 of Article VI shall apply 
or be effective to limit or reduce the indemnification rights provided under 
this Section 2 of Article VI with respect to any acts or omissions occurring 
prior to such amendment or repeal.

                                 ARTICLE VII
                    Contracts, Checks, Drafts, Bank Accounts,
                            Books and Records, etc.
          Section 1.  Execution of Contracts.  The Board of Directors may 
authorize any officer or officers or agent or agents of the Corporation to 
enter into any contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name and 
on behalf of the Corporation, and such authority may be general or confined to 
specific instances; and, unless so authorized by the Board of Directors, no 
officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the 
Corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render 
it liable pecuniarily for any purpose or to any amount.
          Section 2.  Loans.  No loan shall be contracted on behalf of the 
Corporation, and no negotiable paper shall be issued in its name, unless 
authorized (i) by the Board of Directors, or (ii) by a Committee of the Board 

                                       26

if the Board of Directors has delegated to any such Committee the power to make 
such authorizations.  When so authorized any officer or agent of the 
Corporation may effect loans and advances at any time for the Corporation from 
any bank, trust company or other institution, or from any firm, corporation or 
individual, and for such loans and advances may make, execute and deliver 
promissory notes or other evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, and, 
when authorized so to do by the Board of Directors, and, if required by law, by 
the stockholders, as security for the payment of any and all loans, advances, 
indebtedness and liabilities of the Corporation, may mortgage, pledge, 
hypothecate or transfer any real or personal property at any time held by the 
Corporation and to that end execute deeds of trust, and instruments of mortgage 
or pledge, or otherwise transfer said property.
          Section 3.  Checks, Drafts, etc.  All checks, drafts, orders for the 
payment of money, obligations and bills of exchange shall be signed or endorsed 
(except endorsements for collection for the account of the Corporation or for 
deposit to its credit) by such officer or officers, employee or employees or 
agent or agents of the Corporation and in such manner as shall from time to 
time be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.  Each of such 
officers and employees shall give such bond, if any, as the Board of Directors 
shall determine.
          Section 4.  Deposits.  All funds of the Corporation not otherwise 
employed shall be deposited from time to time to the credit of the Corporation 
in one or more of such banks, trust companies or other depositaries as the 
Board of Directors may select or as may be selected by any officer or officers 
or agent or agents of the Corporation to whom power in that respect shall have 

                                       27

been delegated by the Board of Directors.  For the purpose of deposit and for 
the purpose of collection for the account of the Corporation, checks, drafts 
and other orders for the payment of money which are payable to the order of the 
Corporation may be endorsed, assigned and delivered by any officer or agent of 
the Corporation to whom such power is so delegated. 
          Section 5.  General and Special Bank Accounts.  The Board of 
Directors may from time to time authorize the opening and keeping of general 
and special bank accounts with one or more of such banks,  trust companies or  
other depositaries  as the Board of Directors may select or as may be selected 
by any officer or officers, agent or agents of the Corporation to whom power in 
that respect shall have been delegated by the Board of Directors.  The Board of 
Directors may make such special rules and regulations with respect to such bank 
accounts, not inconsistent with the provisions of these By-Laws, as it may deem 
expedient.
          Section 6.  Proxies in Respect of Stock or Other Securities of Other 
Corporations.  Unless otherwise provided by resolutions adopted by the Board of 
Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the President, any Executive Vice 
President, any Group Vice President, any Senior Vice President, any Vice 
President, the Secretary or the Treasurer of the Corporation, or any one or 
more of them shall have full power and authority to exercise in the name and on 
behalf of the Corporation all the powers and rights, including the right to 
vote and consent, which the Corporation may have as the holder of stock or 
other securities in any other corporation, and from time to time to appoint an 
attorney or attorneys or an agent or agents, or proxy or proxies with like 
power and authority in respect of such stock or other securities, and may 

                                       28

instruct the person or persons so appointed as to the manner of exercising such 
powers and rights, and may execute or cause to be executed in the name and on 
behalf of the Corporation and under its corporate seal, or otherwise, all such 
written proxies or other instruments as he or they may deem necessary or proper 
in order that the Corporation may exercise its said powers and rights.  The 
Board of Directors from time to time may by resolution confer like powers and 
authority upon any other person or persons.

                                 ARTICLE VIII
                               Books and Records
          The books and records of the Corporation may be kept outside of the 
State of Delaware, at the general office of the Corporation in Dallas, Texas, 
or at such other place or places as may be from time to time designated or 
selected by the Board of Directors. 

                                   ARTICLE IX
                           Shares and Their Transfer;
                              Examination of Books
          Section 1.  Certificates for Stock.  Every owner of stock of the 
Corporation shall be entitled to have a certificate in such form not 
inconsistent with the Certificate of Incorporation as the Board of Directors 
shall prescribe, certifying the number and class of shares of stock of the 
Corporation owned by him. The certificates representing shares of the 
respective classes of such stock (if there be more than one) shall state the 
name of the person owning the shares represented thereby, shall be numbered in 

                                       29

the order in which they shall be issued, and shall be signed in the name of the 
Corporation by the Chairman of the Board or the President or an Executive Vice 
President or a Group Vice President or a Senior Vice President or a Vice 
President or by the Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Treasurer or an 
Assistant Secretary of the Corporation and its seal shall be affixed thereto; 
provided, however, that where such certificate is countersigned by (1) a 
transfer agent other than the Corporation or its employee, or (2) a registrar 
other than the Corporation or its employee, if the Board of Directors shall by 
resolution so authorize, any of the signatures of the foregoing officers of the 
Corporation and the seal of the Corporation may be facsimile.  In case any 
officer of the Corporation, transfer agent or registrar who has signed, or 
whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased 
to be such officer, transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is 
issued, such certificate may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect 
as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.  
The name of the person owning the shares represented by each certificate, the 
number of shares, and the date of issue shall be entered on the stock ledger of 
the Corporation.  Every certificate surrendered to the corporation for exchange 
or transfer shall be cancelled and a new certificate or certificates shall not 
be issued in exchange for any existing certificate, until such existing 
certificate shall have been so cancelled, except in cases provided for in 
Section 4 of Article IX.
          Section 2.  Transfers of Stock.  Transfers of shares of stock of the 
Corporation shall be made only on the books of the Corporation by the 
registered holder thereof, or by his attorney thereunto authorized by power of 

                                       30

attorney duly executed and filed with the Secretary of the Corporation, or with 
a transfer clerk or a transfer agent appointed as provided in Section 3 of 
Article IX, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates for such shares 
properly endorsed and the payment of all taxes thereon.  The person in whose 
name shares of stock are registered on the books of the Corporation shall be 
deemed and treated as the owner thereof for all purposes; and the Corporation 
shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in 
such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall 
have express or other notice thereof, save as expressly provided by the laws of 
the State of Delaware. 
          Section 3.  Regulations.  The Board of Directors may make such rules 
and regulations as it may deem expedient, not inconsistent with these By-Laws, 
concerning the issue, transfer and registration of certificates for shares of 
the stock of the Corporation.  It may appoint one or more transfer clerks or 
one or more transfer agents and one or more registrars, and may require all 
certificates of stock to bear the signature or signatures of any of them.
          Section 4.  Lost, Destroyed, Stolen, and Mutilated Certificates.  The 
holder of any stock of the Corporation shall immediately notify the Corporation 
of any loss, destruction, theft, or mutilation of the certificate therefor, and 
the Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the place of any 
certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, destroyed, 
stolen, or mutilated, upon the surrender of the mutilated certificate, or in 
the case of loss, destruction, or theft of the certificate, upon satisfactory 
proof of such loss, destruction, or theft.  The Board of Directors may, in its 
discretion, as a condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate, 

                                       31

require the owner of the lost, destroyed, or stolen certificate or his legal 
representatives to give the Corporation a bond in such sum, limited or 
unlimited, and in such form and with such surety or sureties, as the Board 
shall in its uncontrolled discretion determine, to indemnify the Corporation 
against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, 
destruction, or theft of any such certificate, or the issuance of such new 
certificates. 
          Section 5.  Fixing Record Date.  In order that the Corporation may 
determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of 
stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to express consent to corporate 
action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any 
dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to 
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock 
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, 
in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty nor less than ten 
days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty days prior to any 
other action.
          A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to 
vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the 
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record 
date for the adjourned meeting. 

                                   ARTICLE X
                                      Seal
          The corporate seal of the Corporation shall be in the form of a 
circle and shall bear the full name of the Corporation, the state and year of 

                                       32
incorporation, and the words "Corporate Seal."  Said seal may be used by 
causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise 
reproduced. The seal shall be retained by the Secretary.  A duplicate of the 
seal may be kept and used by the Treasurer, by an Assistant Secretary or 
Assistant Treasurer, or by any other employee authorized by resolution of the 
Board of Directors.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                   Fiscal Year
          The fiscal year of the Corporation shall begin on the first day of 
January and end on the thirty-first day of December in each year.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                          Notices and Waivers Thereof
          Whenever under the provisions of the law of the State of Delaware, of 
the Certificate of Incorporation, or these By-Laws notice of any nature is 
required to be given to any director, officer or stockholder, unless otherwise 
provided by law or expressly provided by these By-Laws, such notice may be 
given personally, or it may be given in writing by depositing the same in the 
post office or a letter box maintained and kept by the United States Government 
in a postpaid sealed envelope addressed to such director, officer or 
stockholder at such address as appears upon the books of the Corporation, or, 
in default of other address, to such director, officer or stockholder at the 
general post office in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, and such notice shall 
be deemed to be given at the time when the same shall be thus mailed; a waiver 

                                       33

of such notice in writing signed by the person or persons entitled to such 
notice, or a telegram, cable or wireless sent by such person, whether before or 
after the time stated therein shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance 
of a person at a meeting of stockholders shall constitute a waiver of notice of 
such meeting, except when the stockholder attends a meeting for the express 
purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of 
any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither 
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special 
meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice.

                                 ARTICLE XIII
                          Annual Financial Statement
          The Board of Directors shall cause to be published and submitted to 
the stockholders, at least fifteen days in advance of their annual meeting, the 
Corporation's annual financial statement covering the previous fiscal year, and 
containing such other information and data as the Board of Directors may deem 
appropriate. 

                                  ARTICLE XIV
                                   Amendments
          These By-Laws, as they shall be at any time and whether or not 
previously altered, amended or added to, may be made, altered, amended or 
repealed from time to time by the Board of Directors by the affirmative vote 
of a majority of the authorized number of directors at any regular or special 
meeting of directors if notice of the proposed change was contained in the 

                                       34

notice of such meeting.  The stockholders also, by the affirmative vote of a 
majority of the stock issued, outstanding and entitled to vote may from time 
to time make, alter, amend or repeal the By-Laws at any regular or special 
meeting if notice of the proposed change was contained in the notice of the 
meeting; and any addition, alteration, amendment or repeal effected by the 
Board of Directors may be altered, amended or repealed by the stockholders in 
the manner hereinabove set forth.

                                                                  -------------
                 TEXAS INSTRUMENTS RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT PLAN
                                FOR DIRECTORS

                          As Amended April 16, 1998


The Texas Instruments Restricted Stock Unit Plan for Directors is designed to 
enhance the ability of the Company to attract and retain exceptionally 
qualified individuals and to encourage them to acquire a proprietary interest 
in the growth and performance of the Company.

For purposes of this Plan, unless otherwise indicated, the term "Company" 
shall mean Texas Instruments Incorporated.  

Eligibility

All directors of the Company who are not during the term of this Plan and who 
have not previously been officers or employees of the Company shall participate 
in this Plan.  

Definitions

As used in this Plan, the following terms shall have the meanings set forth:

(a)     "Fair Market Value" shall mean, with respect to any Shares, the simple 
        average of the high and low prices of such Shares on the date of grant 
        of Restricted Stock Units (or, if there is no trading on the New York 
        Stock Exchange on such date, then on the first previous date on which 
        there is such trading) as reported in "New York Stock Exchange 
        Composite Transactions" in "The Wall Street Journal";

(b)     "Restricted Stock Units" shall mean any Units  granted under 
        paragraphs (a)  or (b) under the heading "Grants of Restricted Stock 
        Units" set forth below; and

(c)     "Shares" shall mean shares of the common stock of the Company, $1.00 
        par value.

Administration of Plan

This Plan shall be administered by the Secretary of the Company (the 
"Secretary").  The Secretary shall have full power and authority to construe, 
interpret and administer the Plan.  The Secretary may issue rules and 
regulations for administration of the Plan.  All decisions of the Secretary 
shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all parties, including the Company, 
the stockholders and the directors.  In the event of the absence or inability 
of the Corporate Secretary, any Assistant Secretary shall have the authority to 
act in his place.


                                       1

Subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law, the Secretary shall have 
full power and authority to:  (i) interpret and administer the Plan and any 
instrument or agreement relating to, or Restricted Stock Units granted under, 
the Plan;  (ii) establish, amend, suspend or waive such rules and regulations 
and appoint such agents as the Secretary shall deem appropriate for the proper 
administration of the Plan; and (iii) make any other determination and take any 
other action that the Secretary deems necessary or desirable for the 
administration of this Plan.  

Restricted Stock Units Available for Grant

Subject to adjustment as provided below:

(a)     Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Restricted Stock Units.  Any Shares 
delivered pursuant to the settlement of Restricted Stock Units shall consist of 
treasury Shares.

(b)     Adjustments.  In the event that the Secretary shall determine that any 
dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other 
securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock 
split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, 
repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance 
of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the 
Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares 
such that an adjustment is determined by the Secretary to be appropriate in 
order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits 
intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Secretary shall, in such 
manner as he or she may deem equitable, adjust  the number of  outstanding 
Restricted Stock Units; provided, however, that no fractional Restricted Stock 
Units shall be issued or outstanding hereunder.  Notwithstanding any such 
corporate transaction or event, no adjustment shall be made in the number of 
Restricted Stock Units to be granted to new directors who are elected after the 
occurrence of any such corporate transaction or event. 

Grants of Restricted Stock Units

(a)     Initial Grants of Restricted Stock Units.  The Company, as of the 
        effective date of this Plan, shall grant to each then current director 
        of the Company 1000 Restricted Stock Units.  Each Restricted Stock Unit 
        shall be paid or settled by the issuance of one Share upon the 
        termination of such recipient's service as a director of the Company, 
        provided that such termination of service shall have occurred (i) after 
        the age at which a director is ineligible under the Company's by-laws 
        to stand for reelection to the Board, (ii) after the completion of at 
        least eight years of service as a director of the Company or (iii) as a 
        result of the death or disability of the director.  In the event such 
        recipient's membership on the Board of Directors of the Company shall 
        terminate  prior to the attainment of the age for ineligibility for 
        reelection and prior to the completion of eight years of service as a 
        director for reasons other than death or disability, such Restricted 
        Stock Units shall terminate and all of the rights, title and interest 
        of the recipient thereunder shall be forfeited in their entirety.  
        Following the effective date of this Plan, each new director shall, 
        effective as of the date of such individual's initial election or 

                                      2

        appointment to the Board of Directors, be granted 2000  Restricted 
        Stock Units  which shall be subject to the same terms and restrictions 
        as are described in this paragraph (a). Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
        in no event shall Shares be issued pursuant to a Restricted Stock Unit 
        granted under this paragraph (a)  if a director's service on the board 
        shall terminate within less than six months after the date of grant for 
        any reason other than death or disability.

(b)     Grants of Restricted Stock Units for Portion of Annual Retainer. As of 
        the date of the annual meeting of stockholders each year following the 
        effective date of this Plan, fifty percent (50%) of the annual retainer 
        (not including retainers for committee membership or committee chair) 
        payable to each director during the twelve-month period beginning May 1 
        of such year and ending April 30 of the following year shall be paid to 
        the director in the form of Restricted Stock Units.  Also, fifty 
        percent (50%) of each director's annual retainer for the period 
        beginning May 1, 1995 and ending April 30, 1996 remaining payable after 
        June 30 shall be paid to the director in the form of Restricted Stock 
        Units, which shall be granted as of the effective date of this Plan.  
        The number of Restricted Stock Units to be granted under this paragraph 
        (b) in each case shall be determined by dividing (i) the amount of 
        annual retainer to be paid in the form of Restricted Stock Units by 
        (ii) the Fair Market Value of the Shares and shall be rounded up to the 
        next whole Restricted Stock Unit in the event such determination 
        results in a fraction of a Restricted Stock Unit.  Each such Restricted 
        Stock Unit shall provide for the issuance of one Share upon the 
        termination of the recipient's membership on the Board of Directors.  
        In the event a director's service on the Board shall terminate for any 
        reason during a year, the number of Restricted Stock Units granted for 
        such year shall be reduced proportionately, and the excess shall be 
        forfeited.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this paragraph (b) shall no 
        longer be applicable after April 15, 1998.

(c)     Right to Dividend Equivalents.  Each recipient of  Restricted Stock 
        Units under this Plan shall have the right, during the period when such 
        Restricted Stock Units are outstanding and prior to the termination, 
        forfeiture or payment or settlement thereof, to receive dividend 
        equivalents equal to the amount or value of any cash or other 
        distributions or dividends payable on the same number of Shares.  The 
        Company shall accumulate dividend equivalents on each dividend payment 
        date and pay such accumulated amounts without interest annually.

(d)     Issuance of Shares Upon Lapse of Restrictions.  A stock certificate or 
        certificates shall be registered and issued in the name of the holder 
        of Restricted Stock Units and delivered to such holder as soon as 
        practicable after such Restricted Stock Units have become payable or 
        settleable in accordance with the terms of the Plan.

(e)     Limits on Transfer of Restricted Stock Units.  No Restricted Stock 
        Units and no right under any Restricted Stock Units shall be 
        assignable, alienable, salable or transferable by a participant 
        otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  All 
        rights under any Restricted Stock Unit shall be exercisable during the 
        participant's lifetime only by the participant or, if permissible under 
        applicable law, by the participant's guardian or legal representative. 

                                      3

        No Restricted Stock Unit and no right under any such Restricted Stock 
        Unit may be pledged, alienated, attached, or otherwise encumbered, and 
        any purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof 
        shall be void and unenforceable against the Company.

(f)     Share Certificates.  All certificates for Shares delivered under the 
        Plan pursuant to any Restricted Stock Units shall be subject to such 
        stop transfer orders and other restrictions as the Secretary may deem 
        advisable under the Plan and the rules, regulations, and other 
        requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock 
        exchange upon which such Shares or other securities are then listed, 
        and any applicable Federal or state securities laws, and the Secretary 
        may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to 
        make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

Amendment and Termination

Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless expressly provided 
in this Plan:

(a)     Amendments to the Plan.  The Board of Directors of the Company may 
        amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan, without the 
        consent of any stockholder, participant, other holder or beneficiary of 
        Restricted Stock Units, or other person; provided, however, that, no 
        such action shall impair the rights under any Restricted Stock Units 
        theretofore granted under the Plan. 

(b)     Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistencies.  The Secretary 
        may correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any 
        inconsistency in the Plan or any Restricted Stock Units in the manner 
        and to the extent he or she shall deem desirable to carry the Plan into 
        effect.

General Provisions

(a)     Withholding.  The Company shall be authorized to withhold from any 
        Restricted Stock Units granted or any transfer made under any 
        Restricted Stock Units or under the Plan or from any dividend 
        equivalents to be paid on Restricted Stock Units the amount (in cash, 
        Shares, other securities, or other property) of any taxes required to 
        be withheld in respect of a grant, payment or settlement of Restricted 
        Stock Units or any payment of dividend equivalents under such 
        Restricted Stock Units or under the Plan and to take such other action 
        as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all 
        obligations for the payment of any such taxes.

(b)     No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.  Nothing contained in the 
        Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or continuing in effect 
        other or additional compensation arrangements, and such arrangements 
        may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific 
        cases.

(c)     No Right to Continued Board Membership.  The grant of Restricted Stock 
        Units shall not be construed as giving a participant the right to be 
        retained as a director of the Company.  The Board of Directors may at 

                                      4

        any time fail or refuse to nominate a participant  for election to the 
        Board, and the stockholders of the Company may at any election fail or 
        refuse to elect any participant to the Board free from any liability or 
        claim under this Plan or any Restricted Stock Units.

(d)     Governing Law.  The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and 
        any rules and regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in 
        accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and applicable 
        Federal law.

(e)     Severability.  If any provision of the Plan or any Restricted Stock 
        Unit is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or 
        unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or any 
        Restricted Stock Unit, or would disqualify the Plan or any Restricted 
        Stock Unit under any law deemed applicable by the Secretary, such 
        provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable 
        laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed amended without, in the 
        determination of the Secretary, materially altering the intent of the 
        Plan or the Restricted Stock Unit, such provision shall be stricken as 
        to such jurisdiction, person or Restricted Stock Unit, and the 
        remainder of the Plan and any such Restricted Stock Unit shall remain 
        in full force and effect.

(f)     No Trust or Fund Created.  Neither the Plan nor any Restricted Stock 
        Units shall create or be construed to create a trust or separate fund 
        of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and a 
        participant or any other person.  To the extent that any person 
        acquires a right to receive Restricted Stock Units, or Shares pursuant 
        to Restricted Stock Units, from the Company pursuant to this Plan, such 
        right shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general 
        creditor of the Company.

(g)     No Fractional Shares.  No fractional Shares shall be issued or 
        delivered pursuant to the Plan.

Effective Date of the Plan

The Plan shall be effective as of June 15, 1995.

Term of the Plan

No Restricted Stock Units shall be granted under the Plan after April 18, 2006. 
However, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in the restrictions 
applying to Restricted Stock Units previously issued, any Restricted Stock 
Units theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, and the authority of the 
Secretary to interpret, construe, administer and make determinations under this 
Plan, and the authority of the Board of Directors of the Company to amend the 
Plan, shall extend beyond such date.

such election shall for all purposes be deemed to have been established under 
this Plan.


                                       3

Section 8.  Form and Time of Distributions.

Distributions of amounts credited to each Director's Cash Account shall be

foregoing, an earlier distribution may be made, at the discretion of the 
Secretary, upon a finding that a Director is suffering a significant financial 
hardship caused by a recent event or events not within such Director's 
control; provided, however, that in such event, the cash or shares distributed 
shall be limited to those amounts necessary to accommodate the financial 
hardship, as determined by the Secretary.

Section 9.  Death of Director.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the death of a Director prior 
to receipt by such Director of the full amount of cash and number of shares to 
be distributed to the Director, all such cash and/or shares will be 
distributed to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the Director, or 
if no beneficiary has been designated, to the Director's estate as soon as 
practicable following the month in which the death occurred.

Section 10.  Accounts Unsecured.

Until distributed, all amounts credited to any Cash Accounts or represented by 
units credited to any Stock Unit Account shall be property of TI, available 
for TI's use, and subject to the claims of TI's general creditors.  The rights 
of any Director or beneficiary to distributions under this Plan are not 
subject to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, or 
encumbrance, and shall not be subject to the debts or liabilities of any 
Director or beneficiary.

Section 11.  Certain Rights Reserved by TI.

TI reserves the right to suspend, modify or terminate this Plan at any time, 
and, in such event, shall have the right to distribute to each Director all 
amounts in such Director's Cash Account or shares of TI common stock 
equivalent to units in such Director's Stock Unit Account, including, in the 
case of Stock Unit Accounts, the right to distribute cash equivalent to the 
units in such Accounts.

Section 12.  Certain Affiliations.

In the event that any Director terminates his or her membership on the Board 
and becomes affiliated with a government agency or with any private company or 
firm that the Board Organization and Nominating Committee believes to be in 
competition with TI, the Board may, at its discretion, require a distribution 
of all amounts in any Director's Cash Account or shares equivalent to units in 
such Director's Stock Unit Account.

Section 13.  Administration and Interpretation of Plan.

The Secretary shall have full power and authority to construe, interpret and 
administer this Plan.  The Secretary may issue rules and regulations for 
administration of the Plan.  All decisions of the Secretary shall be final, 
conclusive and binding upon all parties, including the Company, the 
stockholders and the directors.  In the event of the absence or inability to 
act of the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary shall have the authority to act 
in his place.

Subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law, the Secretary shall have 
full power and authority to:  (i) interpret and administer the Plan and any 
instrument or agreement relating thereto; (ii) establish, amend, suspend or 
waive such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the Secretary 
shall deem appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan; and 
(iii) make any other determination and take any other action that the 
Secretary deems necessary or desirable for the administration of this Plan.

                              TEXAS INSTRUMENTS
                 STOCK OPTION PLAN FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS
                          As Adopted April 16, 1998

The purpose of the Texas Instruments Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee 
Directors (the "Plan") is to increase the proprietary and vested interest of 
the non-employee directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated (the "Company") 
in the growth and performance of the Company by granting such directors 
options to purchase shares of the common stock of the Company, $1.00 par value 
("Shares").

Section 1.  Administration.

     The Plan shall be administered by the Secretary of the Company (the 
"Secretary").  Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Secretary shall have 
full power and authority to construe, interpret and administer the Plan.  The 
Secretary may issue rules and regulations for administration of the Plan.  All 
decisions of the Secretary shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all 
parties, including the Company, the stockholders and the directors.  In the 
event of the absence or inability of the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary 
shall have the authority to act in his place.

     Subject to the terms of the Plan and applicable law, the Secretary shall 
have full power and authority to: (i) interpret and administer the Plan and 
any instrument or agreement relating to, or options to purchase common stock 
of the Company granted under, the Plan; (ii) establish amend, suspend or waive 
such rules and regulations and appoint such agents as the Secretary shall deem 
appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan; and (iii) make any 
other determination and take any other action that the Secretary deems 
necessary or desirable for the administration of the Plan.

Section 2.  Eligibility.

     A member of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") who is 
not an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries shall be eligible for grant 
of options under the Plan ("Eligible Director").  Any holder of an option 
granted hereunder shall hereinafter be referred to as a "Participant."

Section 3.  Shares Subject to the Plan.

     The Shares deliverable upon the exercise of options will be made available
 from treasury Shares.  

Section 4.  Option Grants.

     Each individual who is an Eligible Director will be granted an option to 
purchase 5,000 Shares as of the date of each regular January meeting of the 
Compensation Committee of the Board or any successor committee (the 
"Compensation Committee") following the effective date of the Plan or, if no 
such January meeting is held, as of the date of the first meeting of the 
Compensation Committee during a calendar year.  The options granted will be 
nonstatutory stock options not intended to qualify under Section 422 of the 




                                       1
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and shall have the 
following terms and conditions:

          (a)     Price.  The Purchase price per share of Shares deliverable 
                  upon the exercise of each option shall be 100% of the Fair 
                  Market Value per share of the Shares on the date the option 
                  is granted.  For purposes of this Plan, Fair Market Value 
                  shall be determined to be equal to the simple average of the 
                  high and low prices of the Shares on the date of grant (or, 
                  if there is no trading on the New York Stock Exchange on 
                  such date, then on the first previous date on which there is 
                  such trading) as reported in "New York Stock Exchange 
                  Composite Transactions" in "The Wall Street Journal," 
                  rounded upward to the next whole cent if such Fair Market 
                  Value should include a fraction of a cent.

          (b)     Payment.  The Secretary shall determine the method or 
                  methods by which, and the form or forms, including, without 
                  limitation, cash, Shares, or other property, or any 
                  combination thereof, having a Fair Market Value on the 
                  exercise date equal to the relevant exercise price, in which 
                  payment of the exercise price with respect to an option may 
                  be made or deemed to have been made.

          (c)     Exercisability and Term of Options.  Subject to 
                  Section 4(d), options shall become exercisable in four equal 
                  annual installments commencing on the first anniversary date 
                  of the grant, provided the holder of such option remains an 
                  Eligible Director until such anniversary date, and shall be 
                  exercisable until ten years from the date of grant.

          (d)     Termination of Service as Eligible Director.  The effect of 
                  a Participant's termination of service as a director of the 
                  Company shall be as follows:

                       (i)  Termination for cause:  All outstanding options 
                       held by the Participant shall be canceled immediately 
                       upon termination.

                       (ii)  Death:  All outstanding options held by the 
                       Participant shall continue to full term, becoming 
                       exercisable in accordance with Section 4(c), and shall 
                       be exercisable by such Participant's heirs.

                       (iii)  Permanent disability:  All outstanding options 
                       held by the Participant shall continue to full term, 
                       becoming exercisable in accordance with Section 4(c).

                       (iv)  Termination after 8 years of service:  Any 
                       outstanding option held by the Participant for at least 
                       six months after the grant of such option shall 
                       continue to full term, becoming exercisable in 
                       accordance with Section 4(c).

                       (v)  Termination by reason of ineligibility to stand 
                       for reelection under the Company's by-laws:  Any 
                       outstanding option held by the Participant for at least 
                       six months after the grant of such option shall 
                       continue to full term, becoming exercisable in 
                       accordance with Section 4(c).


                                       2
                       (vi)  Other:  For any termination other than those 
                       specified above, all outstanding options held by the 
                       Participant shall be exercisable for 30 days after the 
                       date of termination, only to the extent that such 
                       options were exercisable on the date of termination, 
                       except as follows:

                            (A)  If the Participant dies within 30 days after 
                            his or her termination, then such Participant's 
                            heirs may exercise the options for a period of up 
                            to one year after the Participant's death, but 
                            only to the extent any unexercised portion was  
                            exercisable on the date of termination.

                            (B)  If the Participant's termination occurs 
                            within 30 days before the effective date of a 
                            Change in Control (as defined in Section 6), then 
                            the Change in Control will be deemed to have 
                            occurred first and the options shall be 
                            exercisable in accordance with Section 4(c).

          (e)     Non-transferability of Options.  No option shall be 
                  transferable by a Participant except by will or by the laws 
                  of descent and distribution, and during the Participant's 
                  lifetime may be exercised only by Participant or, if 
                  permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's legal 
                  guardian or representative.

          (f)     Option Agreement.  Each option granted hereunder shall be 
                  evidenced by an agreement with the Company which shall 
                  contain the terms and provisions set forth herein and shall 
                  otherwise be consistent with the provisions of the Plan.

Section 5.  Adjustment of and Changes in Shares.

     In the event that the Secretary shall determine that any dividend or 
other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or 
other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, 
reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, 
repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance 
of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the 
Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares 
such that an adjustment is determined by the Secretary to be appropriate in 
order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits 
intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Secretary shall, in 
such manner as he or she may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (a) the 
number and type of Shares subject to outstanding options, and (b) the exercise 
price with respect to any option or, if deemed appropriate, make provision for 
a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding option; provided, however, that 
no fractional Shares shall be issued or outstanding hereunder.  
Notwithstanding any such corporate transaction or event, no adjustment shall 
be made in the number of Shares subject to options to be granted to new 
directors who are elected after the occurrence of any such corporate 
transaction or event.

Section 6.  Change of Control.

     The provisions of Section 4(c) shall not apply and options outstanding 
under the Plan shall be exercisable in full if a Change in Control occurs.  
Change in Control means an event when (a) any Person, alone or together with 


                                       3
its Affiliates and Associates or otherwise, shall become an Acquiring Person 
otherwise than pursuant to a transaction or agreement approved by the Board of 
Directors of the Company prior to the time the Acquiring Person became such, 
or (b) a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company shall change within 
any 24-month period unless the election or the nomination for election by the 
Company's stockholders of each new director has been approved by a vote of at 
least a majority of the directors then still in office who were directors at 
the beginning of the period.  For the purposes hereof, the terms Person, 
Affiliates, Associates and Acquiring Person shall have the meanings given to 
such terms in the Rights Agreement dated as of June 17, 1988 between the 
Company and Harris Trust and Savings Bank, successor in interest to First 
Chicago Trust Company of New York, (formerly Morgan Shareholder Services Trust 
Company), as in effect on the date hereof; provided, however, that if the 
percentage employed in the definition of Acquiring Person is reduced hereafter 
from 20% in such Rights Agreement, then such reduction shall also be 
applicable for the purposes hereof.

Section 7.  No Rights of Stockholders.

     Neither a Participant nor a Participant's legal representative shall be, 
or have any of the rights and privileges of, a stockholder of the Company in 
respect of any shares purchasable upon the exercise of any option, in whole or 
in part, unless and until certificates for such shares shall have been issued.

Section 8.  Plan Amendments.

     The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan 
without the consent of any stockholder or Participant or other person: 
provided, however, that no such action shall impair the rights under any 
option theretofore granted under the Plan and that, notwithstanding any other 
provision of the Plan or any option agreement, no such amendment, alteration, 
suspension, discontinuation or termination shall be made that would permit 
options to be granted with a per Share exercise price of less than the Fair 
Market Value of a Share on the date of grant thereof.

Section 9.  Effective Date.

     The Plan shall become effective on April 16, 1998.  The Plan shall 
terminate April 16, 2003 unless the Plan is extended or terminated at an 
earlier date.

Section 10.  No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements.

     Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or 
continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such 
arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific 
cases.

Section 11.  Governing Law.

     The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any rules and 
regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the 
laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law.

Section 12.  Severability.

     If any provision of the Plan or any option is or becomes or is deemed to 
be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person 
or option, or would disqualify the Plan or any option under any law deemed 



                                       4
applicable by the Board, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended 
to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or deemed 
amended without, in the determination of the Board, materially altering the 
intent of the Plan or the option, such provision shall be stricken as to such 
jurisdiction, person or option, and the remainder of the Plan and any such 
option shall remain in full force and effect.

Section 13.  No Right to Continued Board Membership.

     The grant of options shall not be construed as giving a participant the 
right to be retained as a director of the Company.  The Board may at any time 
fail or refuse to nominate a participant for election to the Board, and the 
stockholders of the Company may at any election fail or refuse to elect any 
participant to the Board free from any liability or claim under this Plan or 
any options.

Section 14.  No Trust or Fund Created.

     Neither the Plan nor any options shall create or be construed to create a 
trust or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the 
Company and a participant or any other person.  To the extent that any person 
acquires a right to receive options, or Shares pursuant to options, from the 
Company pursuant to this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right 
of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.
