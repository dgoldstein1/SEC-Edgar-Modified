              TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
                      Notes to Financial Statements


Diluted earnings per common share are based on average common and dilutive 
potential common shares outstanding (400.1 and 399.9 million shares for the 
third quarters of 1998 and 1997, and 400.3 and 397.4 million shares for the 
nine months ended September 30, 1998 and 1997). 

On September 30, 1998, TI sold its memory business, including its DRAM 
manufacturing joint venture interests, to Micron Technology, Inc.  As a 
result, TI received 28,933,092 Micron common shares, $740 million in notes 
convertible into an additional 12 million Micron common shares, and a $210 
million subordinated note.  The market value of the seven year, 6.5% 
convertible and subordinated notes was approximately $836 million, with an 
average imputed interest rate of 8.7%.  The Micron shares and notes are 
included in investments on the balance sheet.  In addition to TI's memory 
assets, Micron received $550 million in cash from TI to facilitate the 
deployment of Micron's technology throughout the acquired business.  TI 
deferred a pre-tax gain of $127 million on the sale until the 
repayment of the TI-provided financing.  In connection with the sale, TI 
agreed to guarantee the payment obligations of one of its former joint 
ventures under a newly-syndicated $450 million principal amount credit 
facility.  At closing, the joint venture had borrowed $210 million under the 
facility.  As a result of the guarantee, TI was granted a security interest in 
the joint venture's assets.  In addition, the guarantee is partially offset by 
certain contingent funding obligations of the joint venture shareholders.

In the second quarter of 1998, the company sold its shares in the TI-Acer DRAM 
semiconductor manufacturing joint venture to Acer Corporation for $120 million 
in cash.  This sale resulted in a pretax gain of $83 million.

Also in the second quarter of 1998, the company announced that as a result of 
various business divestitures over the past several years, the pending sale of 
its memory business, and weakness in the current semiconductor market 
environment, it was implementing a worldwide restructuring program in order to 
more closely match the size and cost of its support functions with the 
company's overall size, and further combine manufacturing resources for more 
efficient operations.  The plan included the elimination of approximately 
3,500 jobs around the world over the next few months through voluntary 
programs, attrition, outsourcing and layoffs, as well as the closing of 
several facilities.  As a result, the company took a pretax charge of $233 
million in the second quarter, of which $126 million was included in 
marketing, general and administrative expense and $107 million in cost of 
revenues.  Of the $233 million charge, $161 million was for severance, $55 
million for asset writeoffs, and $17 million for vendor cancellation and lease 
charges.  Implementation of the restructuring program is on schedule.

A new accounting standard, SFAS No. 133, was issued in second quarter, 1998 
and is effective in 2000.  It requires that all derivatives be marked-to-
market on an ongoing basis.  This applies whether the derivatives are 
standalone instruments, such as forward currency exchange contracts and 
interest rate swaps or embedded derivatives, such as conversion options 
contained in convertible debt investments.  Along with the derivatives, the 
underlying hedged items are also to be marked-to-market on an ongoing basis.  
These market value adjustments are to be included either in the income 
statement or stockholders' equity, depending on the nature of the transaction. 
The company expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2000 on a 
cumulative basis.  The effect has not yet been determined.






                                                5

In the first quarter of 1998, the company's DRAM manufacturing joint venture 
with Hitachi, Ltd. was discontinued.  In this connection, TI incurred a first 
quarter pretax charge of $219 million, which is included in cost of revenues. 
Also in this quarter, research and development expense included a charge of 
$25 million for the value of acquired in-process research and development from 
two business acquisitions.

The company adopted SFAS No. 130 beginning in the first quarter of 1998.  This 
accounting standard requires disclosure of total nonowner changes in 
stockholders' equity, which is defined as net income plus direct adjustments 
to stockholders' equity such as equity and cash investment adjustments and 
pension liability adjustments.  On this basis, these nonowner changes in 
stockholders' equity, including net income, for the third quarters of 1998 and 
1997, totaled $131 million and $1,717 million.  For the nine months ended 
September 30, 1998, and 1997 they totaled $193 million and $2,080 million.

Accounting standard SOP 98-1 was issued in first quarter, 1998, and is 
effective in 1999.  It requires capitalization of the development costs of 
software to be used internally, e.g., for manufacturing or administrative 
processes.  The company, which currently expenses such amounts as incurred, 
expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 1999 for developmental 
costs incurred in that quarter and thereafter.  The effect is not expected to 
be material.

Results for the third quarter of 1997 reflect the sale of TI's defense 
business, which was closed with Raytheon Company on July 11 for $2.95 billion 
in cash.  The net gain from this sale, after income taxes of $876 million, was 
$1,473 million and was included in discontinued operations. 

Results for the second quarter of 1997 included a pretax operating charge of 
$44 million for the termination of joint-venture agreements in Thailand and a 
$66 million pretax gain from the sale of three TI businesses, principally 
software.

In the first quarter of 1997, the company sold its mobile computing business 
and terminated its digital imaging printing development program.  As a result, 
the company took a pretax operating charge of $56 million in the first 
quarter, of which $27 million was for severance for involuntary employment 
reductions worldwide.  These severance actions were essentially completed by 
the end of the quarter and affected approximately 1,045 employees.  The 
balance, $29 million, was for other costs associated with the business sale 
and program termination, including vendor cancellation and lease charges.

The statements of income, statements of cash flows and balance sheet at 
September 30, 1998, are not audited but reflect all adjustments which are of a 
normal recurring nature and are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a 
fair statement of the results of the periods shown.

ITEM 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

The Registrant (the "company" or "TI") announced financial results for 
the third quarter of 1998 that included diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 
$0.41, compared with $0.60 in the third quarter of 1997 and $0.35 in the 
second quarter of 1998.  EPS includes the effect of losses in the memory 
business, equivalent to $0.26 per share. 

While total company performance was affected by weakness in the memory 
business and the overall semiconductor market, TI's digital signal processor 
(DSP) business achieved 17 percent growth over the same period a year ago, 
outpacing DSP industry growth.  Orders were up 8 percent from the second 
quarter of 1998 for Semiconductor (which excludes the memory business).

FINANCIAL RESULTS

(Note: The sale of the memory business to Micron Technology, Inc., was 
completed on September 30, 1998.  In this report, TI total and semiconductor 
numbers are reported without memory in the Financial Results and Semiconductor 
sections.  Details on TI results with memory are reported in the tables and 
the Additional Financial Information section.)  

TI revenues for the third quarter were $1912 million, down 8 percent from the 
year-ago quarter, primarily due to the effects of continuing weakness in the 
world semiconductor market.  Revenues were down 4 percent from the second 
quarter of 1998 due mainly to the seasonal cycle in the Educational & 
Productivity Solutions (E&PS) business.  Operating margins were 18.7 percent, 
flat with the year-ago quarter.  Compared to the second quarter of 1998, 
excluding charges in that quarter, operating margins were down 1.5 percentage 
points, about equally due to lower revenues in application-specific integrated 
circuits (ASIC), and an increased accrual for profit sharing.
 
Income for the quarter was $267 million, up 3 percent from the $258 million in 
the third quarter of 1997.  Income was down 7 percent from the second quarter 
of 1998 excluding special charges, about equally due to lower revenues in ASIC 
and an increased accrual for profit sharing.
 
The profit-sharing accrual that was made for employees this quarter reflects 
the anticipated 1998 company performance without the memory business in the 
fourth quarter of 1998.  Although profit-sharing expenses are accrued 
quarterly, profit sharing is paid annually based on the company's full-year 
operating profit margin.  This year's profit-sharing expenses have been 
substantially reduced by the losses incurred by the memory business during the 
first three quarters of this year. 

Third quarter orders were $1835 million, down from $2092 million in the year-
ago quarter reflecting weakness in the world semiconductor market.  Orders 
were up from the second quarter of 1998 primarily due to slightly higher 
orders for semiconductor products, which offset lower orders for M&C and E&PS 
products.
 
TI remains on target in reducing costs through the previously announced 
restructuring plan.  Annualized cost savings for the company from reduced 
general and administrative expenses and operating costs are estimated to be 
$270 million.  The restructuring is expected to be substantially implemented 
by year end. 






                                                8

TI's pre-tax gain of $127 million from the sale of its memory business has 
been deferred until repayment by Micron of the TI-provided financing.

OUTLOOK

Despite continuing weakness in the world semiconductor market, TI expects 
generally stable performance from its ongoing semiconductor business in the 
fourth quarter of 1998. 

End-equipment markets for digital signal processing and analog continue to 
show a mixture of strength and weakness.  The wireless market continues to 
grow at record levels.  Based on customer input, TI has revised its 
expectations for the wireless market in 1998 to more than 140 million units of 
digital cellular phone shipments, compared to earlier estimates of 125 million 
units.  The general market weakness in modems and hard-disk drives continues. 
The mass market, which is largely served through distribution channels, 
continues to grow at a slower rate in 1998 than in 1997, reflecting overall 
semiconductor market and world economic conditions.

Visibility into 1999 market growth for TI's core businesses remains limited 
due to uncertain world economies, as well as the timing of recovery in the 
modem and hard-disk drive markets.  

TI remains positive about the long-term outlook for the digital signal 
processing and analog markets. The semiconductor industry today is 
increasingly driven by a surge in digital connectivity that can be seen 
primarily in the wireless and networking areas.  TI believes the resulting 
growth and development of new products and applications will fuel the need for 
DSPs, which are the underlying processors for electronic equipment that must 
function in real time.  

A number of new DSP markets are beginning to emerge, including digital 
cameras, satellite phones, smart antennas, voice over Internet Protocol, 
digital motor control and digital TV.  TI continues to invest in the 
development of new markets through its $100 million venture fund.  To date, 
the company has invested in 12 companies focused on next-generation 
applications of digital signal processors.

SEMICONDUCTOR

Semiconductor revenues were down 8 percent from the third quarter of 1997, 
primarily due to weakness in the hard-disk drive and modem markets.  Revenues 
were even with the second quarter of 1998. Operating margins were flat with 
the year-ago quarter, and down slightly from second quarter of 1998 due about 
equally to lower revenues in ASIC, and an increased accrual for profit 
sharing.  In the quarter, TI reached a 10-year semiconductor patent cross-
license agreement with United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) of Taiwan, 
and semiconductor revenues and operating margins include a one-time catch-up 
payment associated with this agreement.

Revenues in TI's digital signal processors increased 17 percent from the third 
quarter of 1997, primarily due to strength in wireless communications, and 
were even with the second quarter of 1998.  Revenues in the analog business 
declined about 11 percent from the year-ago quarter, almost all of which was 
due to weakness in the hard-disk drive market.  Analog revenues were about 
even with second quarter 1998 levels.

DSP and mixed-signal/analog now comprise 58 percent of TI's semiconductor 
revenues.




                                                9

The remaining semiconductor revenues come from a broad range of advanced 
products, including standard logic, ASIC, reduced-instruction set 
microprocessors, and microcontrollers.  The financial performance of these 
areas generally reflected the overall market weakness for semiconductors with 
revenues down substantially from the year-ago quarter.  Compared with the 
second quarter of 1998, revenues were down slightly. 

Semiconductor orders in the third quarter were down 13 percent from the year-
ago quarter, primarily due to continuing weakness in the modem and hard-disk 
drive markets.  Orders were up sequentially by about 8 percent, mainly due to 
growth in wireless chipsets.

MATERIALS & CONTROLS (M&C)

TI's M&C business had operating margins of 14.5 percent in the third quarter, 
up 2.3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter due to gains in their best 
cost producer strategy.  Operating margins were down slightly from last 
quarter.  Revenues were down 5 percent from the year-ago quarter, at $227 
million, and down 7 percent from the second quarter of 1998.  Results were 
affected by disruption of production at a major automotive customer. 

TIRIS(TM) products continue to gain acceptance and new market applications, 
particularly in automotive and retail segments.  In September, Frost & 
Sullivan awarded the TIRIS business its annual Market Engineering award, given 
each year for the company that has "exhibited world-class leadership in the 
radio frequency identification (RFID) industry."

EDUCATIONAL & PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS (E&PS)

Revenues for E&PS were down slightly from the third quarter of 1997 to $133 
million.  Operating margins were up more than six points from the year-ago 
quarter, reflecting improvements in costs. This business typically delivers 
peak financial performance in the second and third quarters, due primarily to 
the school-year cycle.
 
The new TI-89 graphing calculator began shipping in mid-August.  The product 
has been well received, with the majority of educational dealers selling out 
of their inventory soon after receiving initial shipments.  E&PS also made 
good progress in its long-term expansion strategy, with the signing of a 
memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Education in China.  Under 
this agreement, the Chinese government and TI will cooperate to promote the 
use of mathematics and science educational tools in China. 

DIGITAL IMAGING

Revenues for Digital Imaging were up from a year ago.  During the quarter, the 
business achieved several new design-ins in growth sectors of the market: 
ultraportable projectors, video wall, and large venue.  In September, Plus 
Corporation, a Japanese customer, launched the industry's first XGA resolution 
ultraportable projector.

DIVESTED ACTIVITIES 

Revenues for the memory business were down 52 percent from the year-ago 
quarter to $202 million, due to sharply lower DRAM prices.  Revenues were up 
moderately from the second quarter of 1998, primarily due to increased 
shipments.   Loss from operations in the quarter was $155 million, equivalent 
to $0.26 per share, versus a loss of $29 million in the year-ago quarter.  In 
the second quarter of 1998, the loss from operations was $222 million, 
equivalent to $0.36 per share.  The decrease from the second quarter was due 
primarily to increased shipments and slightly better pricing in the second 
half of the third quarter.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

(Note: TI total numbers in this section include the memory business.  
Semiconductor numbers exclude memory.)

TI revenues for the third quarter were $2113 million, down 15 percent from the 
year-ago quarter, primarily due to sharply lower prices for DRAMs.  Revenues 
were about flat with the second quarter of 1998.  

TI revenues for the first nine months of 1998 were $6467 million, compared 
with $7322 million in the first nine months of 1997.  Almost all of the 
decrease in revenues was due to lower DRAM prices. The decrease in 
semiconductor revenues for the first nine months of 1998 was primarily due to 
weakness in the hard-disk drive market.  The decrease in M&C was due primarily 
to Asian market conditions, and the increase in E&PS was due to increased 
demand for graphing calculators.

TI's third quarter 1998 operating margins were 9.6 percent, down from 14.3 
percent in the third quarter of 1997, primarily due to increased pricing 
pressures in DRAMs.  Operating margins were up 1.3 percentage points from the 
second quarter of 1998 due to decreased losses in memory, excluding special 
charges in the second quarter.  For the first nine months of 1998, excluding 
special items: TI operating margins were 9.4 percent, down 3.2 percentage 
points from the year-ago period primarily due to lower DRAM prices.  
Semiconductor operating margins were about flat. The improvement in M&C and 
E&PS resulted from product cost reductions. 

Including special items: TI operating margins for the first nine months of 
1998 were 2.0 percent, down 9.2 percentage points from the same period a year 
ago. 

TI's third quarter income was $164 million, down from $239 million in the 
third quarter of 1997, primarily due to increased loss in memory.  In the 
first nine months of 1998, excluding special items, income was $482 million, 
compared with $591 million in the year-ago time period, and diluted earnings 
per share were $1.20, compared with $1.49.  Including special items, income 
was $218 million, compared with $565 million in the first nine months of 1997, 
and diluted earnings per share were $0.55, compared with $1.42. 

TI third-quarter 1998 orders were $2020 million, down from $2449 million in 
the third quarter of 1997.  The majority of the change is attributed to lower 
memory orders, while the remainder is due to general market weakness across 
other semiconductor products.  

For the first nine months of 1998, TI's orders were $6091 million, compared 
with $7605 million from the same period a year ago.  About half of the decline 
was due to lower memory orders, with the remainder essentially due to general 
market weakness across other semiconductor products.  Semiconductor orders for 
the first nine months were down, due to lower demand from hard-disk drive and 
modem customers.  M&C orders were slightly down, primarily due to Asian market 
conditions, and E&PS orders were up as a result of increased graphing 
calculator volume. 

Results for the first quarter of 1998 include special charges of $244 million, 
primarily for discontinuing the DRAM manufacturing joint venture with Hitachi, 
Ltd.  Last year's first quarter results included a special charge of $56 
million, primarily related to severance actions and other costs associated 
with the sale of TI's mobile computing business.  Special items for the second 
quarter of 1998 included a charge of $233 million for worldwide restructuring 
of support functions and consolidation of manufacturing operations, and an $83 
million gain on the sale of TI's shares of the TI-Acer joint venture to Acer 



                                               11

Corporation.  Last year's second quarter included a special charge of $44 
million for the termination of joint-venture agreements in Thailand and a $66 
million gain on the sale of three businesses, primarily software.  There were 
no special items in the third quarters of 1998 and 1997.

The income tax rate for the first nine months of 1998 was 34 percent, which is 
the estimated rate for the full year.

During the first nine months of 1998, cash and cash equivalents plus short-
term investments decreased by $878 million to $2142 million.  The 
discontinuance of the joint venture with Hitachi and the acquisition of those 
operating assets required $281 million of cash in the first quarter.  In 
addition, $91 million of cash was used to purchase the remaining outstanding 
shares of Amati Communications Corporation's common stock in the first 
quarter.  Under the terms of the sale of TI's memory business to Micron 
Technology, TI provided $550 million of cash financing to Micron and received 
approximately 28.9 million shares of Micron common stock valued at $881 
million as of the closing date, $740 million of 6.5 percent convertible notes, 
and a $210 million 6.5 percent subordinated note.  As of the closing date, the 
market value of the convertible and subordinated notes was approximately $836 
million, with an average yield to maturity of 8.7 percent.  The Micron shares 
and notes are included in investments on the balance sheet.  Per the terms of 
the sale, TI expects to make an additional cash payment to Micron in the 
fourth quarter of about $130 million as a result of lower than expected levels 
of working capital within the memory business at closing.

Cash flow from operating activities net of additions to property, plant and 
equipment was a use of $71 million in the first nine months of 1998. 

Capital expenditures totaled $200 million in the third quarter versus $351 
million in the third quarter of 1997, and $898 million for the first nine 
months of 1998, compared to $914 million in the first nine months of 1997.  
Capital expenditures are projected to be about $1.1 billion for 1998.  
Depreciation for the third quarter of 1998 was $305 million compared to $287 
million in the same quarter a year ago, and $878 million for the first nine 
months of 1998 compared to $806 million for the same period a year ago.  
Depreciation for 1998 is projected to be at $1.1 billion.

During the first nine months of 1998, TI repurchased approximately 2.9 million 
shares of common stock as part of its previously stated intent to neutralize 
the potential dilutive effect of shares to be issued under employee stock 
options.  

At the end of the third quarter, the debt-to-total-capital ratio was .18, down 
slightly compared to the 1997 year-end value of .19.

YEAR 2000

Since 1995, TI has been actively engaged in addressing Year 
2000 (Y2K) issues.  These result from the use of two-digit, rather than 
four-digit, year dates in software, a practice which could cause 
date-sensitive systems to malfunction or fail because they may not 
recognize or process date information correctly.  

State of Readiness: To manage its Y2K program, TI has divided its 
efforts into four program areas: 
     o     Information Technology (computer hardware, software, and
           electronic data interchange (EDI) interfaces);
     o     Physical Plant (manufacturing equipment and facilities);
     o     Products (including product development); and 
     o     Extended Enterprise (suppliers and customers).



                                     12

For each of these program areas, TI is using a four-step approach: 
     o     Ownership (creating awareness, assigning tasks);
     o     Inventory (listing items to be assessed for Y2K readiness); 
     o     Assessment (prioritizing the inventoried items, assessing 
           their Y2K readiness, planning corrective actions, making 
           initial contingency plans); and 
     o     Corrective Action Deployment (implementing corrective 
           actions, verifying implementation, finalizing and executing 
           contingency plans).  

At September 30, 1998, the Ownership and Inventory steps were 
essentially complete for all program areas.  The target completion 
dates for priority items by remaining steps are as follows: 
Assessment -- December 1998; Corrective Action Deployment -- June 1999.

To date, TI has achieved approximately two-thirds of its Assessment 
goals for its four program areas.  The Assessment status for each 
program area is as follows:
     o     Information Technology: Substantially all of TI's business 
           strategic information systems (manufacturing, marketing, 
           financial, and human resources) have been assessed, 
           corrected and verified, and corrected systems have been 
           deployed.  Hardware assessment is in process and on schedule 
           for completion.  TI is assessing the readiness of its EDI 
           interfaces with major customers and suppliers and expects 
           timely completion.
     o     Physical Plant:  Manufacturing equipment assessment has been 
           substantially completed and corrective actions scheduled.  
           Facilities assessment is in process and is approximately 
           two-thirds completed. These efforts are expected to be 
           completed on schedule.
     o     Products:  TI continues to assess the readiness of its 
           current products and is providing product status information 
           on its company web site.  This effort includes semiconductor 
           devices sold within the past 5 years. Divested product lines 
           are not part of the assessment.  The assessment to date has 
           identified date-related issues with certain of TI's 
           semiconductor development tool products.  The company 
           believes these issues are unlikely to cause significant 
           problems for TI customers.  Product assessments are expected 
           to be completed on time.
     o     Extended Enterprise: In 1997, TI began contacting its 
           suppliers regarding their Y2K readiness. TI's Y2K supplier 
           program includes assessing the readiness of its suppliers 
           with a particular focus on those considered essential for 
           prevention of a material disruption of TI's business 
           operations.  The assessment is ongoing and on schedule.  TI 
           is also discussing Y2K status with selected strategic 
           customers.

Costs to Address Y2K Issues: TI's estimated aggregate costs for its 
Y2K activities from 1995 through 2000 are expected to range from 
$70 million to $90 million.  To date, TI has spent approximately 
$50 million. 

Risks of Y2K Issues and Contingency Plans: TI continues to assess the 
Year 2000 issues relating to its physical plant, products, suppliers 
and customers, as well as legal risks that may be associated with 
discontinued products and divested product lines.  TI's contingency 
planning process is intended to mitigate worst-case business 
disruptions.  The company is preparing contingency plans to address 


                                     13

worst-case issues such as delays in product delivery, which could 
potentially result from events such as supply chain disruptions. As 
noted above, the company expects its contingency plans to be complete 
by June 1999.

ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Information concerning market risk is contained on pages 19, 39 and 40 of the 
Registrant's 1997 annual report to stockholders and is incorporated by 
reference to such annual report.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  Legal Proceedings.

Beginning May 1, 1998, the Registrant filed lawsuits in United States District 
Courts in Texas and Virginia, and in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, 
France, Germany and Japan against Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. or 
related entities (collectively, "Hyundai") seeking injunctive relief for 
alleged infringement of over a dozen of the Registrant's patents relating to 
the manufacture and sale of semiconductor devices, including DRAMs.  Hyundai 
has responded by filing an action in United States District Court in New York 
based on a contract claim that its cross-license agreement with the Registrant 
has not yet expired, and by filing lawsuits in United States District Courts 
in Texas, Virginia and Delaware and a counterclaim in the Registrant's U.K. 
action, seeking injunctive relief against Registrant for alleged infringement 
of Hyundai's patents relating to the manufacture and sale of semiconductor 
devices, including DRAMs.  

On September 3, 1998, Hyundai's action filed in United States District Court 
in New York was dismissed with prejudice.  On September 24, 1998, a Judicial 
Panel for Multi-District Litigation denied Hyundai's motion for consolidation 
and transfer.  On October 9, 1998, the District Court for the Eastern District 
of Virginia transferred two lawsuits filed by Hyundai and one filed by the 
Registrant to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of 
Texas.

                         TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED

                         Pursuant to Section 151 of the
                         General Corporation Law of the
                               State of Delaware


               We, William A. Aylesworth, Senior Vice President, Treasurer 
and Chief Financial Officer, and O. Wayne Coon, Vice President and Assistant 
Secretary, of Texas Instruments Incorporated, a corporation organized and 
existing under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware 
("Delaware Law"), in accordance with the provisions thereof, DO HEREBY 
CERTIFY:

               That pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of 
directors by the Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, the Board 
of Directors on June 18, 1998, adopted the following resolution creating a 
series of Preferred Stock in the amount and having the designation, voting 
powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special 
rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof as follows:

               Section 1.  Designation and Number of Shares.  The shares of 
such series shall be designated as "Series B Participating Cumulative 
Preferred Stock" (the "Series B Preferred Stock"), and the number of shares 
constituting such series shall be 2,200,000.  Such number of shares of the 
Series B Preferred Stock may be increased or decreased by resolution of the 
Board of Directors; provided that no decrease shall reduce the number of 
shares of Series B Preferred Stock to a number less than the number of shares 
then outstanding plus the number of shares issuable upon exercise or 
conversion of outstanding rights, options or other securities issued by the 
Corporation.

               Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

                     (a)  The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock
               shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the
               Board of Directors out of funds legally available for the
               purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash on the third 
               Monday of February, May, August and November of each year 
               (each such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly 
               Dividend Payment Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly 
               Dividend Payment Date after the first issuance of any share or 
               fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock, in an amount 
               per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater 
               of (i) $1.00 and (ii) subject to the provision for adjustment 
               hereinafter set forth, 1000 times the aggregate per share 
               amount of all cash dividends or other distributions and 1000 
               times the aggregate per share amount of all non-cash dividends 
               or other distributions (other than (A) a dividend payable in 
               shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the 
               Corporation (the "Common Stock") or (B) a subdivision of the 
               outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or 
               otherwise)), declared on the Common Stock since the 
               immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, 
               with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, 
               since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share 
               of Series B Preferred Stock.  If the Corporation shall at any 
               time after June 18, 1998 (the "Rights Declaration Date") pay 
               any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock 
               or effect a subdivision or combination of the outstanding 
               shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into 
               a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in 
               each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Series
               B Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such 
               event under clause 2(a)(ii) of the preceding sentence shall be 
               adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the 
               numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock 
               outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator
               of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were 
               outstanding immediately prior to such event.

                     (b)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or 
               distribution on the Series B Preferred Stock as provided in 
               paragraph 2(a) above immediately after it declares a dividend 
               or distribution on the Common Stock (other than as described 
               in clauses 2(a)(ii)(A) and 2(a)(ii)(B) above); provided that 
               if no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the 
               Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend 
               Payment Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend 
               Payment Date (or, with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend 
               Payment Date, the period between the first issuance of any 
               share or fraction of a share of Series B Preferred Stock and 
               such first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date), a dividend of 
               $1.00 per share on the Series B Preferred Stock shall 
               nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend 
               Payment Date.

                     (c)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative 
               on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock from the 
               Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next preceding the date of 
               issue of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock, unless the 
               date of issue of such shares is on or before the record date 
               for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case 
               dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue and be 
               cumulative from the date of issue of such shares, or unless 
               the date of issue is a date after the record date for the 
               determination of holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock 
               entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and on or before such 
               Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends shall 
               begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly Dividend 
               Payment Date. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear 
               interest. Dividends paid on shares of Series B Preferred Stock 
               in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at 
               the time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated 
               pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at 
               the time outstanding. The Board of Directors may fix a record 
               date for the determination of holders of shares of Series B 
               Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or 
               distribution declared thereon, which record date shall not be 
               more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment 
               thereof.

               Section 3.  Voting Rights.  In addition to any other voting 
rights required by law, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock 
shall have the following voting rights:

                     (a)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter 
               set forth, each share of Series B Preferred Stock shall 
               entitle the holder thereof to 1000 votes on all matters 
               submitted to a vote of stockholders of the Corporation.  If 
               the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration 
               Date pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of 
               Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination of the 
               outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or 
               otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common 
               Stock, then in each such case the number of votes per share to 
               which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were 
               entitled immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by 
               multiplying such number by a fraction the numerator of which 
               is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding 
               immediately after such event and the denominator of which is 
               the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding 
               immediately prior to such event.

                     (b)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the 
               holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock and the holders 
               of shares of Common Stock shall vote together as a single 
               class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders of 
               the Corporation.

                     (c)  (i) If at any time dividends on any Series B 
               Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six 
               quarterly dividends thereon, the occurrence of such 
               contingency shall mark the beginning of a period (herein 
               called a "default period") which shall extend until such time 
               when all accrued and unpaid dividends for all previous 
               quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly 
               dividend period on all shares of Series B Preferred Stock then 
               outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for 
               payment.  During each default period, all holders of Preferred 
               Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock then entitled as 
               a class to elect directors, voting together as a single class, 
               irrespective of series, shall have the right to elect two 
               Directors.

                          (ii)  During any default period, such voting right 
                    of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may be 
                    exercised initially at a special meeting called pursuant 
                    to subparagraph 3(c)(iii) hereof or at any annual meeting 
                    of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of 
                    stockholders, provided that neither such voting right nor 
                    the right of the holders of any other series of Preferred 
                    Stock, if any, to increase, in certain cases, the 
                    authorized number of Directors shall be exercised unless 
                    the holders of 10% in number of shares of Preferred Stock 
                    outstanding shall be present in person or by proxy.  The 
                    absence of a quorum of holders of Common Stock shall not 
                    affect the exercise by holders of Preferred Stock of such 
                    voting right.  At any meeting at which holders of 
                    Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting right 
                    initially during an existing default period, they shall 
                    have the right, voting as a class, to elect Directors to 
                    fill such vacancies, if any, in the Board of Directors as 
                    may then exist up to two Directors or, if such right is 
                    exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two Directors.  
                    If the number which may be so elected at any special 
                    meeting does not amount to the required number, the size 
                    of the Board of Directors will be automatically increased 
                    without any action on the part of the holders of 
                    Preferred Stock as shall be necessary to permit the 
                    election by them of the required number.  After the 
                    holders of the Preferred Stock shall have exercised their 
                    right to elect Directors in any default period and during 
                    the continuance of such period, the number of Directors 
                    shall not be increased or decreased except by vote of the 
                    holders of Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant 
                    to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to 
                    or pari passu with the Series B  Preferred Stock.

                          (iii)  Unless the holders of Preferred Stock shall, 
                    during an existing default period, have previously 
                    exercised their right to elect Directors, the Board of 
                    Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders 
                    owning in the aggregate not less than 10% of the total 
                    number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding, 
                    irrespective of series, may request, the calling of 
                    special meeting of holders of Preferred Stock, which 
                    meeting shall thereupon be called by the President, a 
                    Vice President or the Secretary of the Corporation.  
                    Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which 
                    holders of Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant 
                    to this paragraph 3(c)(iii) shall be given to each holder 
                    of record of Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such 
                    notice to him at his last address as the same appears on 
                    the books of the Corporation.  Such meeting shall be 
                    called for a time not earlier than 20 days and not later 
                    than 60 days after such order or request or in default of 
                    the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such 
                    order or request, such meeting may be called on similar 
                    notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the 
                    aggregate not less than 10% of the total number of shares 
                    of Preferred Stock outstanding, irrespective of series.  
                    Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph 
                    3(c)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during 
                    the period within 60 days immediately preceding the date 
                    fixed for the next annual meeting of stockholders.


                          (iv)  In any default period, the holders of Common
                     Stock, and other classes of stock of the Corporation if
                     applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect the
                     whole number of Directors until the holders of Preferred
                     Stock shall have exercised their right to elect two
                     Directors voting as a class, after the exercise of which
                     right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders of
                     Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their
                     successors shall have been elected by such holders or 
                     until the expiration of the default period, and (y) any 
                     vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except as 
                     provided in paragraph 3(c)(ii) hereof) be filled by vote 
                     of a majority of the remaining Directors theretofore 
                     elected by the holders of the class of stock which 
                     elected the Director whose office shall have become 
                     vacant.  References in this paragraph 3(c) to Directors 
                     elected by the holders of a particular class of stock 
                     shall include Directors elected by such Directors to 
                     fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the 
                     foregoing sentence.

                          (v)  Immediately upon the expiration of a default
                     period, (x) the right of the holders of Preferred Stock 
                     as a class to elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term 
                     of any Directors elected by the holders of Preferred 
                     Stock as a class shall terminate, and (z) the number of 
                     Directors shall be such number as may be provided for in 
                     the certificate of incorporation or bylaws irrespective 
                     of any increase made pursuant to the provisions of 
                     paragraph 3(c)(ii) hereof (such number being subject, 
                     however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by 
                     law or in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws).  
                     Any vacancies in the Board of Directors effected by the 
                     provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding 
                     sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining 
                     Directors.

                     (d)  The Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation
               shall not be amended in any manner (whether by merger or
               otherwise) so as to adversely affect the powers, preferences 
               or special rights of the Series B Preferred Stock without the 
               affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the

               separately as a class.

                     (e)  Except as otherwise provided herein, holders of

               and their consent shall not be required for taking any 
               corporate action.

               Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

                     (a)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or
               distributions payable on the Series B Preferred Stock as 
               provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all 
               accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not 
               declared, on outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock 
               shall have been paid in full, the Corporation shall not:

                          (i)  declare or pay dividends on, or make any other
                     distributions on, any shares of stock ranking junior
                     (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution 
                     or winding up) to the Series B Preferred Stock;

                          (ii)  declare or pay dividends on, or make any 
                     other distributions on, any shares of stock ranking on a 
                     parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, 
                     dissolution or winding up) with the Series B Preferred 
                     Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Series B 
                     Preferred Stock and all such other parity stock on which 
                     dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the 
                     total amounts to which the holders of all such shares 
                     are then entitled;

                          (iii)  redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for
                     value any shares of stock ranking junior (either as to 
                     dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding 
                     up) to the Series B Preferred Stock; provided that the 
                     Corporation may at any time redeem, purchase or 
                     otherwise acquire shares of any such junior stock in 
                     exchange for shares of stock of the Corporation ranking 
                     junior (as to dividends and upon dissolution, 
                     liquidation or winding up) to the Series B Preferred 
                     Stock; or

                          (iv)  redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for 
                     value any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, or any 
                     shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to 
                     dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding 
                     up) with the Series B Preferred Stock, except in 
                     accordance with a purchase offer made in writing or by 
                     publication (as determined by the Board of Directors) to 
                     all holders of Series B Preferred Stock and all such 
                     other parity stock upon such terms as the Board of 
                     Directors, after consideration of the respective annual 
                     dividend rates and other relative rights and preferences 
                     of the respective series and classes, shall determine in 
                     good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment 
                     among the respective series or classes.

                     (b)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of 
               the Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for value any 
               shares of stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation 
               could, under paragraph 4(a), purchase or otherwise acquire 
               such shares at such time and in such manner.

               Section 5.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Series B 
Preferred Stock redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation 
in any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the 
acquisition thereof.  All such shares shall upon their cancellation become 
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock without designation as to 
series and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to be 
created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors as permitted 
by the Certificate of Incorporation or as otherwise permitted under Delaware 
Law.

               Section 6.  Liquidation, Dissolution and Winding Up.  Upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, no distribution
shall be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as
to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Series B
Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of Series B
Preferred Stock shall have received $1.00 per share, plus an amount equal to
accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not
declared, to the date of such payment; provided that the holders of shares of
Series B Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an aggregate amount per
share, subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal 
to 1000 times the aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of
Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of stock ranking on a parity (either as 
to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Series 
B Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series B 
Preferred Stock and all such other parity stock in proportion to the total 
amounts to which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such 
liquidation, dissolution or winding up.  If the Corporation shall at any time 
after the Rights Declaration Date pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in 
shares of Common Stock or effect a subdivision or combination of the 
outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise) into a 
greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case 
the aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock 
were entitled immediately prior to such event under the proviso in clause (1) 
of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a 
fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock 
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the 
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to 
such event.

               Section 7.  Consolidation, Merger, Etc.  If the Corporation
shall enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction 
in which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other 
stock or securities, cash or any other property, then in any such case the 
shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly 
exchanged for or changed into an amount per share, subject to the provision 
for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 1000 times the aggregate 
amount of stock, securities, cash or any other property, as the case may be, 
into which or for which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  
If the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date pay 
any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or effect a 
subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by 
reclassification or otherwise) into a greater or lesser number of shares of 
Common Stock, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding 
sentence with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Series B 
Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction 
the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding 
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of 
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

               Section 8.  No Redemption.  The Series B Preferred Stock shall
not be redeemable.

               Section 9.  Rank.  The Series B Preferred Stock shall rank
junior (as to dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up) to
all other series of the Corporation's preferred stock except any series that
specifically provides that such series shall rank junior to the Series B
Preferred Stock.

               Section 10.  Fractional Shares.  Series B Preferred Stock may 
be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in 
proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights, 
receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of 
all other rights of holders of Series B Preferred Stock.
