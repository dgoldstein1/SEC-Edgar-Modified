                          Notes to Financial Statements


1. Diluted earnings per common share are based on average common and dilutive
potential common shares outstanding (1,708.3 and 1,658.7 million shares for the
second quarters of 2000 and 1999, and 1,705.8 and 1,654.6 million shares for the
six months ended June 30, 2000 and 1999). Share amounts have been retroactively
adjusted for the 2000 two-for-one stock split which was effective May 22, 2000.

2. On June 21, 2000, TI entered into an agreement to purchase Burr-Brown
Corporation for approximately 88 million shares of TI common stock in a
stock-for-stock transaction, including options and convertible notes.

On June 23, 2000, TI entered into an agreement to purchase Alantro
Communications, Inc., in a stock-for-stock transaction with an aggregate value
as of that date, including stock options and warrants, of approximately $300
million.

On June 29, 2000, TI entered into an agreement to purchase Dot Wireless, Inc.,
in a stock-for-stock transaction with an aggregate value as of that date,
including stock options, of approximately $475 million.

3. In the second quarter of 2000, the company realized a pretax investment gain
of $1211 million, included in other income, from the sale of 20 million shares
of Micron Technology, Inc. common stock which were part of the consideration
received in the company's 1998 divestiture of its memory business to Micron.

4. In the first quarter of 2000, the company recorded pretax charges of $29
million, associated with actions including the closing of the Materials and
Controls manufacturing facility in Versailles, Kentucky, and TI's acquisition
of Toccata Technology ApS. Of the $29 million charge, $12 million was for
severance for the elimination of 480 jobs in Kentucky. As of June 30, 2000,
none of the severance costs had been paid. Of the $29 million charge, $20
million is included in cost of revenues, $6 million in marketing, general and
administrative expense, and $3 million in research and development expense.

5. In the first quarter of 1999, the company announced a consolidation of
semiconductor manufacturing operations in Japan to improve manufacturing
efficiencies and reduce costs. The action resulted in a pretax charge of $14
million in the first quarter, of which $13 million was for severance for the
elimination of 153 jobs in Hatagoya, Japan and $1 million for other related
costs. At year-end 1999, this program was complete. Of the $14 million charge,
$11 million was included in cost of revenues and $3 million in marketing,
general and administrative expense.

6. Total comprehensive income, i.e., net income plus investment and pension
liability adjustments to stockholders' equity, for the second quarters of 2000
and 1999 was $1,394 million and $154 million. For the six months ended June 30,
2000 and 1999, it was $3,245 million and $421 million.

7. There has been no significant change in the status of the audit and
investigation concerning grants from the Italian government.

8. In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101 on revenue recognition. TI is currently
evaluating the impact of SAB No. 101, which is effective in the fourth quarter
of 2000, and expects any effect to be immaterial.

June 30, 2000, are not audited but reflect all adjustments which are of a
normal recurring nature and are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a
fair statement of the results of the periods shown.

Beginning in 2000, management decided to assess profit performance of its
business segments excluding the effect of acquisition-related amortization.
Accordingly, 2000 business segment profit amounts exclude this amortization ($25
million for the second quarter and $50 million year-to-date). Business segment
profit amounts for 1999 include the amortization ($9 million for the second
quarter and $19 million year-to-date).

11. Acquisition-related purchased in-process R&D charges were $79 million in
1999. These charges are for the value of acquired in-process research and
development from business purchase acquisitions. Values for acquired in-process
R&D (purchased R&D) were determined at the acquisition date based upon the
appraised value of the related developmental projects. Purchased R&D projects
were assessed, analyzed and valued within the context and framework articulated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission herein described as the Exclusion
Approach.

Significant assumptions, detailed in the following table, used in determining
the value of purchased R&D included the discount rate, the estimated beginning
date of projected operating cash flows, and the remaining cost and time, in
engineer-months, to complete the R&D projects. The term "engineer-month" refers
to the average amount of research work expected to be performed by an engineer
in a month.

The relative stage of completion and projected operating cash flows of the
underlying in-process projects acquired were the most significant and uncertain
assumptions utilized in the valuation analysis of the in-process R&D. Such
uncertainties could give rise to unforeseen budget overruns and/or revenue
shortfalls in the event that TI is unable to successfully complete and
commercialize the projects. TI management is primarily responsible for
estimating the value of the purchased R&D in all acquisitions accounted for
under the purchase method. TI expects to essentially meet its original return
expectations for the projects.

ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

The Registrant (the "company" or "TI") announced second-quarter 2000 financial
results that show strength across a wide breadth of its products and markets. TI
expects accelerating growth in its semiconductor business in the third quarter
and is raising its capital expenditures to support strong customer demand.

Note: The earnings per share (EPS) amounts in this report reflect the May 22,
2000, two-for-one stock split.

In the second quarter, TI's revenue increased 7 percent sequentially and 19
percent over the year-ago period. Semiconductor revenue increased 22 percent
compared with a year ago and 6 percent sequentially, despite the absence of an
$85 million catch-up royalty from Hyundai Electronics Industries, Co. included
in the year-ago quarter. Excluding the one-time royalties, TI revenue grew 23
percent and semiconductor revenue grew 28 percent compared with a year ago.

During the quarter, TI also began to realize gains from the 1998 divestiture of
its memory business to Micron Technology, Inc. As part of that transaction, TI
received approximately 58 million shares of Micron common stock and
interest-bearing notes that are convertible into an additional 25 million
shares. During the quarter, TI sold 20 million shares of the common stock,
realizing pre-tax gains of $1211 million or $0.45 EPS.

SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS

For the second quarter of 2000, TI reported the following:

     Total revenue was $2843 million, up 19 percent from $2395 million in the
     year-ago quarter and up 7 percent sequentially, primarily due to increased
     strength in semiconductor.

     Semiconductor revenue was $2414 million, up 22 percent from $1975 million
     in the same quarter of 1999 and up 6 percent sequentially.

     Cost of revenues in the second quarter was $1448 million compared to $1222
     million in the year-ago quarter. Cost of revenues increased about the same
     as the increase in revenues, on a percentage basis, reflecting
     manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher product shipments which
     offset the effect of the absence of the one-time Hyundai royalty.

     Research and development (R&D) totaled $372 million, compared with $365
     million in the second quarter of 1999, which included $52 million of
     in-process R&D costs from the Libit Signal Processing Ltd. acquisition. The
     increase was primarily due to semiconductor, including increased strategic
     investment for DSP and analog.

     Marketing, general and administrative expense in the quarter was $400
     million, compared with $345 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily due
     to higher semiconductor expenditures, including marketing-related
     activities. The increase was less than the increase in revenues, on a
     percentage basis.

     Other income (expense) net increased from $67 million in the second quarter
     of 1999 to $1341 million in the second quarter of 2000, primarily due to
     the sale of 20 million shares of Micron common stock.


                                       9
<PAGE>

     The income tax rate for the quarter was 34 percent.

     TI orders in the second quarter were $3217 million, up 26 percent from
     $2559 million in the year-ago quarter and up 12 percent from the first
     quarter due to semiconductor. Semiconductor orders increased 32 percent
     compared with the year-ago quarter and 13 percent sequentially.

     In addition to the $1211 million gain associated with the sale of Micron
     common stock, results for this quarter include $25 million of amortization
     of goodwill and other acquisition-related intangibles.

     For the second quarter of 1999, results include special charges of $52
     million for in-process R&D associated with the acquisition of Libit Signal
     Processing Ltd. Also included is amortization of goodwill and other
     acquisition-related intangibles of $9 million.

     For the first quarter of 2000, results include special charges of $29
     million for actions including the closing of a Materials and Controls (M&C)
     manufacturing facility in Versailles, Kentucky, and TI's acquisition of
     Toccata Technology ApS. Also included is amortization of goodwill and other
     acquisition-related intangibles of $25 million.

     Additional information relating to these items appears below under the
     heading "Special Charges and Gains."

OUTLOOK

Despite seasonal pressure, the company expects sequential revenue growth in its
semiconductor business to accelerate in the third quarter, based on broad
customer demand and strength in key markets such as wireless, catalog and
broadband communications. Revenue growth in wireless is expected to continue,
reflecting strong demand for the company's products. The mass market for TI's
catalog DSP and analog products is expected to continue to grow rapidly as a
result of new applications, new product introductions and increased demand for
existing catalog products. TI's broadband communications revenue should reflect
developing demand for TI's digital subscriber line (DSL) and cable modem
products. After four quarters of decline, TI's hard-disk drive revenue is
expected to resume sequential growth in the third quarter.

In its Educational and Productivity Solutions (E&PS) business, TI expects a
strong third quarter as the revenue pattern in this business becomes
increasingly aligned with back-to-school retail sales in this quarter.

In its M&C business, TI expects revenue to decline in the third quarter
reflecting seasonality in its control and automotive markets.

TI continues to expect its operating margin to reach 25 percent in the fourth
quarter of this year, before the effect of special charges and amortization of
acquisition-related intangibles.

In response to ongoing strength in demand for its products and increased
visibility into year 2001, TI is raising its capital expenditure forecast to
$2.8 billion for 2000, up from the previous forecast of $2.5 billion. This
increase supports additional capacity in TI's conversion of its analog
manufacturing to more efficient 200-millimeter wafers.

Depreciation for the year is expected to be $1.3 billion. R&D for 2000 is
expected to be $1.5 billion, primarily for DSP and analog, excluding
acquisition-related in-process R&D costs and amortization.

SEMICONDUCTOR

Semiconductor revenue in the second quarter was $2414 million, up 22 percent
from the same period in 1999, primarily due to strength in DSP and analog.
Semiconductor revenue increased 6 percent sequentially, primarily due to
strength in analog combined with growth across a breadth of TI's
semiconductor products.

Semiconductor operating profit for the second quarter was $606 million, or
25.1 percent of revenue, up from the same quarter a year ago as profit from
higher product shipments more than offset the absence of the Hyundai one-time
royalty.  Sequentially, operating margin was about the same as last quarter's
25.4 percent.

DSP revenue in the second quarter was up 40 percent from the same quarter a
year ago and up 3 percent sequentially.  Analog revenue was up 23 percent
compared with the year-ago period and up 8 percent sequentially.

                                       10
<PAGE>

Growth in TI's end-equipment operations was as follows:

- -    Wireless revenue increased 42 percent versus a year ago and 3 percent
     sequentially;

- -    Mass market revenue from TI's catalog products grew 53 percent versus
     a year ago and 15 percent sequentially;

- -    Hard-disk drive revenue declined 40 percent versus a year ago and 16
     percent sequentially, significantly constraining growth in both DSP and
     analog; and

- -    Growth in broadband communications continued to accelerate, with revenue
     growing 67 percent sequentially.

In the mass market, DSP catalog products grew 70 percent compared with a year
ago and 12 percent sequentially.  Analog catalog products increased 36
percent versus a year ago and 17 percent sequentially.  TI remains on track
to introduce more than 280 new catalog analog products and win at least 50
percent more catalog DSP customer designs in 2000.

Revenue for TI's remaining semiconductor products increased from the year-ago
quarter and from the first quarter of 2000.  Royalties declined from the
year-ago period when TI received an $85 million catch-up royalty from
Hyundai, and increased sequentially.

Semiconductor orders increased 32 percent from the year-ago quarter,
primarily due to strength in DSP and analog and 13 percent sequentially,
driven primarily by analog products along with a breadth of other
semiconductor products.

During the quarter, TI announced the acquisitions of three companies as part
of its strategy to continue extending its world leadership in DSP and analog:
Burr-Brown Corporation; Dot Wireless, Inc.; and Alantro Communications, Inc.

Burr-Brown is a leading supplier of high-performance catalog analog products,
principally data converters and amplifiers.  The acquisition extends TI's
position into new high-performance analog products and increases TI's ability
to offer its DSP customers essentially all of the analog components that
attach to a DSP.

Dot Wireless is a technology leader in CDMA, with products and technology for
the emerging IS-2000 third-generation (3G) cellular standard, including
1XRTT, which complements TI's own developments for the W-CDMA version of the
3G standard.  With this acquisition, TI will have strong product positions
across the full spectrum of 3G standards.

Alantro Communications specializes in wireless local area networking
technology using the IEEE 802.11 standard.  TI believes that wireless
networking will be the leading method of distributing broadband information,
including video, data and voice in the home or office, and will grow quickly
as broadband access deploys throughout the world.

MATERIALS AND CONTROLS (M&C)

M&C revenue in the second quarter was $296 million, up 15 percent from $256
million in the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to growth in automotive
sensor products.  Sequentially, second-quarter revenue was up 2 percent from
the first quarter.

Operating profit in the second quarter was $58 million, or 19.6 percent of
revenue, up 3.0 percentage points from the second quarter of 1999, primarily
due to increased revenue.  Operating profit was about even with the first
quarter of 2000.

During the quarter, M&C announced it would close its Dresden, Germany
facility, included in the Integrated Sensor Solutions acquisition last year,
to improve manufacturing efficiencies.

EDUCATIONAL AND PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS (E&PS)

Revenue for E&PS in the second quarter of 2000 was $134 million, down 12
percent from the year-ago quarter as revenue increasingly shifts with the
third quarter back-to-school season when compared with historical patterns.
Sequentially, revenue increased 54 percent, due to seasonality as retailers
and educational distributors began to stock for the third-quarter
back-to-school season.  Operating margin for the quarter was 28.6 percent,
up 0.5 percentage points from the year-ago period.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

For the first six months of 2000, TI revenue was $5497 million, up from the
$4477 million in the first six months of 1999, due to semiconductor. The
increase in semiconductor revenue for the first six months of 2000 was primarily
due to strength in DSP and analog. The increase in M&C was due primarily to
growth in automotive sensor products, and the decrease in E&PS was due primarily
to the increasing shift of revenue to the third quarter back-to-school season
compared with historical patterns.

Cost of revenues for the first six months of 2000 was $2818 million compared
with $2355 million in the year-ago period. Cost of revenues increased less than
the increase in revenues, on a percentage basis, reflecting manufacturing
efficiencies associated with higher product shipments.

R&D in the first six months of 2000 totaled $745 million, compared to $676
million in the first six months of 1999, including in-process R&D costs from
acquisitions. The increase was primarily due to semiconductor, including
increased strategic investment for DSP and analog.

Marketing, general and administrative expense in the first six months of 2000
was $789 million, compared with $676 million in the year-ago period, primarily
due to higher semiconductor expenditures, including marketing-related
activities. The increase was less than the increase in revenues, on a percentage
basis.

Other income (expense) net increased from $156 million in the first six months
of 1999 to $1466 million in the first six months of 2000, primarily due to the
sale of 20 million shares of Micron common stock.

The income tax rate for the first six months of 2000 was 34 percent.

For the first six months of 2000, TI orders were $6094 million, compared with
$4841 million from the same period a year ago, primarily due to increased
customer demand for semiconductor products. Semiconductor orders for the first
six months were up, primarily due to strength in DSP and analog. M&C orders were
up, primarily due to strength in its automotive and control markets. E&PS orders
were down, primarily due to the increasing shift of revenue to the third quarter
back-to-school season compared with historical patterns.

In the first six months of 2000, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term
investments increased by $1436 million to $4098 million, primarily due to the
sale of Micron common stock.

Cash flow from operating activities was $1042 million in the first half of 2000.
Capital expenditures totaled $1194 million in the first six months of 2000,
compared with $517 million in the first half of 1999. Capital expenditures
totaled $553 million in the second quarter of 2000 versus $311 million in the
year-ago quarter.

Depreciation for the first half of 2000 was $540 million, compared with $469
million in the same period a year ago. Depreciation for the second quarter of
2000 was $283 million, versus $240 million in the year-ago quarter.

At the end of the second quarter, the debt-to-total-capital ratio was .10 versus
 .13 at the end of 1999.

SPECIAL CHARGES AND GAINS

Second Quarter of 2000

In the second quarter of 2000, a special investment gain of $1211 million was
realized from the sale of 20 million shares of Micron common stock, which were
part of the consideration received in TI's 1998 divestiture of the memory
business to Micron. This $1211 million gain was included in other income.

First Quarter of 2000

In the first quarter of 2000, pretax charges of $29 million were taken,
associated with actions including the closing of the M&C manufacturing facility
in Versailles, Kentucky, and TI's acquisition of Toccata Technology ApS. Of the
$29 million charge, $12 million was for severance for the elimination of 480
jobs in Kentucky by the first quarter of 2001. At June 30, 2000, the pay-out of
the severance cost obligation had not yet begun. Of the $29 million, $20 million
is included in cost of revenues, $6 million in marketing, general and
administrative expense and $3 million in research and development expense. The
primary benefit from the Kentucky action is reduced personnel costs, which are
estimated to reach $10 million annually. The benefit is expected to begin in the
third quarter of 2000.

First Quarter of 1999

In the first quarter of 1999, the company announced a consolidation of
semiconductor manufacturing operations in Japan to improve manufacturing
efficiencies and reduce costs. This action resulted in a pretax charge of $14
million in the first quarter, of which $13 million was for severance for the
elimination of 153 jobs in Hatogaya, Japan. At year-end 1999, this program was
complete. Of the $14 million charge, $11 million was included in cost of
revenues and $3 million in marketing, general and administrative expense. The
primary benefit from this consolidation action was reduced personnel costs,
which were estimated to reach $11 million annually. The benefit began in the
fourth quarter of 1999.
