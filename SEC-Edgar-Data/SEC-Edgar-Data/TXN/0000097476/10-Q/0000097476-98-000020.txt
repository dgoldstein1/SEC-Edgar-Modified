              TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
                      Notes to Financial Statements

Diluted earnings per common share are based on average common and dilutive 
potential common shares outstanding (401.9 and 396.9 million shares for the 
second quarters of 1998 and 1997, and 400.8 and 395.7 million shares for the 
six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1997). 

In the second quarter of 1998, the company sold its shares in the TI-Acer DRAM 
semiconductor manufacturing joint venture to Acer Corporation for $120 million 
in cash.  This sale resulted in a pretax gain of $83 million.

On June 18, 1998, the company announced a definitive agreement with Micron 
Technology, Inc. for Micron to purchase substantially all of the assets of 
TI's semiconductor memory business, including TI's shares in its two remaining 
DRAM manufacturing joint ventures.  Under the agreement, TI will receive 
28,933,092 shares of Micron common stock and assumption by Micron of 
approximately $190 million of debt.  In addition, TI will provide $750 million 
in financing to Micron and receive $740 million principal amount of seven-
year, 6.5% notes convertible into 12 million Micron common shares, and a $210 
million principal amount, seven year, 6.5% subordinated note.  The market 
value of these notes is expected to be substantially less than their face 
amount.  The transaction is subject to several contingencies.  It is expected 
to close in the second half of this year.  In connection with the sale, TI 
could recognize a material loss when the transaction closes, depending on the 
price of Micron common stock at that time.

Also on June 18, 1998, the company announced that as a result of various 
business divestitures over the past several years, the pending sale of its 
memory business, and weakness in the current semiconductor market environment, 
it was implementing a worldwide restructuring program in order to more closely 
match the size and cost of its support functions with the company's overall 
size, and further combine manufacturing resources for more efficient 
operations.  The plan includes the elimination of approximately 3,500 jobs 
around the world over the next few months through voluntary programs, 
attrition, outsourcing and layoffs, as well as the closing of several 
facilities.  As a result, the company took a pretax charge of $233 million in 
the second quarter, of which $126 million was included in marketing, general 
and administrative expense and $107 million in cost of revenues.  Of the $233 
million charge, $161 million was for severance, $55 million for asset 
writeoffs, and $17 million for vendor cancellation and lease charges.

A new accounting standard, SFAS No. 133, was issued in second quarter, 1998 
and is effective in 2000.  It requires that all derivatives be marked-to-
market on an ongoing basis.  This applies whether the derivatives are 
standalone instruments, such as forward currency exchange contracts and 
interest note swaps or embedded derivatives, such as conversion options 
contained in convertible debt investments.  Along with the derivatives, the 
underlying hedged items are also to be marked-to-market on an ongoing basis.  
These market value adjustments are to be included either in the income 
statement or stockholders' equity, depending on the nature of the transaction. 
The company expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2000 on a 
cumulative basis.  The effect has not yet been determined.

In the first quarter of 1998, the company's DRAM manufacturing joint venture 
with Hitachi, Ltd. was discontinued.  In this connection, TI incurred a first 
quarter pretax charge of $219 million, which is included in cost of revenues. 
Also in this quarter, research and development expense included a charge of 
$25 million for the value of acquired in-process research and development from 
two business acquisitions. 

                                       4

The company adopted SFAS No. 130 beginning in the first quarter of 1998.  This 
accounting standard requires disclosure of total nonowner changes in 
stockholders' equity, which is defined as net income plus direct adjustments 
to stockholders' equity such as equity and cash investment adjustments and 
pension liability adjustments.  On this basis, these nonowner changes in 
stockholders' equity, including net income, for the second quarters of 1998 
and 1997, totaled $58 million and $235 million.  For the six months ended 
June 30, 1998, and 1997 they totaled $62 million and $363 million.

Accounting standard SOP 98-1 was issued in first quarter, 1998, and is 
effective in 1999.  It requires capitalization of the development costs of 
software to be used internally, e.g., for manufacturing or administrative 
processes.  The company, which currently expenses such amounts as incurred, 
expects to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 1999 for developmental 
costs incurred in that quarter and thereafter.  The effect is not expected to 
be material.

Results for the second quarter of 1997 included a pretax operating charge of 
$44 million for the termination of joint-venture agreements in Thailand and a 
$66 million pretax gain from the sale of three TI businesses, principally 
software.

In the first quarter of 1997, the company sold its mobile computing business 
and terminated its digital imaging printing development program.  As a result, 
the company took a pretax operating charge of $56 million in the first 
quarter, of which $27 million was for severance for involuntary employment 
reductions worldwide.  These severance actions were essentially completed by 
the end of the quarter and affected approximately 1,045 employees.  The 
balance, $29 million, was for other costs associated with the business sale 
and program termination, including vendor cancellation and lease charges.

The statements of income, statements of cash flows and balance sheet at June 
30, 1998, are not audited but reflect all adjustments which are of a normal 
recurring nature and are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair 
statement of the results of the periods shown.

ITEM 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.

The Registrant (the "company" or "TI") announced its second quarter 1998 
financial results.  Excluding special items and the memory business, which is 
being sold to Micron Technology, TI's gross profit margin was 47 percent, up 3 
percentage points from the year-ago quarter, and stable with the first quarter 
of 1998.  TI's second-quarter revenues and orders were affected by sharply 
declining prices for dynamic random access memories (DRAMs) and general 
weakness in the world semiconductor market.

Revenues in TI's core business of digital signal processing solutions 
increased from the year-ago quarter, despite weakness in modem and hard-disk 
drive demand, and were about even with the first quarter of 1998, reflecting 
TI's leadership position in this area.  Wireless communications continued to 
grow rapidly, reaching record levels in the quarter.  For the quarter, 
revenues for TI's digital signal processors grew 25 percent and generated 
record levels of new design-ins.

Prices of DRAMs continued to decline during the quarter, increasing the 
operating loss in TI's memory operations to $222 million, equivalent to $0.36 
per share.  In the year-ago quarter, the memory loss was $20 million.  Average 
unit prices for DRAM chips were down about 30 percent from the previous 
quarter, and were about 70 percent below second quarter 1997.

TI orders were $1934 million, down from $2657 million in the second quarter of 
1997, reflecting weakness in the world semiconductor market, with about 40 
percent of the change attributed to lower memory orders.  The remainder 
reflects general market weakness across other semiconductor products.  From 
the first quarter of 1998, TI orders were down 9 percent, with almost half of 
the change due to declines in memory and the remainder due to other 
semiconductor market weakness.  TI revenues for the second quarter were $2167 
million, down 15 percent from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to sharply 
lower prices in DRAMs. 

Excluding special items, profit from operations (PFO) for the quarter was $181 
million, down from the $336 million of the year-ago quarter, primarily due to 
increased pricing pressures for DRAMs. Income for the quarter was $142 
million, down from the $213 million in the second quarter of 1997, primarily 
due to the increased loss in memory.  Diluted earnings per share (EPS) were 
$0.35, compared with $0.54 in the second quarter of 1997.

Results for the quarter include a special charge of $233 million for a 
worldwide restructuring of support functions and consolidation of 
manufacturing operations, resulting in the elimination of 3,500 jobs.  There 
was also an $83 million gain in the quarter on the sale of TI's shares in the 
TI-Acer joint venture to Acer Corporation.  In the year-ago quarter, there was 
a special charge of $44 million for termination of joint-venture agreements in 
Thailand and a $66 million gain on the sale of three businesses, primarily 
software.

Including the effect of the special items, the loss from operations for the 
quarter was $52 million, compared with a PFO of $287 million in the second 
quarter of 1997.  Income was $43 million, compared with $224 million in the 
year-ago quarter, and EPS was $0.11, compared with $0.56.




                                      7

TI continues to benefit from a diverse portfolio of digital signal processing 
and analog products, with a broad range of applications.  New product 
developments during the quarter included two new digital signal processors in 
the 'C5000 family that combine the industry's lowest power dissipation with 
100 MIPS of performance. The 'C6701, the first floating-point member of the 
'C6000 family, was introduced and has claimed the performance leadership 
position in the floating-point market.

Additionally, a new radio-frequency device was announced that minimizes power 
requirements and costs in mobile phones.  Several developments in chipsets for 
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) high-speed digital modems included a 
new software feature that will greatly reduce ADSL installation complexity, 
while giving users more than 25 times the performance of current modems.  TI 
also announced plans for Siemens and Diamond Multimedia to develop products 
using TI's ADSL chipset.

OUTLOOK

Near-term growth in the world semiconductor market continues to be restrained 
by ongoing DRAM pricing pressures, weakness in Japan, and customer inventory 
corrections.  With these conditions, the world semiconductor market is now 
expected to decline in 1998.  As a result, TI expects pressure on its 
semiconductor revenues and margins to continue in the third quarter of 1998.

In view of the near-term market conditions, TI is stepping up efforts to 
further reduce discretionary spending.  TI is also implementing the previously 
announced restructuring plan for an estimated annualized cost savings of $270 
million when fully implemented by year end. 

TI remains positive about the outlook for the electronics industry.  The 
industry is entering a new era of digital connections, fueled by the rapidly 
growing wireless communications and computer network markets.  TI's plans for 
1999 are based on continued strong growth in digital signal processors, and a 
solid recovery in analog/mixed-signal markets. 

SECOND QUARTER 1998 SEGMENT REVIEW

NOTE:  UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS IN THIS REPORT ARE FROM 
CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND EXCLUDE SPECIAL ITEMS DETAILED EARLIER IN THIS 
REPORT.

SEMICONDUCTOR

Semiconductor orders in the second quarter declined by 30 percent from the 
same quarter a year ago, with almost half due to lower DRAM prices and the 
remainder due to general market weakness across other semiconductor products. 
Orders were also down sequentially by 15 percent, as declines in memory prices 
and weakness in the semiconductor market continued.  Excluding memory orders, 
which were $120 million in the second quarter, semiconductor orders were down 
20 percent from a year ago, and down 10 percent from the first quarter of 
1998.

Semiconductor revenues were down 17 percent from the second quarter of 1997, 
primarily due to memory, and down 6 percent from the first quarter of 1998, 
with about half due to softness in modem and hard-disk drive markets and the 
balance due to memory.  Excluding memory revenues, which were $177 million in 
the second quarter, semiconductor revenues were down 6 percent from a year 
ago, and down 4 percent from the first quarter of 1998.


                                      8

Revenues of digital signal processing solutions represented more than 50 
percent of the total semiconductor revenues in the second quarter of 1998.

Semiconductor PFO in the second quarter was $160 million, down $194 million 
from a year ago due to increased losses in memory.  Compared to the first 
quarter, PFO decreased by $69 million, with the loss in memory increasing by 
$93 million.  Excluding memory, operating margin improved by about 2 
percentage points from a year ago.

For the first six months of 1998, semiconductor orders were $3245 million, 
down $979 million from the first six months of 1997, with slightly more than 
half of the decrease coming from memory and the remainder from other 
semiconductor market weakness.  Semiconductor revenues of $3533 million were 
down $394 million, with memory being down $407 million.  PFO was $389 million, 
down from $633 million in the first half of 1997.  Excluding memory, PFO was 
up $26 million.

On June 18, 1998, TI announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the 
sale of its memory business to Micron Technology.  In connection with this 
sale, TI could recognize a material loss when the transaction closes, 
depending on the price of Micron common stock at that time. The transaction is 
subject to several contingencies, including satisfactory completion of due 
diligence, completion of appropriate agreements with various third parties 
(including relevant government authorities), as well as customary regulatory 
approvals (including Hart-Scott-Rodino and European Union antitrust reviews). 
The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year.

Under the terms of the agreement, Micron will purchase the assets of TI's 
semiconductor memory business for a combination of common stock and assumption 
of debt totaling approximately $1 billion (at Micron's stock price on July 20, 
1998).  The transaction includes the purchase of substantially all of TI's 
memory assets, as well as TI's shares in its two DRAM manufacturing joint 
ventures.

Upon closing, TI will receive approximately 28.9 million shares of Micron 
common stock, $740 million principal amount of seven-year, 6.5 percent notes 
convertible into an additional 12 million shares of Micron common stock, and a 
$210 million principal amount, seven year, 6.5 percent subordinated note.  The 
market value of these notes is expected to be substantially less than their 
face amount.  Micron also will assume approximately $190 million of 
government-sponsored debt associated with TI's Italian memory operations.

In addition to TI's memory assets, Micron will receive $750 million in
financing from TI to facilitate the deployment of Micron's technology 
throughout the business.  Micron and TI have also agreed upon a 10-year 
royalty-free semiconductor cross-license agreement, to begin January 1, 1999. 
TI will retain ownership of its related patents.

MATERIALS & CONTROLS

TI's Materials & Controls (M&C) business had a strong second quarter operating 
margin of 15 percent, up 2 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.  This 
performance reflects continued gains from the M&C best-cost producer strategy, 
despite flattening revenue due to the weakened market conditions in Asia. 





                                      9

Revenues in the second quarter were down slightly from the year-ago quarter at 
$245 million, primarily due to Asian market conditions.  Revenues were up 
slightly from the first quarter of 1998 due to normal seasonal conditions. The 
third quarter revenue is expected to reflect a seasonal reduction from first 
half revenue levels.

For the first half of 1998, M&C revenues were $487 million and about flat with 
the first half of 1997.  PFO improved by $14 million to $73 million, 
reflecting gains from the best-cost producer strategy.  Operating margin for 
the first six months of 1998 was 15 percent, up 3 percentage points from a 
year ago.

The TIRIS(TM) business continued steady progress, driven by strength in 
automotive security (immobilization) systems and growth in general market 
demand in radio-frequency identification systems.  The Mobil Speedpass(TM) 
program has completed the next phase of nationwide deployment to approximately 
3,300 service stations, at which more than 1.5 million motorists are 
purchasing gasoline with either keytags or vehicle-mounted car tags.

EDUCATIONAL & PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS

Led by ongoing strength in graphing calculator products, the Educational & 
Productivity Solutions (E&PS) business recognized record quarterly revenues. 
Revenues in the second quarter were $165 million, compared with $157 million 
in the year-ago quarter, and were more than double first quarter 1998, 
reflecting the normal seasonal pattern.  PFO was $37 million, up $5 million 
from a year ago.  Operating margin of 22 percent improved from last year by 2 
percentage points. 

For the first half of 1998, revenues were up 6 percent from a year ago, and 
PFO was up 15 percent from last year, reflecting strength from graphing 
products.  Operating margin improved to nearly 16 percent, more than a full 
percentage point above last year.

The business continues to strengthen its ties with the education community.  
E&PS kicked off the T(3) - Teachers Teaching with Technology educator training 
summer workshops.  Over 7,500 teachers are expected to participate in more 
than 300 workshops worldwide this summer. 

DIGITAL IMAGING

Progress continues in the digital imaging business.  (Note:  This business is 
included in Corporate Activities in the Business Segment footnote to the 
financial statements.)  The loss continues to narrow in this emerging business 
and is less than half the year-ago level.  Recently, 16 new projection 
products incorporating the TI DLP(TM) technology were introduced at an 
international trade show.  In June, TI's DLP technology was awarded an Emmy by 
the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for Outstanding Achievement in 
Engineering Development.

ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

For the first six months of 1998, TI's orders were $4070 million, down $1086 
million from the same period a year ago, almost half due to memory and the 
remainder to other semiconductor market weakness.  Revenues declined from 
$4823 million in the first half of 1997 to $4353 million in 1998, primarily 
due to memory.  Excluding special items, PFO was $403 million, down from $563


                                      10

million in the first half of 1997, due to increased losses in memory.  Income 
was $318 million, down $34 million, and EPS were $0.79 versus $0.89 in the 
year-ago period.

Including special items: The loss from operations for the first six months of 
1998 was $74 million, compared with a profit of $458 million in the year-ago 
period; income was $54 million, compared with $326 million; and EPS were 
$0.14, compared with $0.82 per share.

Results for the first quarter of 1998 include special charges of $244 million, 
primarily for discontinuing the DRAM manufacturing joint venture with Hitachi, 
Ltd.  Last year's first quarter results included a special charge of $56 
million, primarily related to severance actions and other costs associated 
with the sale of TI's mobile computing business.  Special items for the second 
quarters of 1998 and 1997 were referenced earlier in this report.

The income tax rate for the first half of 1998 was 34 percent, which is the 
estimated rate for the full year.

During the first six months of 1998, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term 
investments decreased by $616 million to $2404 million.  The discontinuance of 
the joint venture with Hitachi and the acquisition of those operating assets 
required $281 million of cash in the first quarter.  In addition, $91 million 
of cash was used to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of Amati 
Communications Corporation's common stock in the first quarter.

Cash flow from operating activities net of additions to property, plant, and 
equipment was a negative $434 million in the first half of 1998.  Capital 
expenditures in the first six months of 1998 were $698 million, compared to 
$562 million in the first half of 1997.

Capital expenditures totaled $314 million in the second quarter versus $337 
million in the second quarter of 1997.  Capital expenditures are projected to 
be about $1.2 billion for 1998.  Depreciation for the second quarter of 1998 
was $297 million, compared to $274 million in the same quarter a year ago, and 
$572 million for the first six months of 1998, compared with $519 million in 
the same period a year ago.  Depreciation for 1998 is projected to be at $1.1 
billion.

During the first half of 1998, TI repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares 
of its common stock as part of its previously stated intent to neutralize the 
potential dilutive effect of shares to be issued under employee stock options. 
At the end of the second quarter, the debt-to-total-capital ratio was .18, 
down slightly compared to the 1997 year-end value of .19.

As a result of losses in the memory business, TI's second quarter 1998 profit 
sharing expense was not significant.

                        PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  Legal Proceedings.

Beginning May 1, 1998, the Registrant filed lawsuits in United States District 
Courts in Texas and Virginia, and in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, 
France, Germany and Japan against Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. or 
related entities (collectively, "Hyundai") seeking injunctive relief for 
alleged infringement of over a dozen of the Registrant's patents relating to 
the manufacture and sale of semiconductor devices, including DRAMs.  Hyundai 
has responded by filing an action in United States District Court in New York 
based on a contract claim that its cross-license agreement with the Registrant 
has not yet expired, and by filing lawsuits in United States District Courts 
in Texas, Virginia and Delaware and a counterclaim in the Registrant's U.K. 
action, seeking injunctive relief against Registrant for alleged infringement 
of Hyundai's patents relating to the manufacture and sale of semiconductor 
devices, including DRAMs.
