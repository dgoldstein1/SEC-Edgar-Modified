<PAGE>   31
Date) of the Subordinated Notes and the Convertible Notes (collectively the

fraction whose numerator is $750 million and whose denominator is the aggregate
stated principal amount of the Notes delivered to Seller Note Purchasing

Seller (the "Debt Valuation").  Each party hereto shall (and shall cause its
respective Affiliates to) adopt and abide by the provisions of this Section 3.4
at their own expense, including without limitation the Debt Valuation and Issue
Price (as determined herein) for purposes of all Tax Returns filed by them and
shall not take any position inconsistent therewith in connection with any
examination of any Tax Return, any refund claim, any judicial litigation
proceeding but only if doing otherwise in such judicial litigation proceeding
would materially prejudice the other party, or otherwise until there has been a
final "determination" (within the meaning of Code Section 1313(a)) or any other
event which finally and conclusively establishes the value of the Notes.  In
the event that the position being taken in accordance with this Section 3.4 is
being challenged by any Taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the
dispute shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of such dispute and the
parties hereto shall consult with each other concerning resolution of the
dispute.

on the Business.  To the knowledge of Seller, no fact or circumstance exists
which could reasonably be expected to cause any such Permit and/or Approval to
be revoked or rendered nonrenewable by Buyer or would require, as a condition
to the continuation or renewal of such Permit and/or Approval, capital
improvements or repairs at the Acquired Facilities costing in the aggregate in
excess of $100,000, over the amount, if any, of the reserves shown on the
Closing Balance Sheet.

any Retained Environmental Liability, (B) any Remedial Activity, (C) the
conduct of any Hazardous Material Activities associated with the Pre-Closing
Seller Operations, or (D) any Environmental Requirement applicable to the
Seller Group members, the Acquired Assets, or the

Business (except to the extent that any such Environmental Requirement,
obligations or Claim does not (x) result in aggregate Liabilities in excess of
$250,000 or (y) have a Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability
of the Buyer to carry on the Business; and to the knowledge of Seller, there
are no other facts, circumstances, events or incidents involving the Hazardous
Material Activities associated with the Pre-Closing Seller Operations which
could give rise to any such Liabilities.

                     (vi)   To the knowledge of Seller, no asbestos-containing
materials are present on the Acquired Facilities, other than the asbestos-
containing material which is on or part of the Acquired Facilities and is not
friable, complies with applicable Environmental Requirements applicable thereto

applicable thereto as of the Closing Date and is in good repair according to
the current standards and practices governing such material except to the
extent the same will not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Materials which are reasonably necessary for the conduct of the Business and

Environmental Requirements applicable thereto as of the Closing Date, no
Hazardous Material is, or at the Closing Date will be, stored or kept at any

Seller Group to have made, available to Buyer for review within ten (10) days
of the date of this Agreement, all material records, environmental audits,

              (a)    Organization and Qualification.  Each Joint Venture is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease the properties and assets it now owns,
operates and leases and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted.
True, correct and complete copies of the organizational documents of each Joint
Venture, each with all amendments thereto, have been delivered to Buyer.  Each
Joint Venture is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its assets or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification or license necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a JV Material Adverse Effect.

              (b)    Authority.  Each Joint Venture shall have all requisite
power and authority to enter into, execute and deliver such agreements which
are required to effect valid transfers of Seller's interests in the Joint
Venture to the Buyer at the Closing (the "JV Transfer Agreements") as
contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements, to perform its
obligations thereunder, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby.  The execution and delivery of such agreements by each Joint
Venture, the performance by each Joint Venture of its obligations under such
agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby shall
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of each Joint Venture and (assuming due execution and delivery by the
Buyer of such agreements as required) such agreements, when executed and
delivered, will constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of each Joint
Venture enforceable against such Joint Venture in accordance with their terms,
subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy,
reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors'
rights, and, with respect to the remedy of specific performance, equitable
doctrines applicable thereto.

              (c)    No Violations.  The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Related Agreements, the performance by each Joint Venture of
its obligations under such agreements and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby, will not conflict with, contravene, result in a violation
or breach of or default under (with or without the giving of notice or the
lapse of time or both), create in any other Person a right of claim of
termination, amendment, or require modification, acceleration or cancellation
of, or result in the creation of any Lien (or any obligation to create any
Lien) upon any of the properties or assets of the Joint Ventures under (i) any
provision of any of the organizational documents of each Joint Venture, (ii)
any Law applicable to the Joint Ventures or any of their respective properties
or assets assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or permits and
filings or notifications set forth in Section 4.2(g) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter are duly and timely obtained or made, (iii) except as to which requisite
waivers or consents have been obtained and except for the consents and
approvals required under the agreements and instruments listed in Section
4.2(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, any Contract, to which a Joint Venture
is a party or by which any of their respective properties or assets may be
bound; other than any of the foregoing under clauses (ii) and (iii) which would
not result in a JV Material Adverse Effect.  Except as set forth in Section
4.2(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, neither the execution and delivery of
any JV Transfer Agreement by the Joint Ventures, nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, will result in the loss to Buyer
of any material benefit enjoyed by any member of the Seller Group or the Joint
Ventures in connection with the Business or the Acquired Assets.

              (d)    Capitalization.  Section 4.2(d) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter contains a true, correct and complete description of the equity or other
ownership interests of each Joint Venture.  All of such equity or other
ownership interests are owned beneficially and of record by such Persons set
forth in Section 4.1(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.  Section 4.2(d) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter also lists for each Joint Venture all subscriptions,
options, warrants, conversion or other rights, agreements, commitments,
arrangements or understandings of any kind, outstanding obligating either Joint
Venture, contingently or otherwise, to issue or sell, or cause to be issued or

Closing, except as set forth in Section 4.2(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
(i) there will be no preemptive or similar rights with respect to the JV
Interests, (ii) there will be no subscriptions, options, warrants, conversion

kind obligating either Joint Venture, contingently or otherwise, to issue or
sell, or cause to be issued or sold, any equity or other ownership interest in
either Joint Venture, and (iii) there will be no outstanding contractual or
other rights or obligations to or of either Joint Venture to repurchase, redeem

4.2(e) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

                     (ii)   At the time of the Closing, Seller will have the

against payment therefore as contemplated by Section 3.2 will transfer to Buyer
good and valid title to, and beneficial ownership of, the JV Interests, free
and clear of all Liens and, upon execution and delivery of the JV Amendments as
contemplated by Section 9.1(c), Buyer shall be entitled to the rights under
each of the JV Agreements, after giving effect to the JV Amendments, and such
agreements as so amended shall be valid, binding and enforceable in accordance
with their terms subject, as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors' rights and, with respect to the remedy of specific performance,
equitable doctrines applicable thereto.  The sale of the JV Interests will not
give rise to any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal and will not
violate any Laws.

sets forth a true, correct and complete list of the following Contracts of each
Joint Venture, other than such Contracts disclosed under clause (F) of Section

<PAGE>   53
                     (vi)   Contracts relating to any material debt, letter of
credit, bank financing or similar arrangements (including guarantees).

                     (vii)  Volume purchase and master agreements which require
payment in excess of $1 million in any one case.

                     (viii) Agreements primarily for indemnification
obligations with respect to the sale of products of either Joint Venture other
than in the ordinary course of business.

                     (ix)   Any other Contract to which either Joint Venture is
a party which is material to the financial condition, operations (but not

modified (except as specified in Section 4.2(f) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter) and each Joint Venture has performed all the obligations imposed upon
such Joint Venture under such Contracts and is not in default or breach of any
term thereunder other than such defaults or breaches which in the aggregate
would not reasonably be expected to have a JV Material Adverse Effect.  No
termination rights in respect of any of such Contracts have been exercised by
either Joint Venture or other parties thereto.  To the knowledge of Seller,
none of the other parties to any of such Contracts is in default or breach of
any terms thereunder, nor is Seller aware of any event which, with the passage
of time, the giving of notice or both, would constitute a default or breach of
any term of any such Contract by any such other party, other than such defaults
or breaches which, in the aggregate, would not result in a JV Material Adverse
Effect.

Letter lists all Claims pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller Group,
threatened against either Joint Venture with respect to its business, except
for such Claims which individually or in the aggregate have not had or could
not reasonably be expected to have a JV Material Adverse Effect. Neither Joint
Venture is in default under, or in violation of, any judgment, order, writ,
injunction or decree of any Governmental Agency relating thereto, except for
those defaults or violations, which in the aggregate would not have, or
reasonably be expected to have, a JV Material Adverse Effect.

              (l)    Compliance with Laws; Permits.

                     (i)    Except as set forth in Section 4.2(l) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, the business of each Joint Venture is being conducted in

not reasonably be expected to have a JV Material Adverse Effect.

Closing will have, all Permits and/or Approvals (the "JV Permits and
Approvals") required to conduct the business of each Joint Venture as presently
conducted, other than such JV Permits and Approvals the failure to obtain which
would not in the aggregate reasonably be expected to result in a JV Material
Adverse Effect.  All JV Permits and Approvals are being complied with in all
material respects and will not be terminated or revoked as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                     (iii)  Except as set forth in Section 4.2(l) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter, there are no judgments, orders, injunctions, decrees,
stipulations, awards (whether rendered by a Governmental Agency or by
arbitration) or private settlement agreements involving either Joint Venture,
other than any of the foregoing which have not and would not in the aggregate
result in a JV Material Adverse Effect.  All of the foregoing which are final
and nonappealable are being complied with in all material respects.

              (m)    Real Property and Facilities.

                     (i)    No real property is or has been owned, leased or

Disclosure Letter, the Joint Ventures hold the good and fee simple title to, or
a valid leasehold interest in, the Joint Venture Facilities and the other Joint

                     (iii)  The Joint Venture Assets are now, and will be at
the time of the Closing, free of physical or mechanical defects, in good
operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear accepted), structurally
sound, in compliance with applicable Laws, contractual obligations,
Environmental Requirements, and Permits and/or Approvals applicable thereto,
have been reasonably maintained consistent with standards generally followed by
similar business and building owners and users, and are adequate for the
purposes for which they are being used by the Joint Ventures, except for any of
the foregoing that is not reasonably likely to have a JV Material Adverse
Effect.

                     (iv)   No condemnation, zoning, land use or Tax
imposition, or other Proceeding has been instituted with respect to any Joint
Venture Assets which could have a JV Material Adverse Effect and, to the
knowledge of Seller, no such Proceeding is planned or threatened.

              (n)    Environmental Matters.

                     (i)    Except as would not reasonably be expected to
result, in the aggregate, in a JV Material Adverse Effect, (1) no Contamination
is present or has been present at, in, on or





                                      -45-
<PAGE>   56
under any of the Joint Venture Facilities, (2) to Seller's knowledge, no
Contamination is present on, in, or about any Disposal Facility utilized by the
Joint Ventures (other than Contamination resulting from Hazardous Material
Activities of Buyer or its Subsidiaries when they were Buyer's Subsidiaries at
such Disposal Facility), (3) no Contamination described in clauses (1) or (2)
has migrated, or is reasonably likely to, migrate to or from such Joint Venture
Facility or, to Seller's knowledge, such Disposal Facility (4) on or before the
last date that a Joint Venture owned, leased or occupied a Former Facility or
that the Former Facility was used for any Joint Venture operations, no
Contamination (other than Contamination resulting from Hazardous Material
Activities of Buyer or its Subsidiaries when they were Buyer's Subsidiaries at
such Former Facility) was present on, in, under or about said Former Facility,
and (5) no Contamination described in clause (4) hereof has migrated, or is
reasonably likely to migrate, to or from any such Former Facility.

                     (ii)   All Hazardous Material Activities conducted by the
Joint Ventures prior to the Closing Date have complied in all material respects
with the Environmental Requirements, applicable to such activities at the time
they were conducted, and such Hazardous Material Activities have not resulted
in the exposure of any employee of either of the Joint Ventures or other Person
to a Hazardous Material in a manner which has or will cause an adverse health
effect to said employee or Person, except to the extent that any noncompliance
or exposure resulting from the Hazardous Material Activities of each Joint
Venture cannot reasonably be expected to result, in the aggregate, in a JV
Material Adverse Effect.

                     (iii)  All Permits and/or Approvals required for the
conduct of the Hazardous Material Activities associated with the Business
performed by each Joint Venture prior to the Closing are held by the Joint
Ventures and are in full force and effect.  The Joint Ventures have complied
with all covenants and conditions thereof in all material respects, except as
any noncompliance or failure to obtain such Permits and/or Approvals would not,
in the aggregate, result in a JV Material Adverse Effect.  With respect to such
Permits and/or Approvals, no fact or circumstance exists which could cause any
such Permit and/or Approval to be revoked or rendered non-renewable or would
require, as a condition to the continuation or renewal of such Permit and/or
Approval, or any capital improvements or repairs, except to the extent such
revocations, failures to renew or required capital improvements or repairs
would not, in the aggregate, result in a JV Material Adverse Effect.

                     (iv)   Except as would not, in the aggregate, result in a
JV Material Adverse Effect, neither of the Joint Ventures nor their operations
are subject to any voluntary or involuntary obligations or any pending or
threatened Claims or Losses respecting (i) any Remedial Activity (whether at
any Joint Venture Facility or any Former Facility or Disposal Facility of the
Joint Ventures), (ii) the conduct of any Hazardous Material Activities
associated with the operations of either Joint Venture, or (iii) any
Environmental Requirement applicable to the operations of either Joint Venture;
and, to the knowledge of each member of the Seller Group, there are no other
facts, circumstances, events or incidents involving the Hazardous Material
Activities associated with the Joint Ventures or their operations which could
give rise to any such obligation or Claims or Losses.

                                   ARTICLE V

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

       Except as disclosed in the Buyer Disclosure Letter (which shall make
specific reference to only that particular representation and warranty as to
which each disclosure included therein relates and, to the extent any
disclosure therein relates to more than one representation or warranty, such
disclosure letter shall include a specific cross-reference to the other
representations or warranties to which such disclosure relates), Buyer
represents and warrants to Seller as set forth below:

       5.1    Organization and Qualification.  Buyer is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease the properties and assets it now owns,
operates and leases and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted.
True, correct and complete copies of the Certificate of Incorporation (or
similar documents) and By-laws (or similar documents) of the Buyer, each with
all amendments thereto, have been delivered to Seller.  The Buyer is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its assets or the nature
of its activities makes such qualification or license necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

       5.2    Corporate Authority.  Buyer has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and the Related
Agreements, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.  The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the Related Agreements by Buyer and any Buyer
designee (as applicable), the performance by Buyer and any Buyer designee (as
applicable) of its obligations under this Agreement and the Related Agreements,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
of the Buyer and any Buyer designee (as applicable) (assuming due execution and
delivery by each member of the Seller Group of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements) and this Agreement and the Related Agreements constitute legal,
valid and binding obligations of the Buyer (or any Buyer designee) enforceable
against the Buyer (or such designee) in accordance with their terms (subject,
as to the enforcement of remedies, to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization,
insolvency, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors' rights, and, with
respect to the remedy of specific performance, equitable doctrines applicable
thereto).  No approval by the stockholders of Buyer is required with respect to
the execution and delivery by Buyer of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements, and performance by Buyer of its obligations hereunder or thereunder
including the issuance and delivery of the Common Stock, the Convertible Notes
and the Subordinated Notes.  Based on Seller's representations and warranties
in Section 4.1(u) hereof, no registration statement is required to be filed by
Buyer pursuant to the Securities Act in connection with the issuance and
delivery to Seller of the Common Stock, the Convertible Notes and the
Subordinated Notes (except as provided in the Securities Rights and
Restrictions Agreement).

<PAGE>   59
       5.3    No Violations.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Related Agreements by Buyer, the performance by Buyer of its obligations
under this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including the issuance of the
Common Stock, the Convertible Notes and the Subordinated Notes), do not and
will not conflict with, contravene, result in a violation or breach of or
default under (with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time or
both), create in any other Person a right or claim of termination, amendment,
or require modification, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of any Lien (or any obligation to create any Lien) upon any of the
properties or assets of Buyer under (i) any provision of any of the
organizational documents of Buyer, (ii) any Law applicable to Buyer or any of
its properties or assets assuming the consents, approvals, authorizations or
permits and filings or notifications set forth in Sections 5.6 and 5.7 of the
Buyer Disclosure Letter are duly and timely obtained or made, (iii) the
Indenture (as supplemented) and (iv) Buyer's bank and other financing
agreements or any other of its material agreements, other than any of the
foregoing under clause (ii) which would not (A) result in a Liability of
$100,000 in any one case or $500,000 in the aggregate, or (B) individually or
in the aggregate, have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

       5.4    Capitalization.  Section 5.4 of the Buyer Disclosure Letter
contains a true, correct and complete description of the shares of stock or
other equity or ownership interests that are authorized, issued and
outstanding, of Buyer.  All of such outstanding shares of stock or other equity
or ownership interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully-paid and
nonassessable, and are owned beneficially and of record by such Persons to be
set forth in Section 5.4 of the Buyer Disclosure Letter, free and clear of any
Liens.  Section 5.4 of the Buyer Disclosure Letter also lists all
subscriptions, options, warrants, conversion or other rights, agreements,
commitments, arrangements or understandings of any kind outstanding obligating
Buyer, contingently or otherwise, to issue or sell, or cause to be issued or
sold, any shares of capital stock.

       5.5    Valid Issuance of Buyer Common Stock.  Upon issuance and delivery
of Buyer Common Stock to Seller at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement
against payment of the consideration therefore contemplated hereby, the Buyer
Common Stock will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable free and
clear of all Liens other than (a) Liens set forth in the Securities Rights and
Restrictions Agreement and (b) any Liens which may be created by Seller.  The
delivery of the Buyer Common Stock at the Closing will transfer to Seller good,
absolute and valid title to, and beneficial ownership of, the Buyer Common
Stock, other than Liens described in (a) and (b) of the preceding sentence.
The issuance and sale of the Buyer Common Stock pursuant hereto will not give
rise to any preemptive rights or rights of first refusal and will not violate
any Law.

       5.6    Valid Authorization of Notes.  The Convertible Notes and
Subordinated Notes have been duly and validly authorized, and, when executed
and authenticated and delivered and acquired by Seller in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, will be valid and binding obligations of Buyer
enforceable in accordance with their terms, and the shares issued upon
conversion of the Convertible Notes shall be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable free and clear of all Liens.

       5.7    SEC Filings; Financial Statements.  Buyer has furnished or made
available to Seller true, correct and complete copies of its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the years ended August 29, 1996 and August 28, 1997, and each
report (including any amendments thereto) filed under the Exchange Act by the
Buyer with the SEC since August 29, 1996 (the "Buyer SEC Documents").  All
Buyer SEC Documents complied as to form with the requirements of the Exchange
Act.  None of the Buyer SEC Documents as of the dates they were respectively
filed with the SEC contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except to the extent corrected by a subsequently
filed Buyer SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof.  Each of the balance
sheets (including any related notes) for the fiscal year or periods ending on
August 29, 1996 and thereafter included in the Buyer SEC Documents fairly
presents the financial condition of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries as of its
date and each of the statements of income and changes in financial position
(including any related notes) for the fiscal year or periods ending on August
29, 1996 or thereafter included in the Buyer SEC Documents fairly presents the
results of operations or changes in cash flows, as the case may be, of the
Buyer and its Subsidiaries for the respective periods set forth therein, in
accordance with, in the case of audited financial statements, GAAP consistently
applied except as otherwise disclosed therein, or, in the case of unaudited
financial statements, GAAP consistently applied, except as otherwise disclosed
therein or as otherwise permitted by the instructions to Form 10-Q of the SEC.
All of the foregoing financial statements are in accordance with the books and
records of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries.

       5.8    Litigation.  Section 5.8 of the Buyer Disclosure Letter lists all
Claims pending or, to the knowledge of Buyer, threatened with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby except for such Claims which individually or
in the aggregate have not or could not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.  Neither Buyer nor its Subsidiaries are in default
under, or in violation of, any judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of
any Governmental Agency with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
except for those defaults or violations which in the aggregate would not have,
or reasonably be expected to have, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

       5.9    Knowledge.  With respect to those representations qualified by
"knowledge of Buyer," Buyer shall be deemed to be aware of all matters of which
an executive officer of Buyer is aware.

              (a)    Seller shall form prior to the Closing a new direct wholly
owned company under the laws of the Republic of Singapore (of a type selected
by Buyer, which is not described in U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-
2(b)(8) and for which a "check-the-box" election to be treated as other than a
corporation has not been made (except where such an election has been made in
accordance with instructions from Buyer pursuant to Section 7.6)) ("Singapore
Newco").  Upon the formation of Singapore Newco, Seller shall cause (i)
Singapore Operating Company to assign, transfer, convey and deliver to
Singapore Newco, and Singapore Newco to accept from Singapore Operating
Company, all right, title and interest in all of Singapore Operating Company's
assets constituting Acquired Assets and Singapore Newco will allot and issue to
Seller all of the capital stock of Singapore Newco (other than the initial two
subscriber shares already held by Seller) and (ii) Singapore Newco to assume
only those liabilities of Singapore Operating Company constituting Assumed
Liabilities.

              (b)    Subject to Section 6.6, prior to the Closing, Seller shall
cause, through a "contribution-in-kind" transaction pursuant to Sections 2254,
2255, 2342 and 2343 of the Italian Civil Code, (i) Italian Operating Company to
assign, transfer, convey and deliver to a newly formed company under the laws
of Italy (which is not described in U.S. Treasury Regulation Section
301.7701-2(b)(8) and for which a "check-the-box" election to be treated as
other than a corporation has not been made (except where such an election has
been made in accordance with instructions from Buyer pursuant to Section 7.6))
("Italian Newco"), and Italian Newco to accept from Italian Operating Company,
all right, title and interest in all of Italian Operating Company's assets
constituting Acquired Assets in exchange for all of the capital stock of
Italian Newco, and (ii) Italian Newco to assume only those liabilities of
Italian Operating Company constituting Assumed Liabilities.  Within forty-five
(45) days from the date hereof, Seller shall cause Italian Operating Company
and Italian Newco to execute a contribution-in-kind agreement (including
appropriate schedules of assets to be assigned to, and specific liabilities
(including Contract liabilities) to be assumed by, Italian Newco) with terms
and conditions reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.

              (c)    Except as set forth in subparagraphs (a) and (b) above,
Singapore Newco and Italian Newco shall not, and Seller shall cause them not
to, incur, directly or indirectly through any other Person, any obligations or
liabilities of any kind whatsoever or enter into any arrangements with any
Person without the prior written consent of Buyer.

              (d)    Seller will organize a new wholly owned Delaware
corporation or designate one of its existing Subsidiaries ("Seller Note
Purchasing Subsidiary") to serve as the Seller Note Purchasing Subsidiary.  The
Seller Note Purchasing Subsidiary will not hold any Acquired Assets.  Upon the
formation or designation of Seller Note Purchasing Subsidiary, Seller shall
transfer to Seller Note Purchasing Subsidiary, and Seller shall cause Seller
Note Purchasing Subsidiary to accept from Seller an amount equal to the Cash
Payment.

       6.3    Regulatory Matters.

              (a)    The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all Permits and/or Approvals which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this

and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case

information relating to Seller and Buyer, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Agency in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide either party
with a right to review any information provided by the other party to any
Governmental Agency on a confidential basis in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.  In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties
hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.  The parties hereto

       6.4    Working Capital Requirement.

              (a)    Within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date,
Seller shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Buyer an unaudited balance
sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date (the "Preliminary Balance Sheet").
The Preliminary Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied and consistent with GAAP principles used to prepare the
March Balance Sheet.  In the event Working Capital at the Closing Date as
reflected on the Preliminary Balance Sheet is less than the Target Amount, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the aggregate of the shortfall.
In the event Working Capital at the Closing Date as reflected on the
Preliminary Balance Sheet is in excess of the Target Amount, then Buyer shall
pay to Seller an amount equal to the excess.  All amounts payable (the "Working
Capital Requirement") under this subsection 6.4(a) shall be paid in cash within
five (5) days after the preparation of the Preliminary Balance Sheet by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
the recipient.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Target Amount" means U.S. $150
million; provided, however, that if the Closing has not occurred by September
30, 1998 (the "Target Closing Date"), the U.S. $150 million amount shall be
decreased (the "Working Capital Reduction") by U.S. $5 million at the end of
each fourteen-day period commencing on the Business Day immediately following
the Target Closing Date; provided, further, that, notwithstanding the
immediately preceding proviso, the Working Capital Reduction shall not take
effect in the event the Closing has not occurred by reason of the failure to
comply with any material covenant or agreement in this Agreement by Seller
which has not been cured within ten (10) days following receipt by Seller of
notice of such breach or failure to comply.

              (b)    Within 120 days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller an audited balance sheet of the
Business as of the Closing Date (the "Adjusted Balance Sheet").  The Adjusted
Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied and
consistent with the GAAP principles used to prepare the March Balance Sheet.
Working Capital as of the Closing Date shall be derived from the Adjusted
Balance Sheet.  Following delivery by Buyer to Seller of the Adjusted Balance
Sheet, Buyer shall give to Seller, and any independent auditors retained by
Seller, reasonable access during Buyer's business hours to those books and
records of the Business in the possession of Buyer and any personnel which
relate to the preparation of the Adjusted Balance Sheet and to the workpapers
of Buyer and its independent auditors for purposes of resolving any disputes
concerning the Adjusted Balance Sheet and the calculation of Working Capital.

              (c)    Seller shall have thirty (30) days following delivery of
the Adjusted Balance Sheet during which to notify Buyer in writing (the "Notice
of Objection") of any good faith objections to the calculation of Working
Capital or the Adjusted Balance Sheet as it affects such calculation, setting
forth a reasonably specific and detailed description of its objections and the
dollar amount of each objection.  If Seller objects to the Adjusted Balance
Sheet, or Buyer's calculation of Working Capital as reflected thereon, Buyer
and Seller shall attempt to resolve any such objections within fifteen (15)
days of the receipt by Buyer of the Notice of Objection.

<PAGE>   65
              (d)    If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such dispute
within the fifteen (15) day period referred to in Section 6.4(c) above, Buyer
and Seller shall each submit the name of another "big six" independent
accounting firm which does not at the time provide, and has not in the prior
two years provided, services to either Buyer or Seller or any Affiliate of
Buyer or Seller, and the firm shall be selected by lot from these two firms.
Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates and representatives to, provide full cooperation to such independent
accounting firm (the "Independent Accounting Firm").  The Independent
Accounting Firm shall (x) act in its capacity as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, (y) review only those matters as to which there is a dispute
between the parties and (z) be instructed to reach its conclusions regarding
any such dispute within thirty (30) days after its appointment and provide a
written explanation of its decision.  In the event that Seller and Buyer submit
any dispute to arbitration, each such party may submit a "position paper" to
the Independent Accounting Firm setting forth the position of such party with
respect to such dispute, to be considered by such Independent Accounting Firm
as it deems fit.  The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
final and binding on the parties and shall be deemed a final arbitration award
that is enforceable pursuant to all terms of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. Sec. 1 et seq.  Any expenses relating to the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer.

              (e)    If Seller does not deliver the Notice of Objection in
accordance with Section 6.4(c) above (i.e., within a thirty day period), the
Adjusted Balance Sheet (together with Buyer's calculation of Working Capital
reflected thereon), shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties
to this Agreement and shall become the "Closing Balance Sheet."  In the event
that Seller delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance with the provisions
above and Buyer and Seller are able to resolve such dispute by mutual
agreement, the Adjusted Balance Sheet, together with Buyer's calculation of
Working Capital reflected thereon, to the extent modified by mutual agreement
of such parties, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of the parties to
this Agreement and shall become the "Closing Balance Sheet."  In the event that
Seller delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance with the provisions above
and Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement,
the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding
on the parties and the Adjusted Balance Sheet, together with Buyer's
calculation of Working Capital reflected thereon, to the extent modified by the
Independent Accounting Firm, shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of
the parties to this Agreement and shall become the "Closing Balance Sheet." The
calculations of Working Capital reflected on any such Closing Balance Sheet
shall be conclusive and binding on all of the parties to this Agreement and no
further adjustments shall be made thereto.

              (f)    In the event that Working Capital as reflected on the
Closing Balance Sheet is less than the Target Amount when added to the Working
Capital Requirement actually paid, then Seller shall pay to Buyer in cash
within five (5) days after determination of the Closing Balance Sheet an amount
equal to the aggregate of the shortfall (the "Shortfall") together with
interest thereon at the rate of 6% from the Closing Date until the date of
payment of the Shortfall, and if not made within five (5) days after
determination of the Closing Balance Sheet, taking into account all Notice of
Objection and dispute resolution periods set forth in this Section 6.4, the
Shortfall shall bear





                                      -55-
<PAGE>   66
interest from the Closing Date until the date of payment of the Shortfall at
the rate of 15% per annum.  In the event that Working Capital as reflected on
the Closing Balance Sheet is greater than the Target Amount when added to the
Working Capital Requirement actually paid, then Buyer shall pay to Seller in
cash within five (5) days after determination of the Closing Balance Sheet an
amount equal to the aggregate of the excess (the "Excess") together with
interest thereon at the rate of 6% from the Closing Date until the date of
payment of the Excess, and if not made within five (5) days after determination
of the Closing Balance Sheet, taking into account all Notice of Objection and
dispute resolution periods set forth in this Section 6.4, the Excess shall bear
interest from the Closing Date until the date of payment of the Excess at the
rate of 15% per annum.  Any and all amounts payable in accordance with this
Section 6.4(f) shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by either Seller or Buyer, as the case may be.

       6.5    Investment Incentives.  Seller shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining and maintaining incentives from
the EDB, including without limitation requesting TECH to assist Buyer in
negotiating with the EDB investment incentives for the benefit of Singapore
Newco after giving effect to the Reorganization and the other transactions
contemplated in this Agreement.

       6.6    Italian Operations.  Seller and Buyer agree to negotiate in good
faith and to use all commercially reasonable efforts to agree, within forty-
five (45) days after the date hereof, (i) on mutually acceptable terms and
conditions to apply to the transfer at the Closing of those Acquired Assets and
Assumed Liabilities associated with Seller's Italian operations to be
transferred by Seller to Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and (ii)
on an appropriate amendment or supplement to this Agreement adequately
reflecting such terms and conditions, including appropriate amendments to the
conditions precedent to the Closing.

       6.7    Transition Services.  Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good
faith the Transition Services Agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit I as may be reasonably modified by the mutual agreement of
the parties, pursuant to which Seller shall provide Buyer, on a transitional
basis following the Closing Date, with all services historically provided to
the Business (hereinafter, the "Transition Services") reasonably necessary to
support the continued operation of the Business (including the operations of
Italian Operating Company and Singapore Operating Company) and pursuant to
which, from the Closing Date until the first anniversary thereof, Buyer will
(i) request that KTI continue to manufacture and supply to Buyer for resale to
Seller SDRAM or DRAM products for military and aerospace applications in
substantially the same aggregate volumes as are currently supplied and, to the
extent such products are so available from KTI to Buyer, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to supply such products to Seller in
substantially the same aggregate volumes as are currently supplied; provided,
however, that Buyer shall not be liable for the failure to supply such products
to Seller in the event of KTI's failure to manufacture and supply such products
to Buyer for resale to Seller, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to
continue to provide testing services for such products at the Singapore
assembly/test facility in substantially the same manner as currently provided,
in each case, at prices to be mutually agreed upon.

       6.8    Working Capital.  Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller Group
to, use commercially reasonable efforts to manage the Working Capital of the
Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.

       6.9    Financial Statements.  As soon as practicable following the date
hereof and prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer with respect to
the Business on a combined basis (including Seller's JV Interests as an equity
investment) audited balance sheets as of December 31, 1996 and as of December
31, 1997, together with the related audited statements of income and cash flow
for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 1996 and December 31, 1997, the
unaudited statement of income and cash flow for the three-month period ended
March 31, 1998, and the unaudited balance sheet as of June 30, 1998 and the
related unaudited statement of income and cash flow for the six-month period
then ended.  All such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby
(except, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, for the absence of
notes thereto) and in the case of the balance sheets, consistent with the GAAP
principles used to prepare the March Balance Sheet.  Seller shall make
available to Buyer, and Buyer's auditors, Seller's work papers and backup
materials used in preparation of all such financial statements.

       6.10   Seller Disclosure Letter.  As soon as practicable and in no event
later than the date thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer the Seller Disclosure Letter which shall include all of
Seller's disclosure schedules contemplated by this Agreement.  The Seller
Disclosure Letter shall make specific reference to only that particular Section
(or, with respect to representations and warranties, that particular
subsection) as to which each disclosure schedule included therein relates and,
to the extent any disclosure schedule included therein relates to more than one
Section (or more than one representation and warranty), then such disclosure
schedule shall include a specific cross-reference to the other Sections (or
other representations and warranties) to which such disclosure schedule
relates.  Buyer shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of its receipt of
the Seller Disclosure Letter in which to object to any of Seller's disclosure
included in such Seller Disclosure Letter, which objection shall be made by
sending to Seller a written notice (a "Disclosure Objection").

       6.11   Buyer Disclosure Letter.  As soon as practicable and in no event
later than the date thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Buyer shall deliver
to Seller the Buyer Disclosure Letter which shall include all of Buyer's

Letter shall make specific reference to only that particular Section (or, with
respect to representations and warranties, that particular subsection) as to
which each disclosure schedule included therein relates and, to the extent any
disclosure schedule included therein relates to more than one Section (or more
than one representation or warranty), then such disclosure schedule shall
include a specific cross-reference to the other Sections (or other
representations and warranties) to which such disclosure schedule relates.
Seller shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of its receipt of the Buyer
Disclosure Letter in which to object to any of Buyer's disclosure included in

       6.12   JV Amendments.  Seller and Buyer agree to negotiate in good faith

its Affiliates is a party which Contract is for the benefit of the Joint
Venture.

       6.13   Acquired Facilities.  The following expenses of the Acquired
Facilities, which shall be reflected in a closing statement (the "Closing
Statement") shall be apportioned between Seller and Buyer at the Closing in
accordance with the following:

              (a)    Seller shall pay the full amount of any real estate Taxes,
bonds, assessments or other governmental levies against the Acquired
Facilities, which are not Permitted Liens, on or before the Closing Date.

              (b)    Except as expressly provided to the contrary in this
Agreement, rent, insurance premiums, amounts payable under the Transferred
Contracts, operating expenses, utility consumption fees and any other recurring
occupancy charges applicable to the Acquired Facilities under the Transferred
Contracts shall be prorated as of the Closing Date.  In this regard, Seller
shall cause all the utility meters to be read on the Closing Date, and will be
responsible for the cost of all utilities used prior to the Closing Date.

              (c)    Except as herein expressly provided to the contrary,
Seller shall pay for all costs customarily associated with the conveyance of
the Acquired Facilities to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement (including,
without limitation, all Transfer Taxes, recording or registration fees and the
like customarily paid by sellers of real property in the jurisdiction in which
the Acquired Facilities are located); provided, however, that the cost of any
title insurance policy and title opinions shall be paid by Buyer.

              (d)    Real estate escrow fees and all other customary real

Date and adjusted to the actual allocation as soon after the Closing Date as
feasible.  Either party owing the other party a sum of money based on such
subsequent adjustment shall promptly pay said sum to the other party, together
with interest thereon at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum from the
Closing Date to the date of payment if payment is not made within ten (10) days
after delivery of a bill therefor.

       6.14   Certain Rights.  Buyer shall have the option, upon delivery of a

<PAGE>   69
own license not related to the Business, Seller's rights and benefits under the
agreement between Seller and Rambus Inc. and thereupon, such license shall be
deemed an Acquired Asset hereunder.

       6.15   Licenses of Intellectual Property.

              (a)    Seller hereby grants to Buyer (and any successor to Buyer
or to any division or line of business of Buyer (the "Successor")) a worldwide,
perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, royalty free license under all
Intellectual Property (other than Patents and Acquired Intellectual Property)
(the "Licensed IP") of any member of the Seller Group owned or licensable by
any such member to operate the Business substantially in the manner such
Business was operated by the Seller Group and to make, have made, use, sell,
offer for sale and import any products.  The Licensed IP may not be sublicensed
or transferred by Buyer (or its Successors), except in connection with the
licensing or transfer by Buyer (or its Successors), of substantial other
Intellectual Property and under substantially the same terms and conditions as
such other Intellectual Property of Buyer (or its Successors), is licensed or
transferred; provided, however, that such sublicense or transfer may not grant
to the sublicensee or transferee broader rights than that granted to Buyer
hereunder.  In addition, Buyer or its Successors shall not transfer or
sublicense any Trade Secrets constituting Licensed IP except pursuant to a non-
disclosure agreement at least as protective of such Trade Secrets as it is of
Buyer's (or its Successor's), own Trade Secrets.

              (b)    Subject to, and without in any way limiting the provisions
of the non-compete provision set forth in Section 6.25 hereof, Buyer hereby
grants to Seller a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid, royalty
free license under the Acquired Intellectual Property, to, make, have made,
use, sell, offer for sale and import any products.  The Acquired Intellectual
Property licensed to Seller in accordance with the foregoing may not be
sublicensed or transferred by Seller except in connection with the licensing or
transfer by Seller of substantial other Intellectual Property of Seller and
under substantially the same terms and condition as such other Intellectual
Property of Seller is licensed or transferred; provided, however, that such
sublicense or transfer may not grant to the sublicensee or transferee broader
rights than granted to Seller hereunder.  In addition, Seller shall not
transfer or sublicense any Trade Secrets constituting Transferred Intellectual
Property except pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement at least as protective
of such Trade Secrets as it is of Seller's own Trade Secrets and otherwise in
accordance with Section 6.31 hereof.

       6.16   Certain Software.

              (a)    Without limiting Section 6.15, in order to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to permit Buyer to operate the
Business substantially in the manner such Business was operated by the Seller,
Seller agrees to and hereby grants to Buyer a worldwide, perpetual,
nonexclusive, fully paid up royalty free license to use, distribute, copy and
make and own derivative works from the source code and documentation for all
software owned or licensable by any member of the Seller Group, and not part of
the Acquired Assets, and currently being used in the Business.  Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Gore to grant to Buyer a license
to the source code and documentation for the "Gore Software," including without
limitations





                                      -59-
<PAGE>   70
the "Works" and "WorkCell" programs and all tools and documentation relating
thereto (the "Gore Software"), the license for which shall be paid by Buyer,
with terms satisfactory to Buyer.  To the extent Seller is permitted to do so
without cost to Seller, Seller shall, at no charge by Seller to Buyer, for a
period of two years provide Buyer with all upgrades, enhancements and fixes to
the Gore Software made by or for Seller to the extent related to the Business.

              (b)    To permit Seller to continue its own operations
substantially in the manner they were performed prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer agrees to and hereby grants to Seller a worldwide, perpetual,
nonexclusive, royalty free license to use, distribute, copy and make derivative
works from the source code and documentation for all software transferred as
Acquired Assets as described in Exhibit A and currently used in Seller
operations, and to the extent the right to grant such license was acquired by
Buyer from Seller.

              (c)    All costs, if any, payable by Seller to third parties with
respect to third party software licenses to be transferred or subject to
sublicense for the benefit of Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or any Related
Agreement shall be paid by Buyer; provided, however, that Buyer may elect to
forego such transfer or sublicense, in which event Buyer shall not be obligated
to pay such costs with respect thereto.

       6.17   Access to Information.

              (a)    Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, Seller shall, and shall cause the
Seller Group to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants and other representatives of Buyer, reasonable access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Closing Date, to all
Acquired Assets, including Acquired Facilities, books, contracts, commitments,
records, officers, employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of
any member of the Seller Group and, during such period, it shall make available
to Buyer all information concerning the Business, the Joint Ventures, the
Acquired Assets, or Proceedings, or Claims or Losses relating thereto, as Buyer
may reasonably request ("Access Rights").  With respect to the Joint Ventures,
Seller shall request that the Joint Ventures provide Access Rights to Buyer;
provided, however, that Seller shall not be liable for the failure of any of
the Joint Ventures to afford Buyer such Access Rights.  Such Access Rights
shall include, without limitation, the performance by Buyer, at Buyer's
expense, of any inspections, testings, investigations, and groundwater and soil
sampling or other review of the physical condition of the Acquired Facilities
as may be deemed necessary by Buyer.  During the period of such access, Buyer
and its consultants or other representatives shall not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operation of the Business.  Upon request of Buyer, Seller
shall also use commercially reasonable efforts to request that the Joint
Ventures grant Access Rights to Buyer.

              (b)    Buyer shall take reasonable steps to avoid and minimize
any disruption of the Acquired Facilities through the exercise of its Access
Rights.  Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller harmless from and against any
and all loss, cost, claim or expense arising out of the exercise of its Access
Rights at the Acquired Facilities.  In the event Buyer performs an
environmental or





                                      -60-
<PAGE>   71
endangered species site assessment as part of the inspection of the Acquired
Facilities, Seller shall be afforded at least two (2) Business Days' prior
notice of, and the right to be present and/or collect split samples during any
activity on the Acquired Facilities in connection with such assessment.
Promptly after Buyer's receipt thereof, Buyer agrees to furnish Seller with a
copy of any analytical results and shall permit Seller to comment upon the
consultant's report prior to finalization and shall provide Seller with any
final report.

              (c)    No investigation by Buyer or its representatives shall
affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller set
forth in this Agreement.

       6.18   Tax Parameters; Price Allocation.  The valuation and allocation
of the purchase price and other consideration exchanged in connection with the
transactions described herein shall be as mutually agreed by Buyer and Seller
in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 1060 of the Code in
accordance with the provisions in Exhibit H (such valuation and allocation
being referred to herein as the "Price Allocation").  The Price Allocation
shall also apply for purposes of the asset transfers to Singapore Newco and
Italian Newco.  Exhibit H also sets forth certain parameters with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Tax Parameters").  Buyer and Seller
agree to negotiate in good faith in order to determine the Price Allocation as
soon as practicable.  If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the Price
Allocation, the dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 6.4(d) hereof and the provisions of this Section 6.18.  Each
party (and their respective Affiliates) hereto shall at its own expense adopt
and abide by such Price Allocation and Tax Parameters for purposes of all Tax
Returns filed by them and shall not take any position inconsistent therewith in
connection with any examination of any Tax Return, any refund claim, or any
judicial litigation proceeding but only if doing otherwise in such judicial
litigation proceeding would materially prejudice the other party, or otherwise
until there has been a final "determination" (within the meaning of Code
Section 1313(a)) or any other event which finally and conclusively establishes
the amount of any liability for Taxes.  In the event that the Price Allocation
is disputed by any Taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto of such dispute and the parties
hereto shall consult with each other concerning resolution of the dispute.

       6.19   Notices of Certain Events.  Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of
(i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent
of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Agency in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (iii) any Claims commenced or, to the knowledge of Seller,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Business or the Acquired Assets that, if pending on the date of this Agreement,
would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.1(l) or
that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

       6.20   Bulk Sales Waiver.  Buyer and Seller hereby waive compliance with

by this Agreement; provided,

<PAGE>   72
however, that Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer and its Affiliates harmless
from and against any Losses arising out of noncompliance with any such laws.

       6.21   Expenses.  Each party hereto agrees to bear its own expenses,
including any applicable broker's or finder's fee, in connection with the
negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and
its performance hereunder and thereunder, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, or in any of the Related Agreements.

       6.22   Transfer Taxes; Transfer and Recording Fees.

              (a)    Seller shall be solely responsible for and shall pay (or
cause to be paid) on or before the due date any and all Transfer Taxes.  Buyer
shall cooperate with Seller in connection with any Tax Returns related to
Seller's payment of such Taxes, and in executing customary documents in order
to attempt to establish exemptions from Texas sales Tax and other transaction
Taxes.

              (b)    Payment of all costs, expenses and fees arising or
incurred in connection with any claim for or contest of Transfer Taxes shall be
borne by Seller.  Upon receipt by Buyer of a refund of all or part of any claim
for which a party has made payment under this Section 6.22 and with respect to
which Buyer has received a payment from Seller, or Seller has received from
Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Seller, or Seller shall pay to Buyer, the amount of
the refund.

              (c)    Buyer shall be entitled to pay, or cause to be paid, any
Transfer Tax and seek reimbursement from Seller, plus interest, to the extent a
failure to pay would result in a Lien on the Acquired Assets or otherwise
adversely affect the Business.

       6.23   Shutdown Costs.  In connection with Seller's suspension of
operations at the Twinstar Facility subsequent to the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to terminate
such operations in a "recoverable to current operating condition," and will
consult with Buyer to achieve that goal and to limit the Shutdown Costs
associated therewith to those that are reasonably necessary.  In performing
such activities, Seller shall comply with all applicable Environmental
Requirements, Contracts, Laws, Permits and/or Approvals applicable to such
activities.  Subsequent to such suspension of operations and prior to the
Closing, Seller shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the
value of the Twinstar Facilities.  Buyer shall reimburse Seller at the Closing
for 50% of the Shutdown Costs actually incurred by Seller; provided, however,
that Seller delivers to Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior to Closing a
statement in reasonable detail summarizing the nature and amount of such
Shutdown Costs.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Buyer shall not be obligated to reimburse Seller for any Shutdown Costs unless
the Closing has occurred.

       6.24   Securities Act Compliance; Restrictions on Sale.  Seller
understands and acknowledges that the Securities issuable at the Closing, shall
be issued pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act from the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act, and at the time
of such issuance will not have been registered under the Securities Act or
other applicable state securities laws.  The availability of such exemption is
conditioned, in part, upon the representation of Seller, that the Securities
will not be sold or otherwise distributed except as expressly provided herein.

       6.25   Covenant Not to Compete.

              (a)    Seller covenants and agrees that for a period of three (3)
years following the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any Affiliates of Seller
(excluding any employee or pension fund or other similar Person acting in a
fiduciary capacity) shall, directly or indirectly, as principal, partner,
agent, employee, consultant, stockholder, or otherwise, anywhere in the world
(the "Territory"), engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture or sale
of Memory Products.  Seller also covenants and agrees that for a period of five
(5) years following the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of
Seller (excluding any employee or pension fund or other similar Person acting
in a fiduciary capacity) shall, directly or indirectly, as a principal,
partner, agent, employee, consultant, stockholder, or otherwise, anywhere in
the Territory, engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacture or sales of
Memory Products through a foundry or exercise any "have made" rights granted in
the Cross-License Agreement for the manufacture or sale of Memory Products;
provided, however, that Seller may fulfill its contractual obligations
effective as of the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Transition
Agreement, as amended to the date hereof.

              (b)    Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that compliance
with the covenant contained in this Section 6.25 is necessary to protect Buyer
and its Subsidiaries and that a breach of such covenant would result in
irreparable and continuing damage for which there would be no adequate remedy
at law.  Seller agrees that in the event of any breach of said covenant, Buyer
shall be entitled to injunctive relief and to such other and further relief as
is proper under the circumstances.  Seller agrees that this restriction on
competition shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants not-to-compete
for each year within the three-year and five-year periods of non-competition
and separate covenants not-to-compete for each state within the United States
and each country in the world.  If any court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine the foregoing covenant to be unenforceable with respect to the term
thereof or the scope of the subject matter or geography covered thereby, then
such covenant shall nonetheless be enforceable by such court against such other
party or upon such shorter term or within such lesser scope as may be
determined by the court to be reasonable and enforceable.

              (c)    In the event that Seller shall be in violation of the
aforementioned restrictive covenants, then the time limitation thereof shall be
extended for a period of time during which such breach or breaches shall occur.





                                      -63-
<PAGE>   74
              (d)    Seller covenants on behalf of itself and each member of
the Seller Group not to use, or to sell, assign or otherwise extend the
benefits to any Person from any Non-Assignable Contract in a manner which is
competitive with the Business as owned and operated by Buyer.

       Notwithstanding the foregoing:  (i) Seller or its Affiliates may acquire
a controlling interest in, or a majority of the assets of, any Person having
not more than 5% of its sales (based on its latest annual audited financial
statements) attributable to the manufacture or sale of Memory Products;
provided, however, that Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to use
commercially reasonable efforts to promptly divest itself of or shutdown that
portion of the operations of such Person engaged in the manufacture or sale of
Memory Products; (ii) Seller or its Affiliates may acquire up to 2% of the
outstanding capital stock or other ownership interest in any Person engaged
principally in the manufacture or sale of Memory Products having a class of
equity securities listed on any national or international securities exchange;
and (iii) Seller or its Affiliates may engage in the assembly, packaging and/or
sale of Memory Products for sale to customers solely for use in military and
aerospace applications.

       6.26   Collection of Accounts.  Seller agrees that, after the Closing,
it will promptly transfer to or deliver to Buyer any cash or other property
received directly or indirectly by Seller in respect of any accounts receivable
of the Business, constituting Acquired Assets, including any amounts receivable
as interest.

       6.27   Public Disclosure.  No party hereto shall issue any public
statement or communication regarding this Agreement, the subject matter of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except for such disclosures
as are required to comply with applicable law or the rules of any national
securities exchange, without the prior written approval of the other parties.
If any such disclosure is required by law or the rules of any national
securities exchange, the disclosing party agrees to give the nondisclosing
party prior notice and an opportunity to comment on the proposed disclosure.

       6.28   Assistance with Audit.  Following the Closing, each party will
provide the other party and their independent public accountants access to (and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their independent public
accountants to provide the other party and their independent public accountants
access to) such books, records, workpapers and data as may be reasonably
requested by such other party to allow such other party and their independent
public accountants to conduct an audit or review of the Business for such
periods as such other party may require for their preparation of the
Preliminary Balance Sheet, the Adjusted Balance Sheet and the Closing Balance
Sheet, as applicable, as well as for their financial reporting purposes,
including that required in connection with any registration statement or report
to be filed by Buyer with the SEC or other Governmental Agency.  The parties
mutually agree to reasonably assist each other and their independent
accountants in conducting any such audit or review.  The parties mutually agree
to use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their independent public
accountants to provide each other with any such consents of their independent
public accountants necessary for such party to satisfy such requirements with
the SEC under applicable accounting rules.  On and after the Closing Date,
Buyer





                                      -64-
<PAGE>   75
will afford to Seller and its agents reasonable access to the books of account,
financial and other reports, information, employees and auditors to the extent
the same primarily relate to periods prior to the Closing and which are
necessary for Seller in connection with any tax audit, investigation, inquiry
by a Governmental Agency (including with respect to government subsidies),
dispute, litigation or other similar matter relating to the Acquired Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities.  On and after the Closing Date, Seller will afford to
Buyer and its agents reasonable access to the books of account, financial and
other reports, information, employees and auditors to the extent the same
primarily relate to periods prior to the Closing and which are necessary for
Buyer in connection with any tax audit, investigation, inquiry by a
Governmental Agency (including with respect to government subsidies), dispute,
litigation or other similar matter relating to the Acquired Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities.

       6.29   Use of Proceeds.  Buyer shall use the U.S. $750 million received
from Seller at the Closing for general corporate purposes, including working
capital and capital expenditures (but excluding financing the purchase price of
any acquisitions or use in the business of Micron Electronics, Inc.).

       6.30   Maintenance of Trade Secrets.  Seller shall neither use nor
disclose to any Person, and shall otherwise maintain the confidentiality of,
all materials, information and things embodying or constituting Trade Secrets
that are Acquired Intellectual Property and Seller shall neither take, nor fail
to take, any action that would adversely affect Buyer's rights in, or the value
of, any of the Trade Secrets constituting Acquired Intellectual Property.

       6.31   Assignment of Contracts.

              (a)    For purposes of this Agreement, including Sections 2.1 and
2.2 hereof, "Transferred Contracts" shall mean each Contract to which Seller,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates is a party primarily related
to or primarily used in the Business (i) that was entered into in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices and not of a type required to
be listed in the Seller Disclosure Letter pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2
hereof, or (ii) listed on Schedule 6.31 to this Agreement to be prepared by
Buyer and delivered to Seller in accordance with this Section 6.31(a) (the
"Transferred Contract Schedule").  The Transferred Contract Schedule shall be
prepared by Buyer and delivered to Seller on or prior to the 45th day after the
date of this Agreement and upon delivery of the final version of such schedule,
such schedule shall become a part of this Agreement as if attached hereto as of
the date hereof.  In the event that the Transferred Contract Schedule includes
less than substantially all of the Contracts listed in the Seller Disclosure
Letter, other than Excluded Contracts, Seller may terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 11.1(g) hereof any time during the five day period
immediately following receipt of the final Transferred Contract Schedule.

              (b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
or any Related Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to
assign any Contract which is to be an Acquired Asset or any benefit arising
thereunder or resulting therefrom, if an attempted





                                      -65-
<PAGE>   76
assignment thereof, without the consent of a party thereto other than any
member of the Seller Group, would constitute a breach or other contravention
thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of Buyer, or its designees,
thereunder (a "Non-Assignable Contract").  Seller shall, and shall cause each
member of the Seller Group to, use prior to the Closing all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of the other Persons for the
assignment thereof to Buyer or its designees.  If such consent is not obtained
prior to the Closing, or if an attempted assignment thereof would be
ineffective or would adversely affect the rights thereunder so that Buyer would
not receive substantially all such rights, (x) Seller shall, and shall cause
each member of the Seller Group to, continue to use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the consent of the other Persons for the assignment thereof
to Buyer or its designees, and (y) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in a
mutually agreeable arrangement under which Buyer would obtain the benefits and
assume the obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including
subcontracting, sub-licensing or sub-leasing to Buyer, or under which Seller
would enforce for the benefit of Buyer, with Buyer assuming Seller's
obligations, any and all rights of Seller against a third party thereto.
Seller shall promptly pay to Buyer when received all monies received by Seller
in respect of such Non-Assignable Contracts or any benefit arising thereunder,
except to the extent the same represents an Excluded Asset.  To the extent the
benefits therefrom and obligations thereunder have been provided by alternative
arrangements as provided above, any such Non-Assignable Contract shall be
deemed an Acquired Asset, provided that Buyer shall not be responsible for any
Liabilities (i) arising out of a claim of breach of such Non-Assignable
Contract due to the establishment of the alternative arrangements, or (ii)
arising out of such Non-Assignable Contract as a result of Seller's action
without Buyer's approval in a manner inconsistent with the alternative
arrangements.

              (c)    In furtherance, and not in limitation of the foregoing
subsection (a), in the event that Seller is unable to obtain any required
consent to the transfer at Closing to the Buyer of any Non-Assignable Contract
and Seller and Buyer have failed to agree on alternate arrangements to an
assignment reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, then (i) Seller shall remain a
party to and shall continue to be bound by such Non-Assignable Contract, (ii)
Buyer shall pay, perform and discharge fully all of the obligations of Seller
thereunder from and after the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of such Non-Assignable Contract, (iii) Seller shall, without further
consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to Buyer promptly all monies,
rights and other consideration received in respect of such Non- Assignable
Contract on and after the Closing Date, and (iv) Seller shall, without further
consideration therefor, exercise and exploit its rights and options under such
Non-Assignable Contract in the manner and only to the extent directed by Buyer.
If and when any consent shall be obtained following the Closing Date with
respect to the transfer by Seller to Buyer of any such Non- Assignable Contract
or such Non-Assignable Contract shall otherwise become assignable following the
Closing Date, Seller shall promptly assign all of its rights and obligations
thereunder to Buyer, without further consideration therefor, and Buyer shall,
without further consideration therefor, assume such rights and obligations, to
the fullest extent permitted.  The existence of the provisions of this Section
6.31 shall not reduce or otherwise adversely affect any party's ability to
enforce any of its rights under this Agreement.

Taxes whensoever arising with respect to or relating to the Acquired Assets or
the Business that are attributable to any taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date and, in the case of a taxable period that includes, but does
not end on the Closing Date, the portion of such taxable period that ends on
the Closing Date, (ii) any and all Taxes of Seller, the Operating Group or
Subsidiaries or Affiliates thereof (other than Italian Newco and Singapore

relate, (iii) all Taxes arising out of Treasury Regulation Section  1.1502-6 or
any comparable provision of foreign, state, local or subnational Law, (iv) any
and all Taxes arising out of or constituting a breach of any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained in this Article VII or in Section 3.4, 6.1,

similar reduction or recapture of any Tax incentive or other Governmental

such Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of a Tax that is based on any of net
income, gross income, sales, premiums or gross receipts, the Tax that would be
due with respect to the Pre-Closing Period if such Pre-Closing Period were a
separate taxable period, except that exemptions, allowances, deductions or
credits, exclusive of the amount by which they are increased as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and which are calculated on an annual basis
(such as the deduction for depreciation or capital allowances) shall be
apportioned on a per diem basis.  Nothing herein shall be construed to exclude
Transfer Taxes from the meaning of Seller's Taxes.  Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Seller's Taxes and Transfer Taxes shall
constitute an Excluded Liability.

<PAGE>   80
              (b)    Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
affiliates and shall be responsible for and shall timely pay or cause to be
paid any and all Taxes (other than Seller's Taxes, Transfer Taxes, Excluded
Liabilities, or any other Liability Seller is responsible for or with respect
to which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer Operating Group in accordance
with this Agreement) with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business, that
are attributable to any taxable period commencing after the Closing Date and,
in the case of a taxable period that includes, but does not end on, the Closing
Date, the portion of such taxable period that begins on the day after the
Closing Date ("Buyer's Taxes").  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer's Taxes shall constitute an Assumed Liability.

Return which includes payments of Buyer's Taxes, Buyer shall promptly reimburse
Seller for such Buyer's Taxes when such Tax Return is filed.  Seller shall
timely provide to Buyer all information and documents within the possession of
Seller (or their auditors, advisors or Affiliates) and signatures and consents
necessary for Buyer to properly prepare and file the Tax Returns described in
the second preceding sentence or in connection with the determination of any
Tax liability or any audit, examination or proceeding.  Buyer shall timely
provide to Seller all information and documents within its possession or the
possession of its auditors, advisors or affiliates and signatures and consents
necessary for Seller properly to prepare and file the Tax Returns described in
the second preceding sentence or in connection with the determination of any
Tax liability or any audit, examination or proceeding.  Each party hereto shall
reasonably cooperate with the other (at their own expense) party to obtain
other information or documents necessary or appropriate to prepare and file Tax
Returns or elections or necessary or appropriate in connection with the
determination of any Tax liability or any audit, examination or proceeding.

       7.3    Tax Returns.

              (a)    Seller shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and
filed) on a timely basis all Tax Returns with respect to the Business and
Acquired Assets ("Acquired Assets Tax Returns") for all taxable periods ending
on or before the Closing Date and shall pay directly when due or promptly
reimburse Buyer as provided hereunder, and shall indemnify and hold Buyer
harmless against any and all Seller's Taxes.  Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and the provisions of
Section 6.18 hereof.  In the event of a conflict, the provision of Section 6.18
shall control.

              (b)    Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and
filed) on a timely basis all Acquired Assets Tax Returns for periods ending

of Buyer.  Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause any such refunds or credits
due Seller pursuant to this section to be promptly forwarded to Seller after
receipt or realization thereof by Buyer, and Seller shall promptly forward (or
cause to be forwarded) to Buyer any refunds or credits due to Buyer pursuant to
this section after receipt or realization thereof by Seller.

       7.5    Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements.  Seller hereby agrees and
covenants that there are and will be no obligations relating to the Acquired
Assets pursuant to any Tax sharing agreement or any similar arrangement in
effect at any time before or on the Closing Date, and any further obligations
that might otherwise have existed thereunder shall be extinguished as of the
Closing Date.

       7.6    Tax Elections.  Seller shall make and/or cooperate (at its own
expense) in making such "check-the-box" and any corresponding state or local
Tax election as Buyer shall request.  Without in any way limiting the
foregoing, Buyer hereby agrees to make and Seller shall cooperate in the making
of an election under Code Section 338(a) and (g) for Italian Newco and
Singapore Newco.

       7.7    Conduct of Audits and Other Procedural Matters.

              (a)    Each party shall, at its own expense, control any audit or
examination by any Taxing authority, and have the right to initiate any claim
for refund or amended return, and contest, resolve and defend against any
assessment, notice of deficiency or other adjustment or proposed adjustment of
Taxes ("Tax Proceedings") for any taxable period for which that party is
obligated to file Acquired Assets Tax Returns.

              (b)    Each party shall promptly forward to the other in
accordance with Section 12.9 all written notifications and other written
communications from any Taxing authority received by such party or its
affiliates relating to any liability for Taxes for any taxable period for which
such other party or any of its affiliates is charged with payment or
indemnification responsibility under this Agreement and each indemnifying party
shall promptly notify, and consult with, each indemnified party as to any
action it proposes to take with respect to any liability for Taxes for which it
is required to indemnify another party or which may affect the Taxes of another
party and shall not enter into any closing agreement or final settlement with
any Taxing authority with respect to any such liability without the written
consent of the indemnified or affected parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

              (c)    In the case of any Proceedings relating to any Straddle
Period, Buyer shall control such Tax Proceedings and shall consult in good
faith with Seller as to the conduct of such Tax Proceedings.  Seller shall
reimburse Buyer for such portion of the costs, including legal costs, of
conducting such Tax Proceedings as is represented by the portion of the Tax
with respect to such Straddle Period for which Seller is liable pursuant to
this Agreement; provided, however, that Seller may instead elect to pay or
cause to be paid to Buyer the allocable amount of the applicable Taxes that
constitute Seller's Taxes (which amount shall not be less than the portion
allocable to Seller





                                      -71-
<PAGE>   82
hereunder of the Tax as asserted by the applicable Taxing authority) including
any interest, penalties, or additions thereto asserted in such proceeding.
Each party shall, at the expense of the requesting party, execute or cause to
be executed any powers of attorney or other documents reasonably requested by
such requesting party to enable it to take any and all actions such party
reasonably requests with respect to any Tax Proceedings which the requesting
party controls.

              (d)    The failure by a party to provide timely notice under this
subsection shall not relieve the other party from its obligations under this
Section 7.7 with respect to the subject matter of any notification not timely
forwarded, unless and to the extent that the other party can demonstrate with
clear and convincing evidence that the other party has suffered an economic
detriment because of such failure to provide notification in a timely fashion.

       7.8    Assistance and Cooperation.  Each of Seller and Buyer (and their
respective Affiliates) shall at their own expense:

              (a)    assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which
such other party is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with
this Article VII;

              (b)    cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with Taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns relating to the
Acquired Assets;

              (c)    make available to the other and to any Taxing authority as
reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes
concerning the Acquired Assets;

              (d)    make available to the other and to any Taxing authority as
reasonably requested employees and independent auditors to provide explanations
and additional information relating to Taxes concerning the Acquired Assets;

              (e)    provide timely notice to the other in writing of any
pending or threatened Tax audits, assessments or Tax Proceedings with respect
to the Acquired Assets for taxable periods for which the other may have a
liability under this Article VII;

              (f)    furnish the other with copies of all correspondence
received from any Taxing authority in connection with any Tax audit or Tax
Proceedings with respect to any taxable period for which the other may have a
liability under this Article VII; and

              (g)    retain any books and records that could reasonably be
expected to be necessary or useful in connection with Buyer's or Seller's
preparation, as the case may be, of any Tax Return, or for any audit,
examination, or Proceeding relating to Taxes.  Such books and records shall be
retained until the expiration of one (1) year after the applicable statute of
limitations (including extensions thereof); provided, however, that in the
event of an audit, examination, investigation or Proceeding has been instituted
prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (or in





                                      -72-
<PAGE>   83
the event of any claim under this Agreement), the books and records shall be
retained until there is a final determination thereof (and the time for any
appeal has expired).

       7.9    Survival.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the provisions of this Article VII shall survive for the full period
of all statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof).


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                EMPLOYEE MATTERS

       8.1    Transfer of Employment.

              (a)    As of the Closing Date, Italian Operating Company shall
transfer to Italian Newco the employment of all Italian Operating Company
employees employed in the Business as of the Closing Date who have neither
tendered nor received notice of their termination of employment with Italian
Operating Company as of such date, on terms substantially comparable in the
aggregate to their terms of employment as of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, Italian Operating Company employees employed in the
Business who are on maternity, disability or other employer-approved leave of
absence as of the Closing Date shall only have their employment transferred as
of the date, if any, upon which they return to work at Buyer's facility.  From
the Closing Date until the earlier to occur of (x) completion of the Italian
government's final audit relating to the 1989 Program Contract, or (y) eighteen
(18) months after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause employment levels in
Italian Newco to remain substantially equivalent to the level of employment as
of the Closing Date; provided, however, that Italian Newco shall be entitled to
terminate Italian Newco employees for good reason and shall be allowed to
reduce employment levels through Italian Newco employee attrition; provided,
further, that in all events Buyer shall cause Italian Newco to maintain levels
of employment consistent with the minimum requirements under the 1989 Program
Contract (i.e. 1,270 employees) during such period.  Except with respect to the
preceding sentence, Buyer and, after the Closing Date, Italian Newco, shall not
be required to undertake any liability or obligation or to pay any additional
consideration in order to obtain Italian Governmental Approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

              (b)    On the Closing Date, Singapore Operating Company shall
transfer to Singapore Newco the employment of all Singapore Operating Company
employees employed in the Business as of the Closing Date who have neither
tendered nor received notice of their termination of employment with Singapore
Operating Company as of such date, on terms substantially comparable in the
aggregate to their terms of employment as of the Closing Date.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing sentence, Singapore Operating Company employees employed in the
Business who are on maternity, disability or other employer-approved leave of
absence as of the Closing Date shall only have their employment transferred as
of the date, if any, upon which they return to work at Buyer's facility.





                                      -73-
<PAGE>   84
              Notwithstanding this Section 8.1(b), the transfer of the
employment of the employees of Singapore Operating Company who are "employees"
as defined in the Employment Act of the Republic of Singapore (the "Employment
Act") shall be governed by Section 18A of the Employment Act.  Buyer shall
cause Singapore Newco and Seller shall cause Singapore Operating Company to
each comply with their respective obligations under Section 18A.

              (c)    Commencing not later than thirty (30) days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall, subject to the exceptions set forth in Section
8.1(e) hereof, make written offers of employment to substantially all the
Domestic Employees and Foreign Employees (other than Excluded Employees, those
employees referenced in Sections 8.1(a) and (b) above and employees terminated
pursuant to the suspension of operations at Twinstar as contemplated by Section
6.23) who have neither tendered nor received notice of their termination of
employment with Seller as of such date, and may make offers of employment (i)
for up to forty (40) employees employed in Seller's test equipment group, at
Buyer's discretion (which test equipment group employees shall be mutually
agreed upon in good faith by Seller and Buyer) and (ii) to Seller's employees
located at, or whose employment primarily relates to, Seller's Memory
Technology Center, in each case on terms substantially comparable in the
aggregate to the terms on which Buyer employs its employees similarly situated
as of the date of the offer; provided, however, that such offers shall
automatically terminate if not accepted in writing by the offerees prior to the
Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any such employees who
are on maternity, disability, FMLA or other employer-approved leave of absence
as of the Closing Date shall only commence employment with Buyer upon the date,
if any, upon which they return to work.  Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer with the delivery of such written offers of
employment.

              (d)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Buyer will not be required to make an offer of employment, and Buyer shall not
cause Italian Newco or Singapore Newco to make offers of employment, to any
employee employed in the Business whom Buyer and Seller mutually agree in
writing prior to the Closing Date will be retained or relocated by Seller.

              (e)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Buyer will not be required to make an offer of employment to any employee
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) hereof, up to a maximum of 200 employees Buyer would
otherwise be required to make an offer to pursuant to Section 8.1(c) hereof,
whom it designates in writing to Seller not more than seventy-five (75) days
following the execution of this Agreement (the "Designated Employees").
Moreover, to the extent that Buyer, in its discretion, offers employment to
fewer than forty (40) employees employed in Seller's test equipment group
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) hereof, the 200 employee limit in the preceding
sentence shall be reduced.  For example, if Buyer, in its discretion, offers
employment to only thirty (30) employees in Seller's test equipment group
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) hereof, the 200 employee limit in the first sentence
of this Section 8.1(e) shall be reduced to 190 employees.  Buyer agrees to
reimburse Seller for fifty percent of the termination costs pursuant to any
written termination or severance plan approved by Seller, in place and
communicated to employees generally, prior to June 1, 1998 and not put in place
in anticipation of the transactions contemplated





                                      -74-
<PAGE>   85
hereby, arising from the termination of Designated Employees (other than
Twinstar employees) who are terminated by Seller pursuant to Section 8.1 (e) of
this Agreement.

              (f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Buyer will not be required to make an offer of employment to any terminated
Twinstar employee.  Buyer's failure to offer employment pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall not count against the 200 employee limit specified in
Section 8.1(e) above.  Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller, in accordance with
Section 6.23 hereof, for fifty percent of the Shutdown Costs.

              (g)    Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Buyer, Italian Newco or Singapore Newco, as appropriate, in hiring all
employees offered employment by Buyer, or transferring employment to Italian
Newco or Singapore Newco pursuant to this Section 8.1.

              (h)    Prior to the Closing Date, designated employees of Buyer
shall be permitted, on a commercially reasonable basis, subject to prior
written notice to Seller, to meet with any Domestic Employee or Foreign
Employee (other than employees of Italian Operating Company or Singapore
Operating Company) for purposes of selecting the Domestic Employees or Foreign
Employees to whom Buyer will not make an offer of employment pursuant to
Section 8.1(e).

              (i)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
Buyer shall not be required to employ any Domestic Employee or Foreign Employee
to whom an offer of employment was made by Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1(c) and
accepted by such Domestic Employee or Foreign Employee on the Closing Date when
such employment would violate the terms of such employee's visa or immigration
law.  In such event, Buyer agrees to employ such employee at such time, if any,
as such visa or immigration law restriction no longer applies.

       8.2    Coverage Under Employee Benefit Plans.

              (a)    On the Closing Date, and thereafter while employed by
Italian Newco or Singapore Newco, each Transferred Business Employee employed
by Italian Newco or Singapore Newco ("Italian and Singapore Transferred
Business Employees") shall continue to be covered by the Employee Benefit Plans
under which they were covered immediately prior to the Closing Date that were
established, maintained and sponsored solely at the Italian and Singapore
Operating Company levels to the extent permitted by law and contract.  On and
after the Closing Date, Italian and Singapore Transferred Business Employees
shall not be covered by Seller's Employee Benefit Plans, including, without
limitation, Seller's profit-sharing plan.  Seller agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Italian Operating Company and Singapore Operating
Company to transfer the Employee Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing
Date to Italian Newco and Singapore Newco, as appropriate, under which Italian
and Singapore Transferred Business Employees were covered (other than Seller's
Employee Benefit Plans).

              (b)    On the Closing Date, and thereafter while employed by the
Buyer, each Transferred Business Employee (who is a Domestic Employee and who
is not an Italian and





                                      -75-
<PAGE>   86
Singapore Transferred Business Employees) ("Buyer Transferred Business
Employees") shall cease to be covered under Seller's Employee Benefit Plans and
instead shall become covered under Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans; provided,
however, that with respect to Transferred Business Employees located in Texas
("Texas Transferred Business Employees"), Buyer may elect in writing to Seller,
but not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date (the "Buyer COBRA
Election"), not to cover such employees under Buyer's group health and dental
plans and instead require Seller to offer COBRA continuation coverage to the
Texas Transferred Business Employees, with Buyer subsidizing the employees'
cost of COBRA coverage of the Texas Transferred Business Employees who elect to
receive COBRA coverage in the same dollar amount as Buyer subsidizes the
premium payments of Buyer's similarly situated U.S. employees under Buyer's
group health and dental plans.  In the event Buyer elects to use the Buyer
COBRA Election, Buyer agrees to cover such Texas Transferred Business Employees
as are still employed by Buyer under Buyer's group health and dental plans no
later than January 1, 2000.  Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist Buyer in the transition of Buyer Transferred Business
Employees to coverage under Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans including, at
Buyer's request, allowing Buyer to hold, on a commercially reasonable basis,
Employee Benefit Plan open enrollment meetings with potential Transferred
Business Employees at least thirty (30) days prior to the Target Closing Date
on Seller's premises.

              (c)    At Buyer's written request prior to the Closing Date,
Seller agrees to cause Texins' Association to extend membership privileges to
Texas Transferred Business Employees for such period of time (up to a maximum
of one (1) year following the Closing Date or until Texins' Association ceases
to offer recreation facilities to Seller's employees, whichever is earlier) as
is specified in writing by Buyer; provided, however, that Seller shall not
subsidize the Texins' Association membership costs of Texas Transferred
Business Employees on and after the Closing Date.

              (d)    Seller shall provide or cause to be provided to
Transferred Business Employees all notices required to be provided under the
Law, including, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") in connection with the termination of
U.S.-based Transferred Business Employees' coverage under Seller's Employee
Benefit Plans.

       8.3    General Matters.

              (a)    Buyer, Italian Newco and Singapore Newco, as appropriate,
shall credit each Transferred Business Employee with all service with Seller
and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date and with all amounts paid to each
such Transferred Business Employee prior to the Closing Date to the extent that
service or pay is relevant under any Employee Benefit Plan of Buyer, Italian
Newco or Singapore Newco for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, vesting and benefit accrual.  Buyer shall also provide Transferred
Business Employees with credit under Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans for
deductible and co-payment amounts made by Transferred Business Employees under
Seller's Employee Benefit Plans prior to the Closing Date in the plan years in
which the Closing Date occurs.  Seller agrees to provide deductible and
co-payment information with





                                      -76-
<PAGE>   87
respect to the Transferred Business Employees as soon as is practicable
following the Closing Date to effectuate such crediting of deductibles and
co-payment amounts.  Seller agrees to provide Buyer with service commencement
date and prior compensation information with respect to each potential
Transferred Business Employee as soon as practicable after the date upon which
this Agreement is executed.

              (b)    Commencing with the date upon which this Agreement is
executed, Seller and Buyer agree to cooperate fully with respect to the
employment-related actions which are necessary or reasonably desirable to
accomplish the transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, including
the provision of records and information as each may reasonably request
(including job titles, short and long-term disability coverage, life insurance
coverage, operator certification and workers' compensation records and
information) and the making of all appropriate filings under the Law.

       8.4    Employee Tax Withholding and Reporting.  With respect to
Transferred Business Employees who are required to be furnished a Form W-2 for
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, Buyer and Seller agree to
follow the "standard procedure" set forth in Revenue Procedure 96-60 with
respect to discharging their respective income and employment tax withholding
and reporting obligations with respect to such employees.

       8.5    Other Employment Matters.

              (a)    Prior to the Closing Date, or as promptly as practicable
thereafter, Seller or a Subsidiary of Seller, as appropriate, shall pay to the
Transferred Business Employees all salary, overtime, bonuses, severance and
commissions and other remuneration earned, accrued and payable for all periods
up to the Closing Date; provided, however, that paid time off accruals shall
not be paid out by Seller or Twinstar (but only with the written consent of
Twinstar Business Employees) at the Closing Date, but instead shall be credited
to each Transferred Business Employee by Buyer.

              (b)    Seller or its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, shall comply
with all notice and other provisions of applicable Laws, including (without
limitation) the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the "Warn
Act") and COBRA.  Seller shall retain all liability for salary, bonuses,
commissions and benefits due Domestic Employees and Foreign Employees and
related Taxes of the Seller Group for periods after the date of such notice of
termination as well as for any obligations under the Warn Act and for providing
continuation coverage under COBRA or any applicable similar Laws.

              (c)    Seller agrees to permit Transferred Business Employees who
are participants in Seller's (or Twinstar's) cafeteria (Code Section 125) plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date to continue participation in such plans
through the end of the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (the
"Transition Plan Year").  Such participation shall include the right of such
Transferred Business Employees to receive reimbursements pursuant to the
medical expense reimbursement component of Seller's cafeteria plan for all
qualifying expenses incurred in the Transition Plan Year,





                                      -77-
<PAGE>   88
including after the Closing Date, up to the annual election amount made by each
such participant with respect to the Transition Plan Year.  Such Transferred
Business Employees shall not be required to make any additional salary or wage
deferrals or other payments to Seller's cafeteria plan other than regularly
scheduled salary or wage deferrals made while on Seller's payroll.

              (d)    Seller, Italian Operating Company and Singapore Operating
Company agree, that with respect to any Transferred Business Employee whom had
commenced attending an educational course prior to the Closing Date that would
have been eligible for coverage pursuant to the education expense reimbursement
plans of Seller, Italian Operating Company or Singapore Operating Company,
Seller shall continue to cover such Transferred Business Employees under such
plans and provide benefits thereunder with respect to such courses pursuant to
the terms and conditions of such plans as if such employees had remained
employed by Seller, Italian Operating Company or Singapore Operating Company,
as appropriate.

       10.4   Buyer's Agreement to Indemnify.

              (a)    Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article X,
Buyer agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, Seller and each member of

<PAGE>   93
              (c)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
10.4(a) and (b) above, in no event shall Seller Indemnified Claims arising
under Section 10.4(a)(i) be subject to the provision of Section 10.4(b).

       10.5   Notice of Claims; Contest of Claims.  If any indemnified party
has paid or properly accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay
or accrue an Indemnified Claim, such indemnified party shall so notify the
indemnifying party; provided, however, that its failure to do so shall not
relieve the indemnified party's obligations except to the extent of any
material prejudice caused thereby.  The notice shall describe such an
Indemnified Claim, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of computation
thereof, all with reasonable particularity and shall contain a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such an Indemnified Claim
shall have been incurred, and, in the case of an action or suit by a third
party, shall include a copy of all documents received by the indemnified party
in connection therewith and any other information known to the indemnified
party with respect to such action or suit or the basis therefor.  Such notice
shall be given promptly after the indemnified party becomes aware of each such
an Indemnified Claim, action or suit.  The indemnifying party shall, within
thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice of an Indemnified Claim (i) pay
or cause to be paid to the indemnified party the amount of an Indemnified Claim
specified in such notice which the indemnifying party does not contest, or (ii)
notify the indemnified party if it wishes to contest the existence or amount of
part or all of such an Indemnified Claim stating with particularity the basis
upon which it contests the existence or amount thereof.  The indemnifying party
shall, within thirty (30) days after receipt of each notice with respect to an
action or suit demanding indemnification of a suit by a third party, undertake
to defend such action.  If the indemnifying party fails to so undertake the
defense in a reasonable manner, the indemnified party shall have the right to
defend, contest, settle or compromise such action or suit, and the indemnifying
party shall, upon request from such indemnified party, promptly pay to such
indemnified party in accordance with the other terms of this Article X, the
amount of any Loss resulting from its liability to the third party claimant.
In any action or suit by a third party limited to a claim for money damages,
the indemnifying party shall have the right to undertake, conduct and control,
through counsel (reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party) and at the
sole expense of such indemnifying party, the conduct and settlement of such
action or suit, and such indemnified party shall cooperate with such
indemnifying party in connection therewith; provided, however, that, the
indemnifying party may not, in the defense or prosecution of any such action or
suit, except with the prior written consent of the indemnified party, consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement (i) which does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving to such indemnified party
by the third party of a full and final release from all liability in respect of
such action or suit or (ii) which shall limit, restrict or otherwise affect the
indemnified party to carry on or conduct its business (then or in the future),
or require any payment to be made by the indemnified party, or limit, restrict,
or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which the indemnified party carries
on or conducts its businesses (then or in the future).

       10.6   Treatment of Indemnities.  Any indemnity payments made pursuant
to this Agreement shall be treated for income tax purposes as an adjustment of
the purchase price to the extent permitted by Law.  If applicable, the amount
an indemnifying party shall pay to the indemnified party





                                      -83-
<PAGE>   94
with respect to an obligation for indemnification under this Article X shall be
an amount which equals the amount of such obligation of the indemnifying party,
after giving effect to any and all Taxes imposed on the indemnified party on
the receipt or accrual of such indemnification as a result of a Taxing
authority not treating such amount as an adjustment to the purchase price.

       10.7   Risk of Loss.  Risk of loss with regard to any of the Acquired
Assets shall be on Seller until the Closing.  Risk of loss of the Excluded
Assets shall remain with Seller.

       10.8   Indemnity Payments.  All indemnity payments under this Agreement
shall be payable in United States dollars.  If any Indemnified Claims are
incurred in a currency other than United States dollars, then the United States
dollar amount thereof shall be calculated as follows: if any Indemnified Claims
are incurred as a result of an event occurring on a determinable date, the
amount of Indemnified Claims shall be deemed to be the amount of United States
dollars required to purchase the amount of such other currency on the date of
such event (or, if such date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding
Business Day) from Bank of America in San Francisco, and (z) in the case of any
other Indemnified Claims, an amount equal to the amount of United States
dollars that would have been necessary for the indemnified party to purchase
the foreign currency necessary to pay such Indemnified Claims as they were
incurred.

       10.9   Seller's Duty to Complete Remedial Activities.

              (a)    Subject to Section 10.9(d), Seller acknowledges that its
obligation to provide indemnification pursuant to Section 10.2 may result in a
duty to promptly and diligently undertake and perform, upon demand by certain
members of the Indemnified Buyer Group, any Remedial Activities covered by the
indemnification obligation and required by applicable Environmental
Requirements and good business practices customarily adhered to by major U.S.
corporations doing business in the countries in which the Acquired Facilities
are located, and that such Remedial Activities may appropriately include
Remedial Activities to prevent Contamination and other potential property
damage and bodily injury, which may be caused thereby, migration to date,
future releases, leaks, spills and emission and/or as well as Remedial
Activities to remove, remediate, and eliminate existing Contamination giving
rise to Seller's indemnification obligations and other harmful Hazardous
Material conditions giving rise to Seller's indemnification obligations.  In
this regard, Seller specifically agrees to promptly, following written demand,
commence and thereafter diligently complete all such Remedial Activities giving
rise to Seller's indemnification obligations within a reasonable time, and in
any event, within the time permitted by applicable Environmental Requirements.
Seller acknowledges that monetary damages are not adequate to compensate the
Indemnified Buyer Group for Seller's failure to promptly undertake and complete
such Remedial Activities giving rise to Seller's indemnification obligations
and, accordingly, Seller acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to perform
such Remedial Activities may be specifically enforced by a suit brought in the
State of Delaware for all Remedial Activities required of Seller hereunder,
without regard to the location (whether within or without the U.S.) where the
Remedial Activities must actually be performed.





                                      -84-
<PAGE>   95
              (b)    Subject to Section 10.9(d), without limiting other rights
and remedies hereunder, the Indemnified Buyer Group, and each of them, who is
an owner or occupant of an Acquired Facility at which Remedial Activities which
Seller is required by this Agreement to perform will be performed (the
"Facility Indemnitees"), at their election, may elect to either: (i) perform
(or cause their designee to perform) such Remedial Activities with funds
provided by Seller, or (ii) require that Seller, at their sole cost, perform
such Remedial Activities.  If a Facility Indemnitee elects to so perform the
Remedial Activities (or to cause a designee to perform the Remedial Activities)
as permitted above, then within forty-five (45) days following delivery of
written demand to Seller, Seller shall pay to such the Facility Indemnitee the
costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the Facility Indemnitee with respect
to such Remedial Activities, with interest thereon (if not paid within such
time) at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) per annum from the date of the
expenditure until paid, if such sums are not paid within forty-five (45) days
following submission to Seller of the demand and reasonable documentation of
the amount owing.  In no event, however, shall the principal sums payable by
Seller to the Facility Indemnitee pursuant to this subparagraph exceed the sums
that reasonably would have been incurred by Seller had Seller been the party
performing such Remedial Activities.  In either event, upon demand, Seller
shall make such applications, take such actions and execute such documents as
may be required to make a member of Seller the "generator," responsible for any
Hazardous Material waste created by the performance of such Remedial Activity.

              (c)    Subject to Section 10.9(d), Seller shall promptly and
diligently undertake and complete Remedial Activity required to be performed by
Seller under this Agreement in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance
with this Agreement and all applicable Environmental Requirements and other
Laws.  All such Remedial Activities shall be performed only after obtaining the
Facility Indemnitees' prior written approval (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of all material matters relating to said activity,
including, without limitation, (i) the identity of all environmental
consultants, contractors and other Persons performing the work, (ii) the plans
and specifications for the work, (iii) the time and manner for the performance
of the work, (iv) the precautions to be undertaken to protect the site where
the work will be performed, and the other activities being conducted thereon,
from damage or unreasonable interference, (v) the existence of appropriate
warranties, bonds and insurance with respect to the work and the contractors
performing the work, (vi) the source of payment for the work, (vii) the choice
of any treatment system, pre-treatment system or other major installations and
technologies that will be utilized, and (viii) the cleanup goals and other
major condition that must be met before such work is deemed complete.  During
the conduct of a Remedial Activity, Seller shall give the Buyer and any
Facility Indemnitees at least three (3) days prior written notice of all
material meetings and conferences between Seller and/or its Agents on the one
hand and any Governmental Agency or any third party claimant for such work, on
the other hand, and shall permit the Buyer and the Facility Indemnitee(s) (or
their respective designee(s)) to participate in all such meetings and
conferences.  No Seller Group member, or anyone under their control shall
deliver any report, sampling results, remedial investigation, feasibility
study, recommendations, correspondence (other than purely ministerial
correspondence) or other documents or proposals concerning an Acquired Facility
to any such Governmental Agency or third party with respect to Remedial
Activity required by this Agreement,





                                      -85-
<PAGE>   96
without the consent of Buyer and any relevant Facility Indemnitees, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and the Seller Group
shall promptly give Buyer and such Facility Indemnitee(s) copies of all plans,
specifications, contracts, reports, warranties, and other writings prepared in
connection with any Remedial Activity required of the Seller Group by this
Agreement.

              (d)    Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 10.9 to
the contrary, the foregoing provisions regarding the performance and completion
of certain Remedial Activities shall apply only to Remedial Activities to be
conducted at Acquired Facilities designated in Section 1.5 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter as "primary facilities" and shall not apply to the other
Acquired Facilities; provided, however, that such limitation of the rights and
obligations of the parties pursuant to this sentence shall not modify the
parties' rights and obligations with respect to Buyer Indemnified Claims or
Seller Indemnified Claims under any other provision of this Agreement.

       10.10  Seller's Duty With Respect to Intellectual Property.  If, at any
time prior to the third anniversary of the Closing any Person brings or
threatens to bring, any claim or action against Buyer or any of its Affiliates
or any successor to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, alleging that the conduct
of, or any product made or sold by, the Business infringes or misappropriates
the Intellectual Property of such Person and such conduct or product is
substantially the same as the conduct or products, as the case may be, of the
Business prior to the Closing, then regardless of whether such claim would be
subject to any indemnity under this Article X, Seller shall, at Seller's
expense, cooperate in a reasonable manner with, and assist, Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in the defense of such claim or action, including by making
available to Buyer or any of its Affiliates (any documents, materials or
information relevant to Buyer's) or any of its Affiliates' defense of such
action, claim or potential claim; provided, however, that Seller shall not have
any obligation to provide information covered by attorney-client privilege.

       10.11  Waivers and Survival.  It is expressly acknowledged by each
member of the Seller Group and Buyer that the obligations of the parties under
Sections 10.2 and 10.4 are independent of all other promises made by the
parties in this Agreement or otherwise and are intended to allocate risk of
loss with respect to the matters covered by such provisions solely to the
indemnitors therein identified, without regard to the conduct of any person or
any other fact or circumstance.  Therefore the parties further agree that the
acts and omissions of any indemnitee identified in Section 10.2 or 10.4 or any
other Person (whether active, passive, negligent, wrongful, in violation of
this Agreement or any other agreement) shall not impair the right of the
indemnitees benefitted by said Sections to enforce the obligations of the
indemnitors thereunder.  The obligations and rights of said indemnitees are in
addition to, independent from, and severable from the rights and obligations of
the parties under this Agreement and shall survive, notwithstanding the
termination, expiration or breach of this Agreement, any Related Agreement, or
any other Contract between any of the parties hereto and notwithstanding any
other act or omission of any Person, whether or not such acts are in violation
of the express provisions of this Agreement.  The provisions of this Article X
shall survive the Closing and any subsequent sale, transfer, assignment, or
hypothecation of any Acquired Asset, Newco Asset, Joint Venture Asset or any
interest in an indemnitee to any Person.

       11.2   Effect of Termination.  In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either Buyer or Seller as provided in Section 11.1, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and there shall be no Liability or obligation on
the part of any party hereto or any of its respective Affiliates, officers,
directors or shareholders except to the extent that such termination results

representations or warranties, or of any of its covenants or agreements, in
each case, as set forth in this Agreement.

       11.3   Further Provisions.  Termination by either party in accordance

                                 MISCELLANEOUS

       12.1   Further Assurances.  From time to time hereafter, Buyer and
Seller shall execute and deliver such other instruments of transfer and

in connection with effecting or carrying out the provisions of this Agreement.

       12.2   Specific Performance.  Each of the parties hereto acknowledges

respect to, any such or any other covenant, obligations, condition or agreement

                        STANDSTILL AND RELATED COVENANTS

       2.1    TI Ownership of Micron Securities.  On the date hereof, and
without giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition
Agreement, neither TI nor any Affiliate of TI beneficially owns any Voting
Securities of Micron (excluding any officers and directors of TI and any
employee benefit or pension plan of TI).

       2.2    Standstill Provisions.  TI shall not acquire, directly or
indirectly, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate of TI (excluding any
officers and directors of TI and any employee benefit or pension plan of TI) to
acquire, directly or indirectly (through market purchases or otherwise), record
or beneficial ownership of any Voting Securities of Micron without the prior
written consent of the Board of Directors of Micron; provided, however, that
the prior written consent of the Board of Directors of Micron shall not be
required for the acquisition of any Voting Securities of Micron pursuant to the
conversion of any of the 2005 Convertible Notes or resulting from a stock
split, stock dividend or similar recapitalization by Micron.  Nothing contained
in this Section 2.2 shall adversely affect any right of TI to acquire record or
beneficial ownership of Voting Securities of Micron pursuant to any rights plan
instituted by Micron.

       2.3    Voting.  Unless the Board of Directors of Micron otherwise
consents in writing in advance, TI shall take such action (and shall cause each
Affiliate of TI that beneficially owns Voting Securities of Micron to take such
action) as may be required so that all Voting Securities of Micron beneficially
owned by TI (or any such Affiliate of TI) from time to time are voted on all
matters to be voted on by holders of Voting Securities of Micron in the same
proportion (for, against and abstain, with lost, damaged or disfigured ballots
counting as abstentions to the extent that they cannot be counted as for or
against under applicable law) as the votes cast by the other holders of Voting
Securities of Micron with respect to such matters; provided, however, that all
Voting Securities of Micron beneficially owned by TI (or any Affiliate of TI)
from time to time may be voted as TI (or any such Affiliate of TI) determines
in its sole discretion on any matter presented to the holders of Voting
Securities of Micron (by any Person other than TI, any Affiliate of TI or an
"ASSOCIATE" of any of them, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the
Exchange Act), to approve (i) any merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving Micron, (ii) any sale of all or substantially all of the
assets of Micron, (iii) any issuance of equity or equity-linked securities of
Micron requiring stockholder approval pursuant to applicable stock exchange
rules; provided, however, that neither TI nor any Affiliate of TI shall be
entitled to vote on any matter set forth in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) hereof
that constitutes, involves or is part of, a TI Conflict of Interest
Transaction.  TI (or any Affiliate of TI), as the holder of Voting Securities
of Micron, shall use its best efforts to be present, in person or by proxy, at
all meetings of the stockholders of Micron so that all Voting Securities of
Micron beneficially owned by TI (or such Affiliate of TI) from time to time may
be counted for the purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at such
meetings.  The foregoing provision shall also apply to the execution by TI of
any written consent in lieu of a meeting of holders of Voting Securities of
Micron or any class thereof.

       2.4    Voting Trust.  TI shall not, and shall not cause or permit any
Affiliate of TI to, deposit any  Voting Securities of Micron in a voting trust
or, except as otherwise provided herein, subject any Voting Securities of
Micron to any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting of such
Voting Securities of Micron.

       2.5    Solicitation of Proxies.  Without the prior written consent of
the Board of Directors of Micron, TI shall not, and shall not cause or permit
any Affiliate of TI to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, propose or
otherwise solicit Micron stockholders for the approval of one or more
stockholder proposals with respect to Micron or induce or attempt to induce any
other Person to initiate any stockholder proposal, (ii) make, or in any way
participate in, any "SOLICITATION" of "PROXIES" (as such terms are defined or
used in Regulation 14a-1 under the Exchange Act) with respect to any Voting
Securities of Micron, or become a "PARTICIPANT" in any "ELECTION CONTEST" (as
such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act),
with respect to Micron or (iii) call or seek to have called any meeting of the
holders of Voting Securities of Micron.

       2.6    Acts in Concert with Others.  Except as contemplated herein, TI
shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate of TI, to participate in
the formation, or encourage the formation, of any Person which owns or seeks to
acquire beneficial ownership of, or otherwise acts in concert in respect of the
voting or disposition of, Voting Securities of Micron.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and except as contemplated herein, TI shall not,
and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate of TI to: (i) join a partnership,
limited partnership, syndicate or other group, or otherwise act in concert with
any third person, for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or disposing of Voting
Securities of Micron; (ii) seek election to or seek to place a representative
on the Board of Directors of Micron; (iii) seek the removal of any member of
the Board of Directors of Micron; (iv) otherwise seek control of the
management, Board of Directors or policies of Micron; (v) solicit, propose,
seek to effect or negotiate with any other Person with respect to any form of

or any Affiliate thereof; (vi) solicit, make or propose or encourage or
negotiate with any other Person with respect to, or announce an intent to make,
any tender offer or exchange offer for any Voting Securities of Micron; (vii)
disclose an intent, purpose, plan or proposal with respect to Micron or any
Voting Securities of Micron inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement,
including an intent, purpose, plan or proposal that is conditioned on or would
require Micron to waive the benefit of or amend any provision of this
Agreement; or (vii) assist, participate in, facilitate, encourage or solicit
any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek to do any of the foregoing.
TI shall not, and shall not cause or permit any Affiliate of TI to, encourage
or render advice to or make any recommendation or proposal to any Person to
engage in any of the actions covered by Section 2.5 and this Section 2.6
hereof.

       2.7    Termination.  The provisions of this Article 2 shall terminate
upon the earlier to occur of: (i) such time as TI (together with all Affiliates
of TI) beneficially owns in the aggregate Voting Securities of Micron
representing less than five percent (5%) of the Total Voting Power of Micron;
or (ii) the closing or other completion of a Change in Control of Micron.

make any short sale of, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, gift, pledge or
grant any options or rights with respect to, any Voting Securities of Micron,
now or hereafter acquired, or with respect to which TI (or any Affiliate of TI)
has or hereafter acquires the power of disposition (or enter into any agreement
or understanding with respect to the foregoing), except as set forth below:

              (a)    to Micron, or any Person or group approved in writing in
advance by the Board of Directors of Micron;

              (b)    to any wholly-owned subsidiary of TI, so long as such
subsidiary agrees in writing (in form reasonably acceptable to counsel for
Micron) to hold such Voting Securities of Micron subject to all the provisions
of this Agreement, and so agrees to transfer such Voting Securities of Micron
to TI or another wholly-owned subsidiary of TI if it ceases to be a wholly-
owned subsidiary of TI;

              (c)    pursuant to a firm commitment, underwritten public
offering of Voting Securities of Micron registered under the Securities Act;
provided, however, that such offering is structured to distribute such
securities through an underwriter in accordance with procedures designed to
ensure (as far as is practically possible) that beneficial ownership of the
Voting Securities of Micron with aggregate Voting Power of more than five
percent (5%) of the Total Voting Power of Micron then in effect shall not be
transferred during such underwriting to any single Person or group;

              (d)    through a sale of Voting Securities of Micron pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act; provided, however, that any such sale (i)
complies with the manner of sale provisions under paragraph (f) of Rule 144 or
(ii) is of securities with Voting Power aggregating less than five percent (5%)
of the Total Voting Power of Micron and is not made knowingly directly or
indirectly to: (A) any Person or group which has theretofore filed a Schedule
13D with the SEC with respect to any class of "EQUITY SECURITY" (as defined in
Rule 13a11-1 under the Exchange Act) of Micron and which, at the time of such
sale, continues to reflect beneficial ownership in excess of five percent (5%)
of the Total Voting Power of Micron; (B) any Person or group known to TI
(without inquiry or investigation) to beneficially own in excess of five
percent (5%) of any Voting Securities of Micron or to be accumulating stock on

the approval of one or more stockholder proposals with respect to Micron or
publicly made, or in any way participated in, any "SOLICITATION" of "PROXIES"
(as such terms are defined or used in Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act)

<PAGE>   122
              (e)    pursuant to any private sale of Voting Securities of
Micron exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act,
provided that no such sale may be made (i) to any Person or group which, after
giving effect to such sale, will beneficially own or have the right to acquire
Voting Securities of Micron with aggregate Voting Power of more than five
percent (5%) of the Total Voting Power of Micron unless such Person or group is
an institutional investor that acquires such Voting Securities solely for
investment, in which case the total number of Voting Securities that may be
sold to such Person or group shall be limited so that such Person or group
shall not own or have the right to acquire more than ten percent (10%) of the
Total Voting Power of Micron after giving effect to the proposed sale; and,
provided, further, that any such purchaser (and any transferee of such
purchaser) shall agree to take and hold such securities subject to the
provisions and upon the conditions specified in this Article 3, and it will be
a condition precedent to the effectiveness of any such transfer that TI shall
have delivered to Micron a written agreement of such purchaser to that effect
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Micron;

              (f)    in response to an offer to purchase or exchange for cash
or other consideration any Voting Securities, which in any case is not opposed
by the Board of Directors of Micron within the time such Board is required,
pursuant to regulations under the Exchange Act, to advise the stockholders of
Micron of such Board's position with respect to such offer, or, if no such
regulations are applicable, within ten (10) business days of the commencement
of such offer, or pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other business
combination involving Micron approved by the Board of Directors of Micron; or

              (g)    subject to Micron's prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), pursuant to bona fide pledges of such Restricted
Securities to institutional lenders (provided that the number of such lenders
to which, or for the benefit of which, such pledges may be made, shall not
exceed twenty (20) in the aggregate), to secure a loan, guarantee, letter of
credit facility or other indebtedness or financial support; provided that each
such lender to which, or for the benefit of which, such pledge is made agrees
in writing to hold such Restricted Securities subject to all provisions of this
Agreement, including the limitations on any sale or other disposition of such
Restricted Securities.

options or rights with respect to, any of the Subordinated Notes, now or
hereafter acquired, or with respect to which TI (or such Affiliate of TI) has
or hereafter acquires the power of disposition (or enter into any agreement or
understanding with respect to the foregoing), except through a sale of a
minimum of $10,000,000 principal amount of Subordinated Notes (and of any
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof) under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act to a "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" as defined in such Rule
144A.

       3.4    Procedures for Certain Transfers.

              (a)    The holder of each certificate representing Restricted
Securities, by acceptance thereof, agrees to comply in all respects with the
provisions of this Article 3.

              (b)    Prior to any proposed transfer of any Restricted
Securities pursuant to Sections 3.1(a), (b), (e) and (g) hereof, TI shall give
written notice to Micron of TI's intention to effect such transfer.  Each such
notice shall describe the manner and circumstances of the proposed transfer in
sufficient detail, and shall be accompanied by either: (i) a written opinion of
legal counsel (including in-house counsel), who shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Micron, addressed to Micron and reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to Micron's counsel, to the effect that the proposed transfer of
the Restricted Securities may be effected without registration under the
Securities Act; or (ii) a "no action" letter from the SEC and a copy of any
request by TI (together with all supplements or amendments thereto), which
shall have been provided to Micron at or prior to the time of first delivery to
the SEC's staff, to the effect that the transfer of such securities without
registration will not result in a recommendation by the staff of the SEC that
action be taken with respect thereto, whereupon TI shall be entitled to
transfer such Restricted Securities in accordance with the terms of the notice
delivered by TI to Micron.

              (c)    In connection with any proposed transfer of Restricted
Securities pursuant to Section 3.1(d) hereof, TI shall comply with all of the
requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and the reasonable
requirements of Micron's transfer agent with respect to sales of Restricted
Securities pursuant to Rule 144.

              (d)    Each certificate evidencing the Restricted Securities
transferred as herein provided (other than a transfer pursuant to Section
3.1(c)) shall bear the appropriate restrictive legend set forth (or described)
in Section 3.4(a) above, except that such certificate shall not bear such
restrictive legend if: (i) in the opinion of counsel for Micron, such legend is
not required in order to establish compliance with any provisions of the
Securities Act; (ii) the Restricted Securities have been held by the holder for
more than two years, and the holder represents to counsel for Micron that it
has not been an "AFFILIATE" (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 144)
of Micron during the three-month period prior to the sale and shall not become
an affiliate (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 144) of Micron
without resubmitting the Restricted Securities for reimposition of the legend;
or (iii) the Restricted Securities have been sold pursuant to Rule 144 and in
compliance with Section 3.1(d).  In addition, each certificate evidencing the
Restricted Securities transferred pursuant to this Article 3 (other than
transfers pursuant to Sections 3.1(c) and 3.1(d) hereof) shall bear the legend
set forth in Section 3.3(b) above.

       3.5    Covenant Regarding Exchange Act Filings.  With a view to making
available to TI the benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act,

to sell any Restricted Securities without registration, until the date of





                                      -10-

efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents
required to be filed under the Exchange Act.

       3.6    Termination.  The provisions of this Article 3 shall terminate
upon the later to occur of: (i) the tenth anniversary date of this Agreement

                              REGISTRATION RIGHTS

              (a)    If at any time after the six month anniversary date of
this Agreement, Micron shall receive from TI a written request (a "DEMAND
REQUEST") that Micron register on Form S-3 under the Securities Act (or if such
form is not available, any registration statement form then available to
Micron) Registrable Securities equal to at least two percent (2%) of the Voting
Securities of Micron outstanding on the date of such Demand Request, then
Micron shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities specified in such Demand Request (THE "DEMAND REGISTRABLE
SECURITIES") to be registered as soon as reasonably practicable so as to permit
the offering and sale thereof and, in connection therewith, shall prepare and
file with the SEC as soon as practicable after receipt of such Demand Request,
a registration statement (a "DEMAND REGISTRATION STATEMENT") to effect such
registration; provided, however, that each such Demand Request shall: (i)
specify the number of Demand Registrable Securities intended to be offered and
sold by TI pursuant thereto (which number of Demand Registrable Securities
shall not be less than two percent (2%) of the Voting Securities of Micron
outstanding on the date of such Demand Request); (ii) express the present
intention of TI to offer or cause the offering of such Demand Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Demand Registration Statement, (iii) describe the

plans to effect such distribution by means of an underwritten offering); and
(iv) contain the undertaking of TI to provide all such information and
materials and take all such actions as may be required in order to permit
Micron to comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and to obtain
any desired acceleration of the effective date of such Demand Registration
Statement.

              (b)    The procedures to be followed by Micron and TI, and the
respective rights and obligations of Micron and TI, with respect to the
preparation, filing and effectiveness of Demand Registration Statements and the
distribution of Demand Registrable Securities pursuant to Demand Registration
Statements under this Section 4.1 are set forth in Section 4.4 hereof.

       4.2    Shelf Registration.

              (a)    If at any time after the six month anniversary date of
this Agreement, Micron shall receive from TI a written request (a "SHELF
REQUEST") that Micron register pursuant to Rule 415(a)(1)(i) under the
Securities Act (or any successor rule with similar effect) a delayed offering
of Registrable Securities, equal to at least five percent (5%) of the Voting
Securities of Micron outstanding on the date of such Shelf Request, then Micron
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registrable Securities
specified in such Shelf Request (the "SHELF REGISTRABLE SECURITIES") to be
registered as soon as reasonably practicable so as to permit the sale thereof
and, in connection therewith, shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC as soon
as practicable after receipt of such Shelf Request, a shelf registration
statement on Form S-3 relating to such Shelf Registrable Securities, if such
Form S-3 is available for use by Micron (or any successor form of registration
statement to such Form S-3), to effect such registration (a "SHELF REGISTRATION
STATEMENT"), to enable the distribution of such Shelf Registrable Securities;
provided, however, that each such Shelf Request shall: (i) specify the number
of Shelf Registrable Securities intended to be offered and sold by TI pursuant
thereto (which number of Shelf Registrable Securities shall not be less than
five percent (5%) of the Voting Securities of Micron outstanding on the date of
such Shelf Request); (ii) express the intention of TI to offer or cause the
offering of such Shelf Registrable Securities pursuant to such Shelf
Registration Statement on a delayed basis in the future; (iii) describe the
nature or method of the proposed offer and sale of such Shelf Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement; and (iv) contain the
undertaking of TI to provide all such information and materials and take all
such actions as may be required in order to permit Micron to comply with all
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and to obtain any desired acceleration
of the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement.  TI shall not be
entitled to make more than one Shelf Request during any three hundred sixty-
five (365) day period.

              (b)    It is expressly agreed by the parties that the sole
purpose of Micron filing and maintaining an effective a Shelf Registration
Statement for the delayed offering of Shelf Registrable Securities by TI is to
make the process of distributing Registrable Securities by TI more convenient
for both parties by reducing or eliminating the need to file a new Demand
Registration Statement each time that TI decides to sell Registrable
Securities.  After a Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective
under the Securities Act by the SEC, then, upon the written request of TI (a
"TRANCHE REQUEST"), Micron shall prepare such amendments to such Shelf
Registration Statement (including post-effective amendments), if any, and such
amendments or supplements to the prospectus relating to the Registrable
Securities to be offered thereunder pursuant to such Tranche Request (the
"TRANCHE REGISTRABLE SECURITIES"), as is necessary to facilitate the
distribution of such Tranche Registrable Securities pursuant to such Tranche
Request; provided, however, that such Tranche Request shall: (i) specify the
number of Tranche Registrable Securities intended to be offered and sold by TI
pursuant thereto (which number of Tranche Registrable Securities shall not be
less than two percent (2%) of the Voting Securities of Micron outstanding on
the date of such Tranche Request); (ii) express the present intention of TI to
offer or cause the offering of such Tranche Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Shelf Registration Statement, (iii) describe the nature or method of
distribution of such Tranche Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement (including, in particular, whether TI plans to effect
such distribution by means of an underwritten offering); and (iv) contain the
undertaking of TI to





                                      -12-
<PAGE>   127
provide all such information and materials and take all such actions as may be
required in order to permit Micron to comply with all applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
SEC thereunder.

              (c)    The procedures to be followed by Micron and TI, and the
respective rights and obligations of Micron and TI, with respect to the
preparation, filing and effectiveness of Shelf Registration Statements and the
distribution of Tranche Registrable Securities pursuant to Shelf Registration
Statements under this Section 4.2 are set forth in Section 4.4 hereof.

       4.3    Piggyback Registration.

              (a)    If at any time after the six month anniversary date of
this Agreement, Micron shall determine to register any of its equity or equity-
linked securities (other than registration statements relating to (i) employee,
consultant or distributor compensation or incentive arrangements (including
employee benefit plans), (ii) acquisitions or any transaction or transactions
under Rule 145 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule with similar
effect), (iii) distributions by principal stockholders, their Affiliates or
transferees (unless consented to by such principal stockholders, Affiliates or
transferees), or (iv) pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act), then
Micron will promptly give TI written notice thereof and include in such Micron-
initiated, non-shelf, registration statement (a "PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION
STATEMENT"), and in any underwriting involved therein, all Registrable
Securities (the "PIGGYBACK REGISTRABLE SECURITIES") specified in a written
request made by TI (a "PIGGYBACK REQUEST") within five (5) business days after
receipt of such written notice from Micron; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 4.3(a), or any other provision of this Agreement, shall be
construed to limit the absolute right of Micron, for any reason and in its sole
discretion: (i) to delay, suspend or terminate the filing of any Piggyback
Registration Statement; (ii) to delay the effectiveness of any Piggyback
Registration Statement; (iii) to terminate or reduce the number of Piggyback
Registrable Securities to be distributed pursuant to any Piggyback Registration
Statement (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 4.3(c) hereof);
or (iv) to withdraw such Piggyback Registration Statement.

              (b)    If the Piggyback Registration Statement of which Micron
gives notice is for an underwritten offering, Micron shall so advise TI as a
part of the written notice given pursuant to Section 4.3(a).  In such event,
the right of TI to registration pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be
conditioned upon the agreement of TI to participate in such underwriting and in
the inclusion of such Piggyback Registrable Securities in the underwriting to
the extent provided herein.  TI shall (together with Micron and any other
holders distributing securities in such Piggyback Registration Statement, if
any) enter into an underwriting agreement (the "PIGGYBACK UNDERWRITING
AGREEMENT") in customary form with the underwriter or underwriters selected for
such underwriting by Micron.

              (c)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if
the managing underwriters of any underwritten offering pursuant to a Piggyback
Request determine, in their sole discretion that, after including all the
shares to be offered by Micron and all the shares of any other Persons entitled
to registration rights with respect to such Piggyback Registration Statement
(pursuant to other agreements with Micron), marketing factors require a
limitation of the number of Piggyback





                                      -13-
<PAGE>   128
Registrable Securities to be underwritten, the managing underwriters of such
offering may exclude any and all of the Piggyback Registrable Securities (a
"PIGGYBACK MARKET CUT-BACK").  If TI disapproves of the terms of any such
underwriting, it may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to Micron
and the managing underwriters.  Any Piggyback Registrable Securities excluded
or withdrawn from such underwriting shall be withdrawn from such Piggyback
Registration Statement.

              (d)    Except to the extent specifically provided in this Section
4.3 hereof, the procedures to be followed by Micron and TI, and the respective
rights and obligations of Micron and TI, with respect to the distribution of
any Piggyback Registrable Securities by TI pursuant to any Piggyback
Registration Statement filed by Micron shall be as set forth in the Piggyback
Underwriting Agreement, or any other agreement or agreements governing the
distribution of such Piggyback Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Piggyback Registration Statement.

       4.4    Demand and Shelf Registration Procedures, Rights and Obligations.
The procedures to be followed by Micron and TI, and the respective rights and
obligations of Micron and TI, with respect to the  preparation, filing and
effectiveness of Demand Registration Statements and Shelf Registration
Statements, respectively, and the distribution of Demand Registrable Securities
and Tranche Registrable Securities, respectively, pursuant thereto, are as
follows:

              (a)    TI shall not be entitled to make more than one Demand
Request or Tranche Request during any one hundred eighty (180) day period (the
"180-DAY LIMITATION"); provided, however, that (i) any Demand Request that: (A)
does not result in the corresponding Demand Registration Statement being
declared effective by the SEC; (B) is withdrawn by TI following the imposition
of a stop order by the SEC with respect to the corresponding Demand
Registration Statement; (C) is withdrawn by TI as a result of the exercise by
Micron of its suspension rights pursuant to Sections 4.4(e) or (f) hereof; or
(D) is withdrawn by TI as a result of a Demand/Tranche Market Cut-Back (as
defined in Section 4.4(d) hereof); and (ii) any Tranche Request that: (A) is
withdrawn by TI following the imposition of a stop order by the SEC with
respect to the corresponding Shelf Registration Statement; (B) is withdrawn by
TI as a result of the exercise by Micron of its suspension rights pursuant to
Sections 4.4(e) or (f) hereof; or (C) is withdrawn by TI as a result of a
Demand/Tranche Market Cut-Back, shall not count for the purposes of determining
compliance with the 180-Day Limitation.  Any Demand Request or Tranche Request
that is withdrawn by TI for any reason other than as set forth in the previous
sentence shall count for purposes of determining compliance with the 180-Day
Limitation.  Piggyback Requests shall not count for purposes of determining
compliance with the 180-Day Limitation regardless of whether a Piggyback
Registration Statement is filed, declared effective or withdrawn or whether any
distribution of Piggyback Registrable Securities is effected, terminated or
cut-back (pursuant to Section 4.3(c) hereof, or otherwise).

              (b)    Micron shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
each Demand Registration Statement and Shelf Registration Statement to be
declared effective promptly and to keep such Demand Registration Statement and
Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the earlier to occur
of: (i) the sale or other disposition of the Registrable Securities so
registered; (ii) sixty (60) days after (A) the effective date of any Demand
Registration Statement or (B) the date of the final prospectus used to confirm
sales in connection with any offering of Tranche Registrable Securities; and





                                      -14-
<PAGE>   129
(iii) the termination of TI's registration rights pursuant to Section 4.10
hereof.  Micron shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to each Demand Registration Statement and Shelf Registration
Statement and each prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary
to make and to keep such Demand Registration Statement and Shelf Registration
Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
with respect to the sale or other disposition of all Registrable Securities
proposed to be distributed pursuant to such Demand Registration Statement and
Shelf Registration Statement until the earlier to occur of: (i) the sale or
other disposition of such Registrable Securities so registered; (ii) sixty (60)
days after (A) the effective date of any Demand Registration Statement or (B)
the date of the final prospectus used to confirm sales in connection with any
offering of Tranche Registrable Securities; and (iii) the termination of TI's
registration rights pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof.

              (c)    In connection with any underwritten offering pursuant to a
Demand Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration Statement, Micron, on the
one hand, and TI, on the other hand, shall each select one investment banking
firm to serve as co-manager of such offering.  The co-manager selected by
Micron shall be subject to the prior approval of TI, which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, and the co-manager selected by TI shall be subject to
the prior approval of Micron, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  Each of the co-managers so selected by Micron and TI are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the "DEMAND/TRANCHE MANAGING UNDERWRITERS."  The
Demand/Tranche Underwriter selected by TI shall be the lead Demand/Tranche
Managing Underwriter, whose responsibilities shall include running the "books"
for any offering.  Micron shall, together with TI, enter into an underwriting
agreement with the Demand/Tranche Managing Underwriters, which agreement shall
contain representations, warranties, indemnities and agreements then
customarily included by an issuer in underwriting agreements with respect to
secondary distributions under demand registration statements or shelf
registration statements, as the case may be,  and shall stipulate that the
Demand/Tranche Managing Underwriters will receive equal commissions and fees
and other remuneration in connection with the distribution of any Demand
Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities thereunder.

              (d)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
number of Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities
proposed to be distributed by TI pursuant to any Demand Request or Tranche
Request may be limited by the Demand/Tranche Managing Underwriters if such
Demand/Tranche Managing Underwriters determine that the sale of such Demand
Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities would significantly
and adversely affect the market price of the Common Stock (a "DEMAND/TRANCHE
MARKET CUT-BACK").  If TI disapproves of the terms of any proposed underwritten
offering under a Demand Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration
Statement (including, without limitation, any reduction in the number of Demand
Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities, as the case may be,
to be sold by TI thereunder pursuant to this Section 4.4(d)), TI may elect to
withdraw therefrom by written notice to Micron and the Demand/Tranche Managing
Underwriters.  Any Demand Registrable Securities excluded or withdrawn from
such underwriting shall also be withdrawn from any applicable Demand
Registration Statement.

              (e)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, in
the event that Micron receives a Demand Request, Shelf Request or Tranche
Request at a time when Micron (i) shall have





                                      -15-
<PAGE>   130
filed, or has a bona fide intention to file, a registration statement with
respect to a proposed public offering of equity or equity-linked securities or
(ii) has commenced, or has a bona fide intention to commence, a public offering
of equity or equity-linked securities pursuant to an existing effective shelf
or other registration statement, then Micron shall be entitled to suspend, for
a period of up to ninety (90) days after the receipt by Micron of such Demand
Request, Shelf Request or Tranche Request, the filing of any Demand
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement or the implementation of
any Tranche Request.

              (f)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
the event that Micron determines that: (i) non-public material information
regarding Micron exists, the immediate disclosure of which would be
significantly disadvantageous to Micron; (ii) the prospectus constituting a
part of any Demand Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement
covering the distribution of any Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche
Securities contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; or (iii) an offering of Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche
Registrable Securities would materially interfere with any proposed material
acquisition, disposition or other similar corporate transaction or event
involving Micron (each of the events or conditions referred to in clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "SUSPENSION
CONDITION"), then Micron shall have the right to suspend the filing or
effectiveness of any Demand Registration Statement or Shelf Registration
Statement or to suspend any distribution of Demand Registrable Securities or
Tranche Registrable Securities pursuant to any effective Demand Registration
Statement or Shelf Registration Statement for so long as such Suspension
Condition exists.  Micron will as promptly as practicable provide written
notice to TI when a Suspension Condition arises and when it ceases to exist.
Upon receipt of notice from Micron of the existence of any Suspension
Condition, TI shall forthwith discontinue efforts to: (i) file or cause any
Demand Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement to be declared
effective by the SEC (in the event that such Demand Registration Statement or
Shelf Registration Statement has not been filed, or has been filed but not
declared effective, at the time TI receives notice that a Suspension Condition
has arisen); or (ii) offer or sell Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche
Registrable Securities (in the event that such Demand Registration Statement or
Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective at the time TI
receives notice that a Suspension Condition has arisen).  In the event that TI
had previously commenced or was about to commence the distribution of Demand
Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities pursuant to a
prospectus under an effective Demand Registration Statement or Shelf
Registration Statement, then Micron shall, as promptly as practicable after the
Suspension Condition ceases to exist, make available to TI (and to each
underwriter, if any, participating in such distribution) an amendment or
supplement to such prospectus.  If so directed by Micron, TI shall deliver to
Micron all copies, other than permanent file copies then in TI's possession, of
the most recent prospectus covering such Demand Registrable Securities or
Tranche Registrable Securities at the time of receipt of such notice.

              (g)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Micron shall not be permitted to postpone (i) the filing or effectiveness of
any Demand Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) the
distribution of any Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable
Securities pursuant to an effective Demand Registration Statement or an
effective Shelf





                                      -16-
<PAGE>   131
Registration Statement pursuant to Sections 4.4(e), 4.4(f) or 4.9(a) hereof for
an aggregate of more than two hundred seventy-five (275) days in any three
hundred sixty-five (365) day period (including any market standoff periods
applicable to TI pursuant to Section 4.9(a) hereof); provided, however, that in
the event that any TI Pooling Transaction Lock-Up (as defined in Section 4.9(a)
hereof) would expire by its terms on a date that would extend beyond the two
hundred seventy-five (275) day limitation, then Micron shall have the right to
(i) postpone the filing or effectiveness of any Demand Registration Statement
or Shelf Registration Statement or (ii) the distribution of any Demand
Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities pursuant to an
effective Demand Registration Statement or an effective Shelf Registration
Statement until such time as such TI Pooling Transaction Lock-Up expires.

              (h)    Micron shall promptly notify TI of any stop order issued
or, to Micron's knowledge, threatened, to be issued by the SEC with respect to
any Demand Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement as to which a
Tranche Request is pending, and will use its best efforts to prevent the entry
of such stop order or to remove it if entered at the earliest possible date.

              (i)    Micron shall furnish to TI (and any underwriters in
connection with any underwritten offering) such number of copies of any
prospectus (including any preliminary prospectus and any amended or
supplemented prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act, as TI (and such underwriters) shall reasonably request in order to effect
the offering and sale of any Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche
Registrable Securities to be offered and sold, but only while Micron shall be
required under the provisions hereof to cause the Demand Registration Statement
or Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to which such Demand Registrable
Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities are intended to be distributed to
remain current.

              (j)    Micron shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
register or qualify the Demand Registrable Securities and Tranche Registrable
Securities covered by each Demand Registration Statement and Shelf Registration
Statement, respectively, under the state securities or "blue sky" laws of such
states as TI shall reasonably request, maintain any such registration or
qualification current, until the earlier to occur of: (i) the sale of such
Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable Securities so registered;
(ii) sixty (60) days after (A) the effective date of any Demand Registration
Statement or (B) the date of the final prospectus used to confirm sales in
connection with such distribution (in the case of an offering of Tranche
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement); and (iii)
the termination of TI's registration rights pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof;
provided, however, that Micron shall not be required to take any action that
would subject it to the general jurisdiction of the courts of any jurisdiction
in which it is not so subject or to qualify as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction where Micron is not so qualified.

              (k)    Micron shall furnish to TI and to each underwriter engaged
in an underwritten offering of Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche
Registrable Securities, a signed counterpart, addressed to TI or such
underwriter, of (i) an opinion or opinions of counsel to Micron (with respect
to Micron and securities law compliance by Micron) and (ii) a comfort letter or
comfort letters from Micron's independent public accountants, each in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by opinions or
comfort letters, as the case may be, as TI or the managing underwriters may
reasonably request.





                                      -17-
<PAGE>   132
              (l)    Micron shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate members of its management reasonably available for due diligence
purposes, "road show" presentations and analyst presentations in connection
with any distributions of Demand Registrable Securities or Tranche Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Demand Registration Statement or a Shelf Registration
Statement.

              (m)    Micron shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
all Demand Registrable Securities and Tranche Registrable Securities to be
listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities of Micron are
then listed.

              (n)    At or prior to the effectiveness of any Demand
Registration Statement or Shelf Registration Statement covering the offering of
the 2005 Convertible Notes, Micron shall qualify the indenture (or any
supplemental indenture) relating to such 2005 Convertible Notes under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

              (o)    Micron shall make generally available to its
securityholders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an earnings statement
covering a period of twelve (12) months, beginning three months after the
effective date of any Demand Registration Statement relating to the
distribution of Demand Registrable Securities or the date of any final
prospectus used to confirm sales in connection with any offering of Tranche
Registrable Securities, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.

              (p)    Micron shall take all such other actions either reasonably
necessary or desirable to permit the Registrable Securities held by TI to be
registered and disposed of in accordance with the methods of disposition
described herein.

       4.5    Expenses.

              (a)    All of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Micron in connection with any registration pursuant to Sections 4.1 and 4.2
shall (subject to Section 4.7) be borne by TI; provided that TI shall not be
required to reimburse Micron for compensation of Micron's officers and
employees, regular audit expenses, and normal corporate costs incurred in
connection with such registration.  The costs and expenses of any such
registration shall include, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
expenses of Micron's counsel and its accountants and all other out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of Micron incident to the preparation, printing and filing
of the registration statement and all amendments and supplements thereto and
the cost of furnishing copies of each preliminary prospectus, each final
prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto to underwriters, dealers
and other purchasers of the securities so registered, the costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the qualification of such securities so registered
under the securities or "blue sky" laws of various jurisdictions, the fees and
expenses of Micron's transfer agent and all other costs and expenses of
complying with the provisions of this Section 4 with respect to such
registration (collectively, the "REGISTRATION EXPENSES").

              (b)    Micron shall pay all Registration Expenses incurred by
Micron in connection with any registration statements that are initiated
pursuant to Section 4.3 of this Agreement.  TI shall pay all expenses incurred
on its behalf with respect to any registration pursuant to Section 4.3,
including,





                                      -18-
<PAGE>   133
without limitation, any counsel for TI and all underwriting discounts and
selling commissions with respect to the Registrable Securities sold by it
pursuant to such registration statement.

       4.6    Indemnification.

              (a)    In the case of any offering registered pursuant to this
Section 4, Micron hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold harmless TI (and its
officers and directors), any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) of
Registrable Securities offered by TI, and each Person, if any, who controls TI
or any such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
any such Persons may be subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, and to
reimburse any of such Persons for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating any claims or defending
against any actions, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact contained in the registration statement under which such
Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act pursuant to
this Section 4, the prospectus contained therein (during the period that Micron
is required to keep such prospectus current), or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein (if so used) a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise
out of or are (i) based upon any such untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon information furnished to
Micron in writing by TI or any underwriter for TI specifically for use therein,
or (ii) made in any preliminary prospectus, and the prospectus contained in the
registration statement as declared effective or in the form filed by Micron
with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act shall have corrected
such statement or omission and a copy of such prospectus shall not have been
sent or otherwise delivered to such Person at or prior to the confirmation of
such sale to such Person.

              (b)    By requesting registration under this Section 4, TI
agrees, if Registrable Securities held by TI are included in the securities as
to which such registration is being effected, and each underwriter shall agree,
in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in the preceding
paragraph, to indemnify and to hold harmless Micron and its directors and
officers and each Person, if any, who controls Micron within the meaning of the
Securities Act against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or
several, to which any of such Persons may be subject under the Securities Act
or otherwise, and to reimburse any of such Persons for any legal or other
expenses incurred in connection with investigating or defending against any
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, but only to the extent it arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission of a material fact in any registration statement
under which the Registrable Securities were registered under the Securities Act
pursuant to this Section 4, any prospectus contained therein, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, which was based upon and made in conformity with
information furnished to Micron in writing by TI or such underwriter expressly
for use therein.

              (c)    Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section
4.6 (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give notice to the party required to
provide indemnification (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") promptly after such
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may





                                      -19-
<PAGE>   134
be sought, and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any
such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the
Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or litigation,
shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense at its own expense, and provided further that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 4 unless such failure
resulted in actual detriment to the Indemnifying Party.  No Indemnifying Party,
(i) in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
consent of each Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect
to such claim or litigation, or (ii) shall be liable for amounts paid in any
settlement if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

       4.7    Issuances by Micron or Other Holders.  As to each registration or
distribution referred to in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, additional shares of the
Common Stock to be sold for the account of Micron or other holders may be
included therein, provided that the inclusion of such securities in such
registration or distribution may be conditioned or restricted if, in the
opinion of the Demand/Tranche Managing Underwriters, marketing factors require
a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten.  The Registration
Expenses incurred by Micron, TI and any other holders participating in such
registration or distribution shall be borne by Micron, TI and any other holders
participating in such registration or distribution in proportion to the
aggregate number of shares to be sold by Micron, TI and such other holders.

       4.8    Information by TI.  TI shall furnish to Micron such information
regarding TI in the distribution of Registrable Securities proposed by TI as
Micron may reasonably request in writing and as shall be required in connection
with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this Article
4.

       4.9    Market Standoff Agreements

              (a)    In connection with the public offering by Micron of any of
its securities, TI agrees that, upon the request of Micron or the underwriters
managing any underwritten offering of Micron's securities, TI shall agree in
writing (the "TI PUBLIC OFFERING LOCK-UP") that neither TI (nor any Affiliate
of TI) will, directly or indirectly, offer to sell, contract to sell, make any
short sale of, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan, gift, pledge or grant any
options or rights with respect to, any securities of Micron (other than those
included in such registration statement, if any) now or hereafter acquired by
TI (or any Affiliate of TI) or with respect to which TI (or any Affiliate of
TI) has or hereafter acquires the power of disposition without the prior
written consent of Micron and such underwriters for such period of time (not to
exceed fourteen (14) days prior to the date such offering is expected to
commence and ninety (90) days after the date of the final prospectus delivered
to the underwriters for use in confirming sales in such offering) as may be
requested by Micron and the underwriters; provided, however, that neither TI
(nor any Affiliate of TI) shall be bound by such TI Public Offering Lock-Up
more than once during any twelve month period.  Furthermore, TI agrees that, at
the request of Micron,





                                      -20-
<PAGE>   135
TI shall agree in writing (the "TI POOLING TRANSACTION LOCK-UP") that neither
TI (nor any Affiliate of TI) shall, directly or indirectly, offer to sell,
contract to sell, make any short sale of, or otherwise sell, dispose of, loan,
pledge or grant any options or rights with respect to, any securities of Micron
now or hereafter acquired directly by TI (or any Affiliate of TI) or with
respect to which TI (or any Affiliate of TI) has or hereafter acquires the
power of disposition without the prior written consent of Micron for such
period of time as shall be necessary for Micron to complete any business
combination transaction in the form of a pooling of interests; provided that
Micron's independent accountants shall have concluded, after reasonable
inquiry, that, at the relevant time with respect to such proposed pooling of
interests transaction, TI is or was an "affiliate" of Micron for purposes of
the accounting rules governing pooling of interests transactions.  TI agrees
that Micron may instruct its transfer agent to place stop-transfer notations in
its records to enforce the provisions of the TI Public Offering Lock-Up and the
TI Pooling Transaction Lock-Up contained in this Section 4.9(a).

              (b)    In connection with any proposed public offering by TI of

shall agree in writing (the "MICRON PUBLIC OFFERING LOCK-UP") that neither
Micron (nor any Affiliate of Micron) will, directly or indirectly, offer to
sell, contract to sell, make any short sale of, or otherwise sell, dispose of,
loan, gift, pledge or grant any options or rights with respect to, any
securities of Micron (other than those included in such registration statement,
if any, or grants of stock options or issuances of Common Stock upon the
exercise of outstanding stock options under Micron's existing employee benefit
plans) now or hereafter acquired by Micron (or any Affiliate of Micron) or with
respect to which Micron (or any Affiliate of Micron) has or hereafter acquires
the power of disposition without the prior written consent of TI and such
underwriters for such period of time (not to exceed fourteen (14) days prior to
the date such offering is expected to commence and ninety (90) days) after the
date of the final prospectus delivered to the underwriters for use in
confirming sales in such offering) as may be requested by TI and the
underwriters; provided, however, that neither Micron (nor any Affiliate of
Micron) shall bound by such Micron Public Offering Lock-Up more than once
during any 180-day period.

       4.10   Termination.  The provisions of this Article 4 shall terminate
upon the earlier to occur of: (i) five years after the date of the closing of
transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement; and (ii) such time as
TI (and any Affiliates of TI) beneficially own in the aggregate less than
5,000,000 shares of Common Stock (assuming, for purposes of such calculation,
the conversion of all Convertible Notes then held by TI (and any Affiliates of
TI) into Common Stock).

       5.3    Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.  This Agreement may not be assigned by a party without
the prior written consent of the other party; provided that, without the
consent of Micron, TI may assign this Agreement (and the rights and obligations
hereunder) to any wholly-owned subsidiary in connection with a transfer of
Voting Securities of Micron to such Affiliate of TI pursuant to Section 3.1(b),
and without the consent of TI, Micron may assign all or part of this Agreement
(and the rights and obligations hereunder) to the successor or an assignee of
all or substantially all of Micron's business; provided that, in each case,
such assignee expressly assumes the relevant obligations of this Agreement (by
a written instrument delivered to the other party, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to it) and, notwithstanding such assignment, the parties
hereto shall each continue to be bound by all of their respective obligations
hereunder.  This Agreement is not intended and shall not be construed to create
any rights or remedies in any parties other than TI and Micron and no Person
shall assert any rights as third party beneficiary hereunder.

understanding and agreement between the parties with regard to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior agreements and

              2.1.   Interest.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6,
interest is payable in arrears in cash on the last business day of each [Insert
day and month of 6-month anniversary of Closing Date] and [Insert day and month
of Closing Date] beginning [6-month anniversary of Closing Date]. Payment of
all amounts due under the Notes shall be made by mail to the registered address
of each Holder, or if such Holder shall elect, by wire transfer to the account
designated by such Holder of





                                      -4-
<PAGE>   144
immediately available funds; provided, however, that for any Holder to receive
its interest or principal payments by wire transfer, the Company must receive
such Holder's written bank wire transfer instructions by the record date (as
defined below) for such payment. The Person in whose name any Note is
registered at the close of business on the third business day prior to any
interest or principal payment date (the "record date") shall be entitled to
receive the interest, if any, payable on such interest payment date
notwithstanding any transfer or exchange of such Note subsequent to the record
date and prior to such interest or principal payment date.

              2.2.   Optional Prepayments of Notes.  Subject to the provisions
of Section 6, the Company may, at its option, prepay all or, from time to time,
part of the principal amount of the Notes, without penalty or premium, together
with interest on the principal amount so prepaid accrued to (but not including)
the date fixed for such prepayment.

              2.3.   Allocation of Payments and Prepayments.  Each payment or
prepayment of principal of less than the entire unpaid principal amount of the
Notes shall be allocated (in units of $1,000) by the Company among the Holders
of the Notes at the time outstanding, in proportion, as nearly as practicable,
to the respective aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes (not
theretofore called for prepayment) then held by them, respectively, with
adjustments, to the extent practicable, to equalize for any prior payments or
prepayments not made in such proportion.

              2.4.    Notice of Prepayment to Holders.  Not less than three (3)
nor more than ten (10) days prior to the date fixed for each optional
prepayment, the Company shall give notice thereof to the registered Holders of
the Notes, specifying the date fixed for prepayment and the aggregate principal
amount to be prepaid on such date. Such notice shall also contain instructions
for the delivery of the Notes by the Holders to the Company.  Subject to the
provisions of Section 6, such notice shall be irrevocable.

              2.5.    Legal Holidays.  In any case where any interest payment
date or maturity date is not a Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other
provision of the Notes), payment of interest or principal, as applicable, with
respect to the Notes need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the
Interest Payment Date or Maturity Date, as the case may be.

       3.      Certain Covenants of the Company.

              3.1.   Existence.  The Company will do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
provided that this Section 3.1 shall not apply to a consolidation or merger of
the Company with or into another Person in which the Company is not the
surviving Person or conveyance, transfer or lease of the properties and assets
of the Company substantially as an entirety to another Person provided that the
transferee Person expressly assumes the due and punctual payment of the
principal and interest on all of the Notes and the performance or observance of
every covenant set forth in the Notes on the part of the Company to be
performed or observed.





                                      -5-
<PAGE>   145
              3.2.   Maintenance of Properties.  The Company will cause all
properties used or useful in the conduct of its business to be maintained and
kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all
necessary equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals,
replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as, and to the extent,
in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that the business carried on
in connection therewith may be properly and advantageously conducted at all
times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent the
Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such
properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable
in the conduct of its business and not disadvantageous in any material respect
to the Holders.

              3.3.   Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.  The Company will pay
or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become
delinquent, (a) all taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied or
imposed upon the Company or upon the income, profits or property of the
Company, and (b) all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if
unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property of the Company; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to
be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim (i) whose
amount, applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings or (ii) if the failure to pay or discharge would not
have a material adverse effect on the assets, business, operations, properties
or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

              3.4.   144A Information.  For so long as any Notes remain
outstanding, if the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Company will furnish to Holders of Notes
and to prospective purchasers of such Notes designated by such Holders the
information required to be delivered pursuant to 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act to permit compliance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act in
connection with resales of Notes.

       4.      Events of Default; Acceleration.

              4.1.   Events of Default.  The occurrence of any of the following
events shall constitute an "Event of Default" with respect to the Notes:

                     (a)    the Company defaults in the payment of the
principal of any Note when the same becomes due and payable at maturity or
otherwise (other than a default in the payment of principal resulting from
application of Section 6 hereof); or

                     (b)    the Company defaults in the payment of interest on
any Note (other than a failure to pay interest resulting from application of
Section 6 hereof) for 30 days after the same becomes due and payable; or

                     (c)    the Company defaults in the performance of or
breaches any covenant or warranty of the Company in this Note (other than a
covenant or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is
elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with), and continuance





                                      -6-
<PAGE>   146
of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has been given,
by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Holders of at least 25%
in principal amount of the Notes at that time outstanding a written notice
specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating
that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder;

                     (d)    any event or condition occurs which results in the
acceleration of the maturity of any indebtedness under any bond, debenture,
note or other evidence of indebtedness for money borrowed having an aggregate
principal amount in excess of $50,000,000 or the Company fails to pay any such
indebtedness at the final maturity thereof, and such indebtedness is not
discharged, or such acceleration is not rescinded or annulled, within a period
of 30 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the
Company by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes at that
time outstanding a written notice specifying such acceleration or failure to
pay and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; provided,
however, that if any such failure, default or acceleration shall thereafter
cease or be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled, then the Event of Default
hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise to have been thereupon
cured, notwithstanding any receipt by the Company of a Notice of Default with
respect thereto; or

                     (e)    the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the
premises of (A) a decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an
involuntary case or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or (B) a decree or
order adjudging the Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly
filed a petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
of or in respect of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or
appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator
or other similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its
property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the
continuance of any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or
order unstayed and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or

                     (f)    the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case
or proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be
adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the consent by it to the entry of a
decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or
proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or
insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it of a petition or
answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal
or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of such petition or to the
appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator,
assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of
any substantial part of its property, or the making by it of an assignment for
the benefit of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to
pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of corporate action
by the Company in furtherance of any such action.





                                      -7-
<PAGE>   147
              4.2.   Acceleration.  In the event an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, subject to the provisions of Section 6, the Holder
or Holders of 25% or more in principal amount of the Notes at the time
outstanding at its or their option may, by written notice or notices to the
Company, declare the Notes due and payable, whereupon the same shall forthwith
mature and become due and payable together with interest accrued thereon,
without presentment, demand, protest or notice, all of which are hereby waived;
provided, however, that such acceleration shall be automatic without the
necessity of any such notice in the case of Events of Default under clause (e)
or (f) above.

              4.3.   Waiver of Past Defaults.  The Holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may on behalf of the
Holders of the Notes waive any past default thereunder and its consequences,
except a default in the payment of principal of or any interest on the Note.
Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for all purposes;
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

              4.4.   Rescission and Annulment.  At any time after a declaration
of acceleration with respect to the Notes has been made and before a judgment
or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained, the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, by written notice to the
Company, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if the
Company has paid all overdue interest on all Notes and the principal of any
Notes which has become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration
and all Events of Default with respect to the Notes, other than the non-payment
of the principal of Notes which have become due solely by such declaration of
acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 4.3.

       5.      Remedies.  Subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, upon
the acceleration of the amounts due under the Notes in accordance with Section
4 or if such amounts remain unpaid after the maturity date of the Notes, any
Holder may proceed to protect and enforce any right, power or remedy granted to
it under applicable law.  If any Holder of any Note or holder of any other
indebtedness of the Company gives any notice or takes any other action in
respect of a claimed default, the Company will forthwith give written notice
thereof to all Holders of the Notes at the time outstanding describing the
notice or action and the nature of the claimed default.  No course of dealing
and no delay on the part of any Holder of any Note in exercising any right,
power or remedy will operate as a waiver thereof or otherwise prejudice such
Holder's rights, powers or remedies.  No right, power or remedy conferred
hereby is exclusive of any other right, power or remedy referred to herein or
now or hereafter available at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.

<PAGE>   148
        6.    Subordination of Notes.

              6.1.   Subordination.  The Company hereby agrees and each Holder
by its acceptance of this Note agrees that the Subordinated Claims are and
shall be postponed, subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Debt on the terms and conditions herein set
forth.

              6.2.   Permitted Payments; Deferral of Payments.  So long as
there shall not have occurred and be continuing (i) a default in the payment of
principal, premium, if any, or interest (including a default under any
repurchase or redemption obligation) or other amounts with respect to any
Senior Debt or (ii) any other event of default which has been declared in
writing, or is automatically effective in the case of Bankruptcy, Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceedings, with respect to any Designated Senior Debt (as such
event of default is defined therein or in the instrument under which it is
outstanding) and of which the Holder has received a notice (a "Blockage
Notice") from the holders of such Designated Senior Debt (each of the events
specified in clause (i) or clause (ii), a "Senior Default"), the Company shall
be permitted to make, and each Holder to accept and receive, regularly
scheduled payments of principal and accrued interest under this Note and any
prepayment of principal that the Company has decided to make, as heretofore set
forth.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Note,
the Company shall not make, and no Holder shall demand, accept, receive or
retain, any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property, securities or otherwise, on account or in respect of any Subordinated
Claim after a Senior Default has occurred or deferral of interest on any
Convertible Notes for a period of time (a "Deferral Period") in accordance with
the terms thereof has occurred.  Payments due under the Notes may be resumed
(x) in the case of a deferral of interest, after the end of a Deferral Period
(such payment to resume as set forth in the next paragraph of this Note), and
(y) in the case of defaults referred to in clauses (i) and (ii) above, upon the
earlier of:

       (A) the date upon which the default is cured or waived or ceases to
exist, or

       (B) in the case of a default referred to in clause (ii) above, the date
which is 179 days after the Blockage Notice is received,

unless this Section 6.2 otherwise prohibits the payment at the time of such
payment (including, without limitation, as a result of a payment default with
respect to the applicable Senior Debt as a consequence of the acceleration of
the maturity thereof or otherwise).

       If a Deferral Period shall occur, interest payable on all of the Notes
on regular payment dates occurring during such Deferral Period shall be
deferred and the Company shall be responsible for the payment of, and the
Company shall pay to the Person in whose name this Note is registered at the
close of business on the record date immediately preceding the regular payment
date hereunder next occurring after the termination of the Deferral Period, all
interest then accrued and unpaid together with, to the extent permitted by law,
interest thereon (compounded semi-annually on regular





                                      -9-
<PAGE>   149
payment dates) at the rate specified for the Notes.  The foregoing provisions
shall apply during successive Deferral Periods with respect to the 2004
Convertible Notes and the 2005 Convertible Notes.  The Company shall provide to
the Holders written notice of the occurrence of any Deferral Period at the time
notice thereof is given to the trustee under the Indenture, provided that any
failure to do so shall not affect the deferral of interest payments which would
occur pursuant to the terms hereof.

              6.3.   Prior Payment to Senior Debt Upon Acceleration.  In the
event that any Notes are declared due and payable before their stated maturity,
then and in such event the Holders of the Senior Debt outstanding at the time
such Notes so become due and payable shall be entitled to receive payment in
full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the Holders of Senior Debt of all
amounts due or to become due on or in respect of all Senior Debt before the
Holders of the Notes are entitled to receive any payment by the Company on
account of any Subordinated Claim.  If the payment of Notes is accelerated
because of an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify Holders of
Senior Debt of the acceleration.

                     The provisions of this Section 6.3 shall not apply to any
payment with respect to which Section 6.4 would be applicable.

              6.4.   Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings.  In the
event of any Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding:

                     (a)    Priority of Payment.  All Senior Debt shall be paid
in full in cash (but excluding indemnification obligations which are then
contingent and as to which no payment is then due and no claim or demand has
then been made) before any Holder shall be entitled to receive any payment or
distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property, securities or
otherwise, in respect of this Note in such Bankruptcy, Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding.

                     (b)    Payments and Distributions on Subordinated Claims.
Each holder of Senior Debt shall be entitled to receive any payment or
distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property, securities or
otherwise (including, without limitation, any such payment or distribution which
may become payable or deliverable by reason of the payment of any other claim
against the Company being subordinated to the payment of the Subordinated
Claims), that may become payable or deliverable to Holders on account or in
respect of any Subordinated Claim, for application to the payment of all Senior
Debt, until all holders of Senior Debt have received payment in full in cash of
all Senior Debt (but excluding indemnification obligations which are then
contingent and as to which no payment is then due and no claim or demand has
then been made).

                     (c)    Delivery and Application.  All such payments and
distributions on account or in respect of Subordinated Claims shall be delivered
by the debtor, trustee, receiver, disbursing agent or other Person making such
payment or distribution in such Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding
directly to the holders of Senior Debt.  If such payment or distribution
consists of any property or securities other than cash, (i) such payment or
distribution





                                      -10-
<PAGE>   150
shall not be deemed applied to the payment of Senior Debt at any adjudicated or
imputed value and (ii) such payment or distribution and all other and future
non-cash payments and distributions on account or in respect of Subordinated
Claims shall be delivered to and held by the holders of Senior Debt, until cash
proceeds from such non-cash payments and distributions have been received by
the holders of Senior Debt in an amount sufficient (with any other cash paid or
distributed to them by or on behalf of the Company) to pay, in full and in
cash, all of the Senior Debt (but excluding indemnification obligations which
are then contingent and as to which no payment is then due and no claim or
demand has then been made).

            (d)    Proof of Claim.

                   (1)    If any Holder fails to file a proof of claim or other
statement or demand in respect of its Subordinated Claims in such Bankruptcy,
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding prior to the 30th day preceding any bar
date or other deadline for filing a proof of claim or other such statement or
demand therein, or if any such proof of claim, statement or demand filed by any
Holder prior to such day is in any respect inadequate or insufficient (in the
good faith opinion of any holder of Senior Debt), then each holder of Senior
Debt shall have the right, but not the obligation, to execute and deliver (in
the name of such Holder or in its own name but on behalf of such Holder, as such
holder of Senior Debt may elect) and file in such Bankruptcy, Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding any proof of claim, statement or demand which such holder
of Senior Debt may determine to be required or appropriate in respect of such
Subordinated Claim.

                   (2)    To the extent necessary or reasonably appropriate to
permit the holders of Senior Debt to exercise the right granted to them under
this Section 6.4(d), each Holder hereby constitutes and appoints each holder of
Senior Debt as its attorney-in-fact and agent, with full power of substitution
and delegation, to execute, deliver and file any such proof of claim, statement
or demand as herein provided, and the power of attorney granted herein (being
coupled with an interest) is and shall be in all respects irrevocable.

                   (3)    No holder of Senior Debt shall, by executing,
delivering or filing any such proof of claim, statement or demand, become liable
or responsible in any respect for the legality, adequacy or sufficiency thereof.

                   (4)    Each holder of Senior Debt filing any such proof of
claim, statement or demand shall deliver or mail a copy thereof to the Company
at least 10 days prior to filing such proof of claim, statement or demand, but
the failure to deliver or mail such copy shall not in any respect (i) impose any
liability on such holder or upon any other holder of Senior Debt or (ii)
destroy, affect or impair the subordination provided hereby or any right, power
or benefit hereby granted to any holder of Senior Debt. The Company shall,
promptly after its receipt thereof, deliver or mail a copy of such  proof of
claim, statement or demand to each Holder.

     6.5.   Enforcement Rights.  No Holder shall have any right to enforce any
Subordinated Claim, institute or attempt to institute any Bankruptcy, Insolvency
or Liquidation





                                      -11-
<PAGE>   151
Proceeding against the Company or otherwise to take any action against the
Company or the Company's property during any periods payments on or
distributions in respect of Subordinated Claims are prohibited under Section
6.2, 6.3 or 6.4 hereof.

              6.6.   Turnover.  If and in each instance that any Holder
receives any payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property, securities or otherwise (including, without limitation, any such
payment or distribution which may become payable or deliverable by reason of
the payment of any other Claim against the Company being subordinated to the
payment of any Subordinated Claim) on account or in respect of any Subordinated
Claim which payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 6.2, 6.3 or 6.4,
at any time when any Senior Debt or any commitment to extend credit which would
constitute Senior Debt is outstanding, or at any time when payment of interest
on any Convertible Notes is deferred as aforesaid, then and in each such event:

                     (a)     Transfer and Delivery.      Each Holder shall
forthwith pay over, transfer and deliver such payment or distribution to the
holders of Senior Debt, whether or not any Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding is then pending, until the holders of Senior Debt have received
payment in full and in cash of all outstanding Senior Debt (but excluding
indemnification obligations which are then contingent and as to which no payment
is then due and no claim or demand has then been made).

                     (b)    Held in Trust. Each Holder hereby agrees to hold in
trust for the holders of Senior Debt, in the identical form received (except for
any necessary endorsement to the holders of Senior Debt) and as trustee of an
express trust, all payments and distributions required to be paid over,
transferred and delivered pursuant to this Section 6.6.

              6.7.   Subrogation.  Subject to the prior payment in full and
cash of any and all Senior Debt (but excluding indemnification obligations
which are then contingent and as to which no payment is then due and no claim
or demand has then been made), each Holder shall be subrogated to the rights of
the holders of such Senior Debt to receive payments and distributions, whether
in cash, property, securities or otherwise, applicable to the Senior Debt until
such Holder's Subordinated Claim is paid in full.  For such purposes:

                     (a)    Postponement of Subrogation.  No right of
subrogation shall be available to or may be enforced by any Holder, unless and
until the payment in full and in cash of all outstanding Senior Debt (but
excluding indemnification obligations which are then contingent and as to which
no payment is then due and no claim or demand has then been made).

                     (b)    No Representation, Warranty or Responsibility. No
holder of any Senior Debt makes any representation or warranty, or shall
otherwise have any responsibility, as to whether any such right of subrogation
is accorded or available to any Holder or is enforceable by it in any
particular circumstance.





                                      -12-
<PAGE>   152
                     (c)    No Duty; No Exoneration.  No holder of any Senior
Debt shall have any duty to any Holder to ensure, perfect, protect, enforce or
maintain any right of subrogation that might otherwise be accorded or available
to or enforceable by such Holder.  The subordination provided herein and the
rights of the holders of Senior Debt hereunder shall remain fully enforceable
on the terms set forth herein, regardless of any act, omission or circumstance
(whether or not attributable to any holder of any Senior Debt and whether or
not wrongful) which does or might in any manner or in any respect destroy,
limit, reduce, affect or impair any right of subrogation otherwise accorded or
available to or enforceable by any Holder.  Each holder of any Senior Debt
shall remain utterly free to take or fail to take any and all actions in
respect of any Senior Debt or any Person liable therefor or any collateral
security therefor (including, without limitation, each and all of the acts,
omissions and matters described in Section 6.8), without exonerating Holders,
even if any right of subrogation is destroyed, limited, reduced, affected or
impaired thereby.

                     (d)    Disallowed Senior Debt.  The subordination provided
herein and the rights of the holders of Senior Debt hereunder shall be fully
enforceable as to all Senior Debt which is not allowed, allowable or
enforceable in any Bankruptcy, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, even if
and even though no right of subrogation is available in respect of such Senior
Debt.

                     (e)    Payment of Senior Debt.  For purposes of enforcing
any right of subrogation on the terms set forth in this Section 6.7, no payment
or distribution on account of any Subordinated Claim arising in respect of this
Note applied to the payment of Senior Debt shall, as between the Company and
Holders and to the extent of the payment or distribution so applied, discharge
the liability of the Company for the payment of such Senior Debt and, to this
end, the Company shall remain obligated to pay such Senior Debt in full
notwithstanding any such application.

              6.8.   Subordination Not Prejudiced, Affected or Impaired.  No
right of any present or future holder of any Senior Debt to enforce
subordination as provided in this Note shall at any time in any way be
prejudiced, affected or impaired by any act or failure to act on the part of
the Company or by any act or failure to act on the part of any holder of Senior
Debt or by any breach or default by the Company in the performance or
observance of any promise, covenant or obligation enforceable by any Holder,
regardless of any knowledge thereof that any holder of Senior Debt may have or
otherwise be charged with.

                     (a)    Certain Acts, Omissions and Events.  Without in any
way limiting the generality of the foregoing, each holder of any Senior Debt
may at any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to
Holder, without incurring any responsibility or liability to any Holder and

prospectively), and such amendment or waiver shall be applicable to all of the

       10.    Transfer Agent and Registrar; Transfers of Notes.

              10.1.  Company Own Transfer Agent and Note Registrar.  The
Company shall serve as its own agent for the transfer and exchange of Notes and
registrar to keep a register or registers in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Company will provide for the registration

Note Register will be maintained at the office of the Company set forth in
Section 8 hereof.

              10.2.  Transfer of Notes.  Upon presentation of any Note for
registration of transfer at the office of the Company set forth in Section 8
hereof accompanied by (i) certification by the transferor that such transfer is

transfer in a form approved by the Company executed by the registered Holder,
in person or by such holder's attorney thereunto duly authorized in writing,
and including the name, address and telephone and fax numbers of the transferee
and name of the contact person of the transferee, such Note shall be
transferred on the Note Register, and a new Note of like tenor and bearing the

and exchanges of Notes shall be subject to such additional restrictions as are
set forth in the legends on the Notes and to such additional reasonable
regulations as may be prescribed by the Company.  Successive registrations of
transfers as aforesaid may be made from time to time as desired, and each such

Note and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor any agent of the
Company shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.  All such payments so
made to any such Person, or upon such Person's order, shall be valid, and, to
the extent of the sum or sums so paid, effectual to satisfy and discharge the
liability for moneys payable on any such Note.

represents and warrants as follows:

              11.1.  Qualified Institutional Buyer.  Such Holder is a
"qualified institutional buyer" as such term is defined in Rule 144A under the
Securities Act.  Such Holder has been advised that this Note has not been
registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws and,
therefore, cannot be resold unless it is registered under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws or unless an exemption from such
registration requirements is available.  Such Holder is aware that the Company
is under no obligation to effect any such registration or to file for or comply
with any exemption from registration. Such Holder has not been formed solely
for the purpose of making this investment and is acquiring the Note for its own
account, or for the account of a qualified institutional buyer to whom notice
is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, for
investment, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the
distribution thereof.

              11.2.  Access to Information.  The initial Holder of this Note
acknowledges that the Company has given such Holder access to the corporate
records and accounts of the Company and to all information in its possession
relating to the Company, has made its officers and representatives available
for interview by such Holder, and has furnished such Holder with all documents
and other information required for such Holder to make an informed decision
with respect to the acquisition of the Note.

       12.    General. This Note shall be governed by and shall be construed
and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

debentures, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness to be issued in one or
more series as provided for in the Indenture.

be in substantially the form set forth in the Indenture, or in such other form
as may be established by or pursuant to a Board Resolution or in one or more
supplemental indentures thereto, in each case with such appropriate insertions,

                            MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.

               7% Convertible Subordinated Note due July 1, 2004

No. _________                                                     $_____________

       Micron Technology, Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under
the laws of Delaware (herein called the "Company," which term includes any
successor Person under the Indenture hereinafter referred to), for value
received, hereby promises to pay to ________________, or registered assigns,
the principal sum of ___________________ Dollars on July 1, 2004 and to pay
interest thereon from June 24, 1997 or from the most recent Interest Payment
Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually on
January 1 and July 1 in each year, commencing January 1, 1998, at the rate of
7% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment.
The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any
Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the
Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest, which shall be the December 15 or June 15 (whether or not a Business
Day), as the case may be, next preceding such Interest Payment Date, subject to
the right of the Company to defer interest during an Extension Period. Any such
interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to be
payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the
Person in whose name this Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of
such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be
given to Holders of Securities of this series not less than 10 days prior to
such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the
Securities of this series may be listed, and upon such notice as may be
required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.

       So long as no Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred and is
continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time during the term of the
Securities to defer interest payments from time to time by extending the
interest payment period for successive periods (each, an "Extension Period")
not exceeding 4 consecutive semi-annual interest payment periods for each such
period; provided, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the Stated
Maturity of the Securities.  At the end of each Extension Period, the Company
shall be responsible for the payment of, and the Company shall pay to the
Person in whose name this Security is registered at the close of business on
the Regular Record Date next preceding such payment date all interest then
accrued and unpaid together with interest thereon compounded semi-annually at
the rate specified for the Securities to the extent permitted by applicable
law; provided, that during any Extension Period, the Company shall not, and
shall not allow any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or
distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment
with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock or (ii) make any payment of
principal, interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any
debt securities (including guarantees of indebtedness for money borrowed) of
the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes (other than (a)
any



                                      2
<PAGE>   161
dividend, redemption, liquidation, interest, principal or guarantee payment by
the Company where the payment is made by way of securities (including capital
stock) that rank pari passu with or junior to the securities on which such
dividend, redemption, interest, principal or guarantee payment is being made,
(b) purchases of the Company's Common Stock related to the issuance of the
Company's Common Stock under any of the Company's benefit plans for its
directors, officers or employees, (c) as a result of a reclassification of the
Company's capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one series or class of
the Company's capital stock for another series or class of the Company's
capital stock, and (d) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the
Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of
such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged).  Prior to the
termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further extend such
Extension Period; provided, that such Extension Period together with all
previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 4 consecutive semi-
annual interest payment periods and may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity
of the Securities.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the
payment of all amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extension
Period, subject to the above requirements.  No interest during an Extension
Period shall be due and payable except at the end thereof.

       The Company shall give written notice to the Trustee of its election to
begin an Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the earlier of (i)
the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on the Securities that
would have been payable but for the election to begin such Extension Period or
(ii) if the Securities are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE")
or other stock exchange or quotation system, the date the Company is required
to give notice to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or
to Holders of the Securities of the Regular Record Date or the date such
interest is payable.

       Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any interest on
this Security will be made at Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee in such
coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is
legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that
at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the
Security Register.

       Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set
forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

       Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by the
Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture or be valid or
obligatory for any purpose.

                          FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY

       This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the
Company (herein called the "Securities"),  issued and to be issued in one or
more series under an Indenture, dated as of June 15, 1997 (herein called the
"Indenture," which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such
instrument), between the Company and Norwest Bank Minnesota, National
Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture), and reference is hereby made to the
Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto for a statement of the
respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of
the Company, the Trustee, the holders of Senior Debt and the Holders of the
Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be,
authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on
the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal amount to $500,000,000.

       The Securities will not be subject to redemption prior to July 2, 1999
and will be redeemable on and after such date at the option of the Company, in
whole or in part, upon not less than 20 nor more than 60 days notice to the
Holders, at the Redemption Prices (expressed as percentages of the principal
amount) set forth below; provided, however, that the Securities will not be
redeemable following July 2, 1999 and before July 3, 2001 unless the Closing
Price Per Share of the Company's





                                       4
<PAGE>   163
Common Stock is at least 130% of the Conversion Price for at least 20 Trading
Days within a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending within five Trading
Days of the call for redemption.

       The Redemption Price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) is
as follows for the 12-month periods beginning on July 1 of the following years
(beginning on July 2, 1999, and ending on June 30, 2000, in the case of the
first such period):

     2003  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                  101%
</TABLE>

and thereafter is equal to 100% of the principal amount, in each case together
with accrued and unpaid interest (including any unpaid interest, compounded
semi-annually, that has accrued during any Extension Period) to, but excluding,
the Redemption Date; provided, however, that interest installments whose Stated
Maturity is on or prior to such Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders
of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, of record at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates referred to on the face hereof,
all as provided in the Indenture.

       In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security
or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion
hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation
hereof.

       If a Change in Control occurs, the Holder of this Security, at the
Holder's option, shall have the right, in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture, to require the Company to repurchase this Security (or any portion
of the principal amount hereof that is $1,000 or any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof, provided that the portion of the principal amount of
this Security to be Outstanding after such repurchase is at least equal to
$1,000) for cash at a Repurchase Price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus interest accrued to, but excluding, the Repurchase Date (including
any unpaid interest, compounded semi-annually, that has accrued during any
Extension Period).  At the option of the Company, the Repurchase Price may be
paid in cash or, subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture, by
delivery of shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the
Repurchase Price.  For purposes of this paragraph, the fair market value of
shares of Common Stock shall be determined by the Company and shall be equal to
95% of the average of the Closing Prices Per Share for the five consecutive
Trading Days immediately preceding the second Trading Day prior to the
Repurchase Date.  Whenever in this Security there is a reference, in any
context, to the principal of any Security as of any time, such reference shall
be deemed to include reference to the Repurchase Price payable in respect of
such Security to the extent that such Repurchase Price is, was or would be so
payable at such time, and express mention of the Repurchase Price in any
provision of this Security shall not be construed as excluding the Repurchase
Price so payable in those provisions of this Security when such express mention
is not made; provided, however, that, for the purposes of the succeeding
paragraph, such reference shall be





                                       5
<PAGE>   164
deemed to include reference to the Repurchase Price only to the extent the
Repurchase Price is payable in cash.

       The indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the extent and in the
manner provided in the Indenture, subordinate and subject in right of payment
to the prior payment in full of all Senior Debt of the Company, and this
Security is issued subject to such provisions of the Indenture with respect
thereto.  Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to
and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee
on his or her behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the Trustee as his or
her attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.

       The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance at any time of the
entire indebtedness of this Security or certain restrictive covenants and
Events of Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance
with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.

       Subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Security
is entitled, at its option, at any time on or before July 1, 2004 (except that,
in case this Security or any portion hereof shall be called for redemption or
submitted for repurchase, such right shall terminate with respect to this
Security or portion hereof, as the case may be, so called for redemption or
submitted for repurchase, as the case may be, at the close of business on the
first Business Day next preceding the date fixed for redemption or repurchase,
as the case may be, as provided in the Indenture unless the Company defaults in
making the payment due upon redemption or repurchase, as the case may be), to
convert the principal amount of this Security (or any portion hereof which is
$1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) into fully paid and non-assessable
shares of the Common Stock of the Company, as said shares shall be constituted
at the date of conversion, at the Conversion Rate of 14.8272 shares of Common
Stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities, or at the adjusted
Conversion Rate in effect at the date of conversion determined as provided in
the Indenture, upon surrender of this Security, together with the conversion
notice hereon duly executed, to the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee
accompanied (if so required by the Company) by instruments of transfer, in form
satisfactory to the Company and to the Trustee, duly executed by the Holder or
by its duly authorized attorney in writing. Such surrender (other than during
an Extension Period) shall, if made during any period beginning at the close of
business on a Regular Record Date and ending at the opening of business on the
Interest Payment Date next following such Regular Record Date (unless this
Security or the portion being converted shall have been called for redemption
on a Redemption Date during the period beginning at the close of business on a
Regular Record Date and ending at the opening of business on the first Business
Day after the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, or if such Interest
Payment Date is not a Business Day, the second such Business Day), also be
accompanied by payment in funds acceptable to the Company of an amount equal to
the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of
this Security then being converted. Subject to the aforesaid requirement for
payment and, in the case of a conversion after the Regular Record Date next
preceding any Interest Payment Date and on or before such Interest Payment
Date, to the right of the Holder of this Security (or any Predecessor Security)
of record at such Regular Record Date to receive an installment of interest
(with certain exceptions provided in the Indenture), no adjustment is to be
made on conversion for interest accrued hereon or for dividends on shares of
Common Stock





                                       6
<PAGE>   165
issued on conversion.  If, during any Extension Period, this Security (or
portion hereof) called for redemption is surrendered for conversion, any
accrued and unpaid interest on this Security (or portion hereof) as of the
Interest Payment Date occurring on or immediately preceding the conversion date
for this Security shall be paid in cash to the Holder surrendering such
Security for conversion.  The Company is not required to issue fractional
shares upon any such conversion, but shall make adjustment therefor as provided
in the Indenture.  The Conversion Rate is subject to adjustment as provided in
the Indenture. In addition, the Indenture provides that in case of certain
consolidations or mergers to which the Company is a party or the sale of
substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Indenture shall be amended,
without the consent of any Holders of Securities, so that this Security, if
then outstanding, will be convertible thereafter, during the period this
Security shall be convertible as specified above, only into the kind and amount
of securities, cash and other property receivable upon the consolidation,
merger or sale by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which
this Security might have been converted immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger or sale (assuming such holder of Common Stock failed to
exercise any rights of election and received per share the kind and amount
received per share by a plurality of non-electing shares).  In the event of
conversion of this Security in part only, a new Security or Securities for the
unconverted portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof
upon the cancellation hereof.

       If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

       The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with
the consent of the Holders of more than 50% in principal amount of the
Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to
waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and
certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such
consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of
any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is
made upon this Security.

       As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the
Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding
with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee
or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously
given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect
to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less than 25% in principal
amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made
written request to the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such
Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee reasonable indemnity, and
the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of Securities of this series at the





                                       7
<PAGE>   166
time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have
failed to institute any such proceeding, for 60 days after receipt of such
notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any
suit instituted by the Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any
payment of principal hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the
respective due dates expressed herein.

       No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and any premium and
interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or
currency, herein prescribed.

       As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of and any
premium and interest on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or its
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities
of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

       The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate
principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different
authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

       No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

       Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer,
the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat
the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for
all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company,
the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

       All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall
have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

                               ISSUANCE OF NOTES.

Section 101   Issuance of Notes; Principal Amount; Maturity.

       (a)    On June 24, 1997, the Company shall issue and deliver to the
Trustee, and the Trustee shall authenticate, Notes substantially in the form
set forth above, in each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by the
Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture, and with such letters, numbers, or
other marks of identification and such legends or endorsements placed thereon
as may be required to comply with the rules of any securities exchange or as
may, consistently herewith, be determined by the officers executing such Notes,
as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

       (b)    The Notes shall be issued in the aggregate principal amount of
$435,000,000 (or $500,000,000 if the over-allotment option set forth in Section
3 of the Underwriting Agreement dated June 19, 1997 (as amended from time to
time by the parties thereto) by and between the Company and the Underwriters is
exercised in full) and shall mature on July 1, 2004.

Section 102   Interest on the Notes; Payment of Interest.

       (a)    The Notes shall bear interest at the rate of 7% per annum from
June 24, 1997.

       (b)    The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duty provided
for, on any Interest Payment Date shall, as provided in such Indenture, be paid
to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close of business on
the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the December 15 or
June 15 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next preceding
such Interest Payment Date, subject to the right of the Company to defer
interest during an Extension Period pursuant to 102(c).  Any such interest not
so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to
the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in
whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on a Special Record
Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee,
notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Notes of this series not less than
10 calendar days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in
any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any Notes
exchange on which the Notes of this series may be listed, and upon such notice
as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in the
Indenture.

       (c)    So long as no Event of Default under the Indenture has occurred
and is continuing, the Company shall have the right at any time during the term
of the Notes to defer interest payments from time to time by extending the
interest payment period for successive periods (each, an "Extension Period")
not exceeding 4 consecutive semi-annual interest payment periods for each such
period; provided, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the Stated
Maturity of the Notes.  At the end of each Extension Period, the Company shall
be responsible for the payment of, and the Company shall pay to the Person in
whose name this Security is registered at the close of business

on the Regular Record Date next preceding such payment date all interest then
accrued and unpaid together with interest thereon compounded semi-annually at
the rate specified for the Notes to the extent permitted by applicable law;
provided, that during any Extension Period, the Company shall not, and shall
not allow any of its Subsidiaries to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or
distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment
with respect to, any of the Company's capital stock or (ii) make any payment of
principal, interest or premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any
debt securities (including guarantees of indebtedness for money borrowed) of
the Company that rank pari passu with or junior to the Notes (other than (a)
any dividend, redemption, liquidation, interest, principal or guarantee payment
by the Company where the payment is made by way of securities (including
capital stock) that rank pari passu with or junior to the securities on which
such dividend, redemption, interest, principal or guarantee payment is being
made, (b) purchases of the Company's Common Stock related to the issuance of
the Company's Common Stock under any of the Company's benefit plans for its
directors, officers or employees, (c) as a result of a reclassification of the
Company's capital stock or the exchange or conversion of one series or class of
the Company's capital stock for another series or class of the Company's
capital stock, and (d) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the
Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of
such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged).  Prior to the
termination of any such Extension Period, the Company may further extend such
Extension Period; provided, that such Extension Period together with all
previous and further extensions thereof may not exceed 4 consecutive semi-
annual interest payment periods and may not extend beyond the Stated Maturity
of the Notes.  Upon the termination of any Extension Period and the payment of
all amounts then due, the Company may commence a new Extension Period, subject
to the above requirements.  No interest during an Extension Period shall be due
and payable except at the end thereof.

       The Company shall give written notice to the Trustee of its election to
begin such Extension Period at least one Business Day prior to the earlier of
(i) the Regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date on the Notes that
would have been payable but for the election to begin such Extension Period or
(ii) if the Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE") or
other stock exchange or quotation system, the date the Company is required to
give notice to the NYSE or other applicable self-regulatory organization or to
Holders of the Notes of the Regular Record Date or the date such interest is
payable.

       (d)    Payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and any
interest on the Notes shall be made at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time
of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts; provided,
however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by
check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address
appears in the Security Register.

                              REDEMPTION OF NOTES

Section 401   Right of Redemption.

       The Notes may be redeemed in accordance with the provisions of the form

                                  ARTICLE FIVE
                              CONVERSION OF NOTES

Section 501   Conversion Privilege and Conversion Rate.

       Subject to and upon compliance with the provisions of this Article, at
the option of the Holder thereof, any Note may be converted into fully paid and
nonassessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the nearest 1/100 of
a share) of Common Stock of the Company at the Conversion Rate, determined as
hereinafter provided, in effect at the time of conversion.  Such conversion
right shall commence immediately and expire at the close of business on July 1,
2004, subject, in the case of the conversion of any Global Security, to any
applicable book-entry procedures of the Depositary therefor.  In case a Note is
called for redemption at the election of the Company or the Holder thereof
exercises his right to require the Company to repurchase the Note, such
conversion right in respect of the Note shall expire at the close of business
on the Business Day next preceding the Redemption Date or the Repurchase Date
(as defined in Article Six), as the case may be, unless the Company defaults in
making the payment due upon redemption or repurchase, as the case may be (in
each case subject as aforesaid to any applicable book entry procedures).

       If, during any Extension Period, a Note (or portion thereof) called for
redemption is surrendered for conversion, any accrued and unpaid interest on
such Note (or portion thereof) as of the Interest Payment Date occurring on or
immediately preceding the conversion date for such Note (or portion thereof)
shall be paid in cash to the Holder surrendering such Note for conversion.

       The rate at which shares of Common Stock shall be delivered upon
conversion (herein called the "Conversion Rate") shall be initially 14.8272
shares of Common Stock for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes.  The
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted in certain instances as provided in this
Article Five.

Section 502   Adjustment of Conversion Rate.

       The Conversion Rate shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
follows:

       (1)    In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other
distribution on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion
Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day following the date fixed
for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such





                                       16
<PAGE>   175
dividend or other distribution shall be increased by dividing such Conversion
Rate by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such
determination and the denominator shall be the sum of such number of shares and
the total number of shares constituting such dividend or other distribution,
such increase to become effective immediately after the opening of business on
the day following the date fixed for such determination.  If, after any such
date fixed for determination, any dividend or distribution is not in fact paid,
the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date
the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to
the Conversion Rate that would have been in effect if such determination date
had not been fixed.  For the purposes of this paragraph (1), the number of
shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in
the treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of
scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.  The
Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common
Stock held in the treasury of the Company.

       (2)    In case the Company shall issue rights, options or warrants to
all holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the current market price
per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 502) of the
Common Stock on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such rights, options or warrants (other than any rights, options or
warrants that by their terms will also be issued to any Holder upon conversion
of a Note into shares of Common Stock without any action required by the
Company or any other Person), the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of
business on the day following the date fixed for such determination shall be
increased by dividing such Conversion Rate by a fraction of which the numerator
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of
business on the date fixed for such determination plus the number of shares of
Common Stock which the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of
shares of Common Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase
at such current market price and the denominator shall be the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed for such
determination plus the number of shares of Common Stock so offered for
subscription or purchase, such increase to become effective immediately after
the opening of business on the day following the date fixed for such
determination.  If, after any such date fixed for determination, any such
rights, options or warrants are not in fact issued, or are not exercised prior
to the expiration thereof, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted,
effective as of the date such rights, options or warrants expire, or the date
the Board of Directors determines not to issue such rights, options or
warrants, to the Conversion Rate that would have been in effect if the
unexercised rights, options or warrants had never been granted or such
determination date had not been fixed, as the case may be.  For the purposes of
this paragraph (2), the number of shares of Common Stock at any time
outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of the Company but
shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu
of fractions of shares of Common Stock.  The Company will not issue any rights,
options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in the treasury
of the Company.

       (3)    In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided
into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect
at the opening of business on the





                                       17
<PAGE>   176
day following the day upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall be
proportionately increased, and, conversely, in case outstanding shares of
Common Stock shall each be combined into a smaller number of shares of Common
Stock, the Conversion Rate in effect at the opening of business on the day
following the day upon which such combination becomes effective shall be
proportionately reduced, such increase or reduction, as the case may be, to
become effective immediately after the opening of business on the day following
the day upon which such subdivision or combination becomes effective.

       (4)    In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute
to all holders of its Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness, shares of any
class of capital stock, or other property (including securities, but excluding
(i) any rights, options or warrants referred to in paragraph (2) of this
Section, (ii) any dividend or distribution paid exclusively in cash, (iii) any
dividend or distribution referred to in paragraph (1) of this Section) the
Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate
determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
close of business on the date fixed for the determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator
shall be the current market price per share (determined as provided in
paragraph (8) of this Section 502) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for
such determination less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board
of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board
Resolution filed with the Trustee) of the portion of the assets, shares or
evidences of indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common
Stock and the denominator shall be such current market price per share of the
Common Stock, such adjustment to become effective immediately prior to the
opening of business on the day following the date fixed for the determination
of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.  If, after any such date
fixed for determination, any such distribution is not in fact made, the
Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date the
Board of Directors determines not to make such distribution, to the Conversion
Rate that would have been in effect if such determination date had not been
fixed.

       (5)    In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute
to all holders of its Common Stock cash (excluding any cash that is distributed
as part of a distribution referred to in paragraph (4) of this Section) in an
aggregate amount that, combined together with (I) the aggregate amount of any
other cash distributions to all holders of its Common Stock made exclusively in
cash within the 12 months preceding the date of payment of such distribution
and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (5) has been
made and (II) the aggregate of any cash plus the fair market value (as
determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive
and described in a Board Resolution) of consideration payable in respect of any
tender offer by the Company or any of its subsidiaries for all or any portion
of the Common Stock concluded within the 12 months preceding the date of
payment of such distribution and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to
paragraph (6) of this Section 502 has been made (the "combined cash and tender
amount") exceeds 12.5% of the product of the current market price per share
(determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 502) of the Common
Stock on the date for the determination of holders of shares of Common Stock
entitled to receive such distribution times the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding on such date (the "aggregate current market price"), then,
and in each such case, immediately after the close of business on such date for
determination,





                                       18
<PAGE>   177
the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate
determined by dividing the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the
close of business on the date fixed for determination of the stockholders
entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (i) the numerator of which
shall be equal to the current market price per share (determined as provided in
paragraph (8) of this Section 502) of the Common Stock on the date fixed for
such determination less an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the excess of
such combined cash and tender amount over such aggregate current market price
divided by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date
for determination and (ii) the denominator of which shall be equal to the
current market price per share (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this
Section 502) of the Common Stock on such date for determination.

       (6)    In case a tender offer made by the Company or any Subsidiary for
all or any portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender offer (as
amended upon the expiration thereof) shall require the payment to stockholders
(based on the acceptance (up to any maximum specified in the terms of the
tender offer) of Purchased Shares (as defined below)) of an aggregate
consideration having a fair market value (as determined by the Board of
Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive and described in a Board
Resolution) that combined together with (I) the aggregate of the cash plus the
fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination
shall be conclusive and described in a Board Resolution), as of the expiration
of such tender offer, of consideration payable in respect of any other tender
offer by the Company or any Subsidiary for all or any portion of the Common
Stock expiring within the 12 months preceding the expiration of such tender
offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (6) has
been made and (II) the aggregate amount of any cash distributions to all
holders of the Company's Common Stock within 12 months preceding the expiration
of such tender offer and in respect of which no adjustment pursuant to
paragraph (5) of this Section has been made (the "combined tender and cash
amount") exceeds 12.5% of the product of the current market price per share of
the Common Stock (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 502)
as of the last time (the "Expiration Time") tenders could have been made
pursuant to such tender offer (as it may be amended) times the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the
Expiration Time, then, and in each such case, immediately prior to the opening
of business on the day after the date of the Expiration Time, the Conversion
Rate shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the rate determined by
dividing the Conversion Rate immediately prior to close of business on the date
of the Expiration Time by a fraction (i) the numerator of which shall be equal
to (A) the product of (I) the current market price per share of the Common
Stock (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 502) on the date
of the Expiration Time multiplied by (II) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any tendered shares) on the Expiration Time less (B) the
combined tender and cash amount, and (ii) the denominator of which shall be
equal to the product of (A) the current market price per share of the Common
Stock (determined as provided in paragraph (8) of this Section 502) as of the
Expiration Time multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including any tendered shares) as of the Expiration Time less the
number of all shares validly tendered and not withdrawn as of the Expiration
Time (the shares deemed so accepted up to any such maximum, being referred to
as the "Purchased Shares").





                                       19
<PAGE>   178
       (7)    The reclassification of Common Stock into securities including
other than Common Stock (other than any reclassification upon a consolidation
or merger to which Section 1409 of the Indenture applies) shall be deemed to
involve (a) a distribution of such securities other than Common Stock to all
holders of Common Stock (and the effective date of such reclassification shall
be deemed to be "the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such distribution" and "the date fixed for such determination"
within the meaning of paragraph (4) of this Section), and (b) a subdivision or
combination, as the case may be, of the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such reclassification into the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately thereafter (and the effective
date of such reclassification shall be deemed to be "the day upon which such
subdivision becomes effective" or "the day upon which such combination becomes
effective", as the case may be, and "the day upon which such subdivision or
combination becomes effective" within the meaning of paragraph (3) of this
Section 502).

       (8)    For the purpose of any computation under paragraphs (2), (4), (5)
or (6) of this Section 502, the current market price per share of Common Stock
on any date shall be calculated by the Company and be deemed to be the average
of the daily Closing Prices Per Share for the five consecutive Trading Days
selected by the Company commencing not more than 10 Trading Days before, and
ending not later than, the earlier of the day in question and the day before
the "ex" date with respect to the issuance or distribution requiring such
computation.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term "'ex' date", when used
with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the first date on which the
Common Stock trades regular way in the applicable securities market or on the
applicable securities exchange without the right to receive such issuance or
distribution.

       (9)    No adjustment in the Conversion Rate shall be required unless
such adjustment (plus any adjustments not previously made by reason of this
paragraph (9)) would require an increase or decrease of at least one percent in
such rate; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this
paragraph (9) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this Article
shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share,
as the case may be.

       (10)   The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, for
the remaining term of the Notes or any shorter term, in addition to those
required by paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this Section 502, as
it considers to be advisable in order to avoid or diminish any income tax to
any holders of shares of Common Stock resulting from any dividend or
distribution of stock or issuance of rights or warrants to purchase or
subscribe for stock or from any event treated as such for income tax purposes.
The Company shall have the power to resolve any ambiguity or correct any error
in this paragraph (10) and its actions in so doing shall, absent manifest
error, be final and conclusive.

       (11)   Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, no
adjustment of the Conversion Rate shall be required to be made (a) upon the
issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan for
the reinvestment of dividends or (b) because of a tender or





                                       20

exchange offer of the character described in Rule 13e-4(h)(5) under the
Exchange Act or any successor rule thereto.

       (12)   To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time
to time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of time
if the period is at least twenty (20) days, the increase is irrevocable during
such period, and the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that
such increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which
determination shall be conclusive; provided, however, that no such increase
shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether the Closing
Price Per Share of the Common Stock exceeds the Conversion Price by 105% in
connection with an event which would otherwise be a Change of Control pursuant
to Section 604(4).  Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Company shall give notice of the increase to the
Holders in the manner provided in Section 106 of the Indenture at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the date the increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and
such notice shall state the increased Conversion Rate and the period during
which it will be in effect.

             ARTICLE SIX  REPURCHASE OF NOTES AT THE OPTION OF THE
                        HOLDER UPON A CHANGE OF CONTROL.

Section 601   Right to Require Repurchase.

       In the event that a Change in Control (as hereinafter defined) shall
occur, then each Holder shall have the right, at the Holder's option, but
subject to the provisions of Section 602, to require the Company to repurchase,
and upon the exercise of such right the Company shall repurchase, all of such
Holder's Notes not theretofore called for redemption, or any portion of the
principal amount thereof that is equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof (provided that no single Note may be repurchased in
part unless the portion of the principal amount of such Note to be Outstanding
after such repurchase is equal to $1,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof), on the date (the "Repurchase Date") that is 45 days after the
date of the Company Notice (as defined in Section 603) at a purchase price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus
interest accrued to, but excluding, the Repurchase Date (including any unpaid
interest that has accrued during the Extension Period) (the "Repurchase
Price"); provided, however, that installments of interest on Notes whose Stated
Maturity is on or prior to the Repurchase Date shall be payable to the Holders
of such Notes, or one or more Predecessor Notes, registered as such on the
relevant Record Date according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307
of the Indenture.  Such right to require the repurchase of the Notes shall not
continue after a discharge of the Company from its obligations with respect to
the Notes in accordance with Article Four of the Indenture, unless a Change in
Control shall have occurred prior to such discharge.  At the option of the
Company, the Repurchase Price may be paid in cash or, subject to the
fulfillment by the Company of the conditions set forth Section 602, by delivery
of shares of Common Stock having a fair market value equal to the Repurchase
Price.  Whenever in this Supplemental Indenture or the Indenture (including in
the Form of Note, Section 101 of this Supplemental Indenture, and Sections
501(1) and 508 of the Indenture) there is a reference, in any context, to the
principal of any 



                                      21
<PAGE>   180

Note as of any time, such reference shall be deemed to include reference to the
Repurchase Price payable in respect of such Note to the extent that such
Repurchase Price is, was or would be so payable at such time, and express
mention of the Repurchase Price in any provision of this Supplemental Indenture
shall not be construed as excluding the Repurchase Price in those provisions of
this Supplemental Indenture or Indenture when such express mention is not made;
provided, however, that for the purposes of Article Fifteen of the Indenture
such reference shall be deemed to include reference to the Repurchase Price only
to the extent the Repurchase Price is payable in cash.

Section 602   Conditions to the Company's Election to Pay the Repurchase Price
in Common Stock.

       The Company may elect to pay the Repurchase Price by delivery of shares
of Common Stock pursuant to Section 601 if and only if the following conditions
shall have been satisfied:

       (1)    The shares of Common Stock deliverable in payment of the
Repurchase Price shall have a fair market value as of the Repurchase Date of
not less than the Repurchase Price.  For purposes of Section 601 and this
Section 602, the fair market value of shares of Common Stock shall be
determined by the Company and shall be equal to 95% of the average of the
Closing Prices Per Share for the five consecutive Trading Days immediately
preceding the second Trading Day prior to the Repurchase Date;

       (2)    The Repurchase Price shall be paid only in cash in the event any
shares of Common Stock to be issued upon repurchase of Notes hereunder (i)
require registration under any federal securities law before such shares may be
freely transferrable without being subject to any transfer restrictions under
the Securities Act upon repurchase and if such registration is not completed or
does not become effective prior to the Repurchase Date, and/or (ii) require
registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any state law
or any other federal law before such shares may be validly issued or delivered
upon repurchase and if such registration is not completed or does not become
effective or such approval is not obtained prior to the Repurchase Date;

       (3)    Payment of the Repurchase Price may not be made in Common Stock
unless such stock is, or shall have been, approved for listing on the New York
Stock Exchange or quotation on  the Nasdaq National Market, in either case,
prior to the Repurchase Date; and

       (4)    All shares of Common Stock which may be issued upon repurchase of
Notes will be issued out of the Company's authorized but unissued Common Stock
and, will upon issue, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and
non-assessable and free of any preemptive rights.

       If all of the conditions set forth in this Section 602 are not satisfied
in accordance with the terms thereof, the Repurchase Price shall be paid by the
Company only in cash.

Section 603   Notices; Method of Exercising Repurchase Right, Etc.

       (1)    Unless the Company shall have theretofore called for redemption
all of the Outstanding Notes, on or before the 30th day after the occurrence of
a Change in Control, the





                                       22
<PAGE>   181
Company or, at the request and expense of the Company on or before the 15th day
after such occurrence, the Trustee, shall give to all Holders of Notes, in the
manner provided in Section 106 of the Indenture, notice (the "Company Notice")
of the occurrence of the Change in Control and of the repurchase right set
forth herein arising as a result thereof.  The Company shall also deliver a
copy of such notice of a repurchase right to the Trustee.

       Each notice of a repurchase right shall state:

                     (i)    the Repurchase Date,

                     (ii)   the date by which the repurchase right must be
                            exercised,

                     (iii)  the Repurchase Price, and whether the Repurchase
                            Price shall be paid by the Company in cash or by
                            delivery of shares of Common Stock,

                     (iv)   a description of the procedure which a Holder must
                            follow to exercise a repurchase right, and the
                            place or places where such Notes, are to be
                            surrendered for payment of the Repurchase Price and
                            accrued interest, if any,

                     (v)    that on the Repurchase Date the Repurchase Price,
                            and accrued interest, if any, will become due and
                            payable upon each such Note designated by the
                            Holder to be repurchased, and that interest thereon
                            shall cease to accrue on and after said date,

                     (vi)   the Conversion Rate then in effect, the date on
                            which the right to convert the principal amount of
                            the Notes to be repurchased will terminate and the
                            place or places where such Notes may be surrendered
                            for conversion, and

                     (vii)  the place or places that the Note certificate with
                            the Election of Holder to Require Repurchase as
                            specified in the form of Note shall be delivered.

       No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices or defect
therein shall limit any Holder's right to exercise a repurchase right or affect
the validity of the proceedings for the repurchase of Notes.

       If any of the foregoing provisions or other provisions of this Article
Six are inconsistent with applicable law, such law shall govern.

       (2)    To exercise a repurchase right, a Holder shall deliver to the
Trustee on or before the 30th day after the date of the Company Notice (i)
written notice of the Holder's exercise of such right, which notice shall set
forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Notes to be
repurchased (and, if any Note is to repurchased in part, the serial number
thereof, the portion of the principal amount thereof to be repurchased and the
name of the Person in which the portion thereof to remain Outstanding after
such repurchase is to be registered) and a statement that an election to





                                       23
<PAGE>   182
exercise the repurchase right is being made thereby, and, in the event that the
Repurchase Price shall be paid in shares of Common Stock, the name or names
(with addresses) in which the certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock shall be issued, and (ii) the Notes with respect to which the repurchase
right is being exercised.  Such written notice shall be irrevocable, except
that the right of the Holder to convert the Notes with respect to which the
repurchase right is being exercised shall continue until the close of business
on the Business Day prior to the Repurchase Date.

       (3)    In the event a repurchase right shall be exercised in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to the Trustee
the Repurchase Price in cash or shares of Common Stock, as provided above, for
payment to the Holder on the Repurchase Date or, if shares of Common Stock are
to be paid, as promptly after the Repurchase Date as practicable, together with
accrued and unpaid interest to the Repurchase Date payable with respect to the
Notes as to which the repurchase right has been exercised; provided, however,
that installments of interest that mature on or prior to the Repurchase Date
shall be payable in cash to the Holders of such Notes, or one or more
Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the
relevant Regular Record Date.

       (4)    If any Note (or portion thereof) surrendered for repurchase shall
not be so paid on the Repurchase Date, the principal amount of such Note (or
portion thereof, as the case may be) shall, until paid, bear interest to the
extent permitted by applicable law from the Repurchase Date at the rate of 7%
per annum, and each Note shall remain convertible into Common Stock until the
principal of such Note (or portion thereof, as the case may be) shall have been
paid or duly provided for.

       (5)    Any Note which is to be repurchased only in part shall be
surrendered to the Trustee (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires,
due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the
Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holder of
such Note without service charge, a new Note or Notes, containing identical
terms and conditions, each in an authorized denomination in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unrepurchased portion of the principal
of the Note so surrendered.

       (6)    Any issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the
Repurchase Price shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the
close of business on the Repurchase Date and the Person or Persons in whose
name or names any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall
be issuable upon such repurchase shall be deemed to have become on the
Repurchase Date the holder or holders of record of the shares represented
thereby; provided, however, that any surrender for repurchase on a date when
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall constitute the
Person or Persons in whose name or names the certificate or certificates for
such shares are to be issued as the record holder or holders thereof for all
purposes at the opening of business on the next succeeding day on which such
stock transfer books are open.  No payment or adjustment shall be made for
dividends or distributions on any Common Stock issued upon repurchase of any
Note declared prior to the Repurchase Date.





                                       24
<PAGE>   183
       (7)    No fractions of shares shall be issued upon repurchase of Notes.
If more than one Note shall be repurchased from the same Holder and the
Repurchase Price shall be payable in shares of Common Stock, the number of full
shares which shall be issuable upon such repurchase shall be computed on the
basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes so repurchased.  Instead
of any fractional share of Common Stock which would otherwise be issuable on
the repurchase of any Note or Notes, the Company will deliver to the applicable
Holder a check for the current market value of such fractional share.  The
current market value of a fraction of a share is determined by multiplying the
current market price of a full share by the fraction, and rounding the result
to the nearest cent.  For purposes of this Section, the current market price of
a share of Common Stock is the Closing Price Per Share of the Common Stock on
the Trading Day immediately preceding the Repurchase Date.

       (8)    Any issuance and delivery of certificates for shares of Common
Stock on repurchase of Notes shall be made without charge to the Holder of
Notes being repurchased for such certificates or for any tax or duty in respect
of the issuance or delivery of such certificates or the Notes represented
thereby; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay any
tax or duty which may be payable in respect of (i) income of the Holder or (ii)
any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of certificates for shares of
Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of the Notes being
repurchased, and no such issuance or delivery shall be made unless and until
the Person requesting such issuance or delivery has paid to the Company the
amount of any such tax or duty or has established, to the satisfaction of the
Company, that such tax or duty has been paid.

       (9)    All Notes delivered for repurchase shall be delivered to the
Trustee to be canceled at the direction of the Trustee, which shall dispose of
the same as provided in Section 309 of the Indenture.

Section 604   Certain Definitions.

       For purposes of this Article Six,

       (1)    the term "beneficial owner" shall be determined in accordance

       (2)    a "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred at the
time, after the original issuance of the Notes, of:

not then outstanding being deemed outstanding for purposes of calculating such
percentage), other than any such acquisition by the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company existing on the date of
this Supplemental Indenture; or

              (ii)   any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the
Company into, any other Person, any merger of another Person into the Company,
or any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets (other than
to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company) of the Company to any other Person
(other than (a) any such transaction pursuant to which the holders of 50% or
more of the total voting power of all shares of capital stock of the Company
entitled to vote generally in elections of directors immediately prior to such
transaction have, directly or indirectly, at least 50% or more of the total
voting power of all shares of capital stock of the continuing or surviving

exchange or cancellation of outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
or (y) which is effected solely to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of
the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of
outstanding shares of Common Stock into solely shares of common stock);

provided, however, that a Change in Control shall not be deemed to have
occurred if either (a) the Closing Price Per Share of the Common Stock for any
five Trading Days within the period of 10 consecutive Trading Days ending
immediately after the later of the Change in Control or the public announcement
of the Change in Control (in the case of a Change in Control under clause
604(2)(i) above) or the period of 10 consecutive Trading Days ending
immediately before the Change in Control (in the case of a Change in Control
under clause 604(2)(ii) above) shall equal or exceed 105% of the Conversion
Price of the Notes in effect on each such Trading Day, or (b) all of the
consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments
made pursuant to dissenters' appraisal rights) in a merger or consolidation
constituting the Change in Control described in clause 604(2)(i) and/or clause
604(2)(ii) above consists of shares of common stock traded on a national
securities exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market (or will be so
traded or quoted immediately following the Change in Control) and as a result
of such transaction or transactions the Notes become convertible solely into
such common stock.

       (3)    for purposes of Section 604(2)(i), the term "person" shall
include any syndicate or group which would be deemed to be a "person" under
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act, as in effect on the date of the original
execution of this Supplemental Indenture.

Section 605   Consolidation, Merger, etc.

       In the case of any consolidation, conveyance, sale, transfer or lease of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to which Section 1409
applies, in which the Common Stock of the Company is changed or exchanged as a
result into the right to receive shares of stock and other securities or
property or assets (including cash) which includes shares of Common Stock of
the Company or common stock of another Person that are, or upon issuance will
be, traded on a United States national securities exchange or approved for
trading on an established automated over-the-

time such change or exchange becomes effective in excess of 50% of the
aggregate fair market value of such shares of stock and other securities,
property and assets (including cash) (as determined by the Company, which
determination shall be conclusive and binding), then the Person formed by such
consolidation or resulting from such merger or combination or which acquires
the properties or assets (including cash) of the Company, as the case may be,
shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall
comply with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of
such supplemental indenture) modifying the provisions of this Supplemental
Indenture relating to the right of Holders to cause the Company to repurchase
the Notes following a Change in Control, including without limitation the
applicable provisions of this Article Six and the definitions of the Common
Stock and Change in Control, as appropriate, and such other related definitions

determination shall be conclusive and binding), to make such provisions apply
in the event of a subsequent Change of Control to the common stock and the
issuer thereof if different from the Company and Common Stock of the Company
(in lieu of the Company and the Common Stock of the Company).

Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding
Notes a written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be
remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder.

       THIS TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made effective
as of the Closing Date by and between Perry, a Delaware corporation ("Seller"
or "Perry") and Dixie, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer").


                                   WITNESSETH

       WHEREAS, Seller and Dixie have entered into that certain Acquisition
Agreement dated as of June __, 1998 (the "Acquisition Agreement"), pursuant to
which Seller agreed to sell to Dixie the "Acquired Assets" and Dixie has agreed
to assume from Seller the "Assumed Liabilities" ( all defined terms not defined
herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Acquisition Agreement).

       WHEREAS, in consideration of the historical interconnections between the
Acquired Assets and Perry, the parties desire to provide certain support,
services, goods, and facilities to each other in order to promote the efficient
operation of their respective businesses, during the period in which the
functional separation contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement will occur (the
"Transition Services").
       WHEREAS, such Transition Services shall be provided for the period
specified in any applicable Supplemental Agreement, as defined below, or, if no
such Supplemental Agreement, then for a period of twelve (12) months (the
"Transition Period");

       WHEREAS, Seller has agreed to provide to Buyer, and Buyer desires the
right to purchase from Seller certain Transition Services on the terms and
conditions more particularly set forth herein or as the parties may otherwise
agree in writing;

       WHEREAS, Seller desires Buyer to continue to provide, and the Buyer has
agreed to continue to provide to Seller, certain Transition Services currently
provided by the Business to Seller on the terms and conditions more
particularly set forth herein or as the parties may otherwise agree in writing;

       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and agreement
herein set forth, Seller and Buyer, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                            NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT

       1.1    The following are general terms and conditions under which Seller
will provide to Buyer, and Buyer shall provided to Seller,  the Transition
Services.  The Transition Services will be provided in accordance with these
general terms and conditions and in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth in the Supplements attached hereto as Supplements _________ through
__ ____ and made a part of this Agreement, and any future Supplemental
Agreement hereto entered into between Seller and Buyer, as such agreements may
be modified, amended or extended.

       1.2    The terms of this Agreement and the applicable Supplemental
Agreement shall both apply to the Services being performed.  To the extent
general terms contained herein are not contradicted by the terms of the
Supplemental Agreement, the general terms in this Agreement shall govern.  In
any case where the terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Supplemental
Agreement are in conflict, the terms of the Supplemental Agreement shall take
precedence.  In this regard it is agreed by the parties that the Supplemental
Agreement may provide terms and conditions as to the nature, scope, volume and
type of the Transition Services covered thereby, in which case the terms of the
Supplemental Agreement shall prevail as to such matters.

       1.3    In the event of any conflict between any preprinted terms on a
purchase order that may be used between Seller and Buyer relating to the
Services and the terms of this Agreement or any applicable Supplemental
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement or the applicable Supplemental Agreement
shall control and such purchase order shall be deemed binding, only if accepted
in writing by the vendee thereof.


                                   ARTICLE 2
                                    SERVICES

       2.1    The Transition Services shall include the Transition Services
anticipated by the "Supplemental Agreements" described below.  It is the basic
intent of the parties that Transition Services of like kind, quality and
amount, as performed prior to the date hereof by the Seller Group members for
the Business, as customers, or as presently performed by the Business for the
Seller Group members (other than the Buyer Operating Group members), as
customers, will be made available to the party or parties needing such
Transition Service as necessary to promote a smooth and efficient functional
separation of the Business from the operations of Seller.  In addition, the
parties acknowledge that they may in good faith agree to include in the
Supplemental Agreements services beyond (in volume, type and nature) those
historically provided to the Business.  When mutually agreed upon in a
Supplemental Agreement, these Transition Services may include those reasonably
necessary to support continued operation of the Business as such Business was
conducted at the time of Closing and those reasonably necessary to provide for
a smooth and orderly transition by Buyer into the operation of the Business as
soon as reasonably practicable during the Transition Period.  The Supplemental
Agreements are:

Transition Activities will be set forth in the Facility Agreement for such
premises.  During the Transition Period, Seller and Buyer agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate a functional separation of their
respective operations and complete the Transition Activities as soon as
reasonably practicable.  During the Transition Period, Seller and Buyer agree
to cooperate in good faith to facilitate a smooth transition with minimal
disruption to ongoing operations of both parties.  If appropriate under the

              2.1.xx [Insert such other Transition Services as the Buyer and

Services" not contemplated by this Agreement or the Supplemental Agreements

as may be identified and mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties, shall

a Seller Group member.  Buyer and Seller shall document the inclusion in this
Agreement of such Additional Transition Services hereunder by an amendment,
letter agreement, or memorandum signed by duly authorized representatives of
both parties, referencing and incorporating (unless the parties agree otherwise
in such document) this Agreement, as appropriate and agreed upon by the
parties.

       2.3    Except where otherwise specified in any Supplemental Agreement,
the party providing the Services shall retain the right, in its reasonable
discretion to select, change or outsource any equipment, materials, procedures,
or personnel (including vendors, suppliers, or contractors) used in performing
the Services so long as such action does not materially and adversely affect
the costs, quality, kind or amount of the Services being provided including any
required specifications in or pursuant to a Supplemental Agreement are
satisfied.  At its option, the party providing the services, without the
consent of the other party, may assign or subcontract any or all of its rights
and/or obligations hereunder to any of its subsidiaries or any entity acquiring
substantially all of the assets of the business unit of the party by whom any
particular service is provided under any of the Supplemental Agreements.  As
used herein, "subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in the Acquisition
Agreement.  If a party intends to assign or subcontract its rights and
obligations hereunder or under any of the Supplemental Agreements as permitted
by this Section 2.2, such party shall notify the other party within thirty (30)
days prior to such assignment or subcontracting.  Further, any permitted
assignee or subcontractor shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement and any

       2.4    Unless otherwise specifically agreed, the party receiving a
Service hereunder may terminate such Service or a portion thereof at any time
by giving written notice to the other party.  The parties shall cooperate to
provide as much advance notice of termination as possible, but not fewer than
thirty (30) days, unless mutually agreed.


                                   ARTICLE 3
                                  COMPENSATION

       3.1    Unless otherwise specifically provided in any Supplemental
Agreement, amounts payable for Transition Services shall be charged at the
service provider's cost, it being the intent and agreement of the parties that
the service provider shall not make a profit on charges for Transition
Services, except as otherwise specifically agreed [CHECK WITH TAX: or to the
extent the billing for the Transition Service is made by a service provider
located in one country to a service recipient located in another, in which case
any profit shall be limited to the minimum amount required by applicable Law].

       3.2    In the event a service recipient for any reason, or a service
provider in accordance with its rights under a Supplemental Agreement, elects
to terminate a Transition Service, the recipient shall be liable for charges
for such Transition Service performed accruing through the effective date of
termination.

       3.3    Where practical (i.e., where Transition Service-related charges
are collected on Seller's financial systems) and unless otherwise provided in
any Supplemental Agreement, Seller will account  for all charges to be paid by
Buyer to Seller and any charges to be paid by Seller to Buyer under this
Agreement, any Supplemental Agreement, and any similar service-related
agreements through a consolidated statement of account.  As appropriate, such
consolidated statements may be prepared and administered on a country-specific
basis reasonably agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.  To facilitate the generation
of these consolidated statements, Buyer shall collect Transition Service-
related charges

resident on Buyer financial systems and promptly forward such information to
Seller for inclusion in the appropriate consolidated statement of account.

              The consolidated statements shall include a summary of charges
and a report detailing each category of charges for the previous billing month.
The consolidated statements of account shall be issued no later than the
fourteenth working day following the month to which the statement of account
applies.  Beginning on the Closing Date, Seller will issue the consolidated
statements of account on a monthly basis.

       3.4    Statements issued pursuant to 3.3 shall be due and payable within
thirty (30) days from date of invoice, which shall be attached to the
consolidated statement.  All charges are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise
stated and agreed by Buyer and Seller, and are net of any applicable taxes and
fees imposed by any Government Agency as a result of either party's use of any
services provided hereunder, which shall be such party's sole obligation to
pay.

                                   ARTICLE 7
                     CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND MATERIAL

       7.1    Seller and Buyer shall maintain and treat as confidential and
secret all information and materials which may be disclosed by the other party
in connection with such party's performance of Services hereunder and
identified in writing thereon as being proprietary, confidential or secret (the
"Confidential Information").

       7.2    Seller and Buyer shall not disclose the Confidential Information
to any third party, shall restrict disclosure of such information and material
to employees who have a need to know, and shall employ the same standard of
care each uses to protect its own proprietary, confidential or secret
information and material of like importance.

       7.3    Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may disclose Confidential
Information of the other party hereto to the extent that (a) disclosure is
compelled by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion of the
disclosing party's counsel, by other requirements of law, or (b) such party can
show that such Confidential Information (i) was publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement or thereafter becomes publicly available without any
violation of this Agreement on the part of such party or its employees, agents,
affiliates, associates or representatives, or (ii) became available to such
party from a person other than the other party hereto that is subject to any
legally binding obligation to keep such Confidential Information confidential.

       7.4    The existence of this Agreement and any Supplemental Agreement
and the terms and conditions hereof or thereof shall not be disclosed by any
party without the prior written consent of the other parties (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld), or as may be required by law or as may be necessary
to establish a party's rights hereunder in a court of law or other legal
proceeding.

       7.5    The obligations of this Article 7 shall survive the expiration or
termination of this Agreement.

       8.1    This Agreement shall commence as of the Closing Date and shall

       8.2    This clause shall not be deemed to waive, prejudice or diminish
any rights Buyer or Seller may have at law or in equity against any third
party.

                                 FORCE MAJEURE

       9.1    Neither party shall be responsible for any delay or failure in
performance or for any loss, damage, costs, charges and expenses incurred or
suffered by the other party by reason thereof if such delay or failure results
from the occurrence of an event beyond the reasonable control of such party and
without the fault or negligence of such party ("force majeure") including, but
not limited to, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in
either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics,
quarantine restrictions, strikes, freight embargoes, unusually severe weather,
failure of suppliers, terrorism, or civil strife.  If any party to this
Agreement is rendered wholly or partially unable by an event or force majeure
to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, and if that party gives
prompt written notice and full particulars of such event of force majeure to
the other party, the notifying party shall be excused from performance of its
obligations hereunder during the continuance of any inability so caused, but
for no longer period.  Both parties shall use all commercially reasonable
efforts to remove or avoid the condition as soon as commercially practicable.

                                 GOVERNING LAW

       10.1   This Agreement and the Supplemental Agreements shall not be
governed by the provisions of the 1980 United Nations Convention or Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods, but shall be governed by, construed and
interpreted and the rights of the parties determined in accordance with the
laws of the State of New York without regard to the choice of law principles
thereof.

       10.2   Seller and Buyer recognize that application of non-U.S. law to
the Agreement and/or the Supplemental Agreements (collectively, the "Transition
Agreements") could serve to frustrate the intent or expectations of the parties
as expressed therein (the "Intent").  Under such circumstances, the parties
agree to cooperate reasonably to make such changes in this Agreement and the
Supplemental Agreements, and to take such other actions as may be reasonably
necessary, to implement the Intent under any applicable non-U.S. law or in any
non-U.S. jurisdiction.

News Release
C-98042

                          Micron Technology to Purchase
                       Memory Business of Texas Instruments

     Boise, Idaho/Dallas, Texas, (June 18, 1998) -- Micron Technology, Inc.,
(NYSE: MU) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) announced today a
definitive agreement for Micron to purchase the assets of TI's semiconductor
memory business for a combination of common stock and assumption of debt
totaling approximately $800 million (at Micron's current stock price). The
transaction includes the purchase of substantially all of TI's memory assets, as
well as TI's shares in its two DRAM manufacturing joint ventures.

     This transaction strengthens the strategic roadmap of each company. Micron
expands its leadership in the memory market and its international presence,
while TI solidifies its position as a company focused on digital signal
processing and analog semiconductors.

     Under the terms of the agreement, upon closing TI will receive
approximately 28.9 million shares of Micron common stock, $740 million principal
amount of seven-year, 6.5 percent notes convertible into an additional 12
million shares of Micron common stock, and a $210 million principal amount,
seven year, 6.5 percent subordinated note. The market value of these notes is
expected to be substantially less than their face amount. Micron also will
assume approximately $190 million of government-sponsored debt associated with
TI's Italian memory operations.

     In addition to TI's memory assets, Micron will receive $750 million in
financing from TI to facilitate the deployment of Micron's technology throughout
the business. Micron and TI have also agreed upon a 10-year royalty-free
semiconductor patent cross-license agreement, to begin January 1, 1999. TI will
retain ownership of its related patents.

     TI currently operates three wholly owned manufacturing facilities that are
included in the transaction: a wafer fabrication facility in Avezzano, Italy; a
wafer fabrication facility in Richardson, Texas (formerly known as TwinStar);
and an assembly/test facility in Singapore. Also included in the transaction is
TI's interest in two joint ventures: TECH Semiconductor Singapore, owned by TI,
Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and the Singapore Economic Development Board; and KTI
Semiconductor in Japan owned by TI and Kobe Steel. TI currently owns an
approximate 25 percent interest in each joint venture and has rights to 100
percent of the production of each joint venture. Micron expects to offer
positions to most of the TI memory employees.

     "This strategic acquisition will enhance Micron's position as the most
cost-effective memory producer in the world, by leveraging our leading-edge






<PAGE>   2

technology into existing fabs without significantly increasing R&D,
administrative and operating costs," said Steve Appleton, chairman, CEO and
president of Micron. "The additional global capabilities, including
participation in a unique joint-venture manufacturing strategy, positions Micron
to take advantage of future markets."

     Thomas J. Engibous, TI chairman, CEO and president, said: "Several years
ago, TI set a course to become a company focused on its leadership position in
digital signal processing solutions. With this latest transaction, TI truly
becomes a DSP solutions company, and we do so under an innovative agreement that
positions TI to benefit from an upturn in the memory market."

     The transaction is subject to several contingencies, including satisfactory
completion of due diligence, completion of appropriate agreements with various
third parties (including relevant government authorities), as well as customary
regulatory approvals (including Hart-Scott-Rodino and European Union antitrust
reviews). The transaction is expected to close in the second half of this year.

     In conjunction with the transaction, TI will close its Richardson, Texas,
memory manufacturing operation, with Micron retaining the facility for future
capacity, pending a market upturn.

     Separately, TI today announced a worldwide restructuring program. Over the
past several years, TI has transformed itself from a multi-business corporation
to a semiconductor company focused on digital signal processing solutions. In
doing so, TI has divested 12 businesses. As a result of these divestitures, the
pending sale of the memory business and weakness in the current semiconductor
market environment, TI will implement a worldwide restructuring program to more
closely match the size and cost of its support functions with the company's
overall size, and further combine manufacturing resources for more efficient
operations. The plan will include the elimination of approximately 3,500 jobs
around the world over the next few months through voluntary programs, attrition,
outsourcing and layoffs, as well as the closing of several facilities. When
fully implemented, the ongoing pretax savings from the restructuring is expected
to be about $270 million annually, which essentially offsets the fixed and
allocated costs of the memory business that are not absorbed by Micron.

     TI expects to take a material charge for the restructuring in the second
quarter of 1998. In connection with the sale of the memory business, TI could
recognize a material loss when the transaction closes, based on the current
price of Micron common stock.
