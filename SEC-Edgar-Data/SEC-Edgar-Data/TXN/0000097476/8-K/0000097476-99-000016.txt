         Texas Instruments Closes Acquisition of Unitrode Corporation

Dallas (October 15, 1999) - Texas Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) today
completed its previously announced acquisition of Unitrode Corporation

complete solution and faster time to market.

The company will continue to operate from its headquarters in Merrimack, New
Hampshire, as a wholly owned subsidiary of TI.
