ITEM 2.  Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

         On June 18, 1998, Texas Instruments Incorporated (the "Registrant")
and Micron Technology, Inc. ("Micron") announced that they had entered into an
agreement for Micron to purchase the assets of Registrant's semiconductor
memory business (the "Memory Business"). The transaction included the purchase
of substantially all of Registrant's memory assets, including its wholly-owned
fabs in Avezzano, Italy and Richardson, Texas, its shares in its DRAM
manufacturing joint ventures in Japan and Singapore, and an assembly and test
operation in Singapore. The closing of the sale was consummated on September
30, 1998. Registrant received approximately 28.9 million shares of Micron
common stock valued at $881 million as of the closing date, $740 million in
6.5% notes convertible into an additional 12 million shares of Micron common
stock, and a $210 million 6.5% subordinated note. The aggregate market value of
the 6.5% convertible notes and the 6.5% subordinated note as of the closing
date was approximately $836 million.

In addition to Registrant's memory assets, Micron received $550 million in
proceeds from financing provided by Registrant to facilitate the deployment of
Micron's technology throughout the acquired business. As part of the
transaction, Micron also received a 10 year royalty free cross license
agreement. Additionally, Registrant agreed to guarantee the payment obligations
of one of its former joint ventures under a newly-syndicated $450 million
principal amount credit facility. At closing, the joint venture had borrowed
$210 million under the facility. As a result of the guarantee, Registrant was
granted a security interest in the joint venture's assets. In addition, the
guarantee is partially offset by certain contingent funding obligations of the
joint venture shareholders. Registrant recognized a before-tax gain of $127
million on the sale, which will be deferred until the repayment of the
Registrant-funded financing to Micron.

                        Group or to the landlord or landowner thereunder.

         Section 28. Section 6.1(a) of the Acquisition Agreement is amended to
add, in the third sentence immediately following the phrase "(other than the
initial two subscriber shares already held by Seller)" the following:

                  and Singapore Newco's $150,253,000 5.47% Promissory Note as
                  attached hereto as Exhibit K (the "Singapore Newco Note")

         Section 29. Section 6.1(b) of the Acquisition Agreement is amended by
deleting the last sentence of Section 6.1(b) in its entirety and by replacing
it with the following:

                           On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause
                  Italian Operating Company and Italian Newco to execute a
                  contribution-in-kind agreement (including appropriate
                  schedules of assets to be assigned to, and specific
                  liabilities (including Contract liabilities) to be assumed
                  by, Italian Newco) with terms and conditions reasonably
                  satisfactory to Buyer.

         Section 30. Section 6.4 of the Acquisition Agreement is amended (i)
to delete the word "Business" wherever it appears in such Section 6.4 and to
replace such word with the words "Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities" and
(ii) to delete the words "GAAP consistently applied and consistent with the
GAAP principles used to prepare the March Balance Sheet" wherever it appears
in such Section 6.4 and to replace such words with the words "Exhibit L
hereto".

         Section 31. Section 6.4 is amended by adding, at the end thereof,
new Sections 6.4 (g) and (h) as follows:

                  (g)  If, in connection with the contribution-in-kind
                       transaction contemplated in Section 6.1(b), Italian
                       Operating Company, within 90 days after the Closing
                       Date, contributes cash or marketable securities to
                       Italian Newco solely in order to make the value of
                       net assets contributed to Italian Newco equal to the
                       contribution value of net assets reported prior to
                       the Closing, then Buyer shall be obliged to promptly
                       reimburse Seller for such contribution made by
                       Italian Operating Company in satisfaction of such
                       gross-up obligation.  If Italian Operating Company
                       makes any such payment, the Buyer's reimbursement
                       obligation in respect thereof may be satisfied by
                       adding such amount to any payment by Buyer, or
                       deducting such amount from any payment by Seller, of
                       the Working Capital Requirement.

                  (h)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 6.4,
                       Seller may, at its option elect to reassume and
                       attempt to collect for its benefit any accounts
                       receivable of the Business shown on the Closing
                       Balance Sheet which remain uncollected 90 days after
                       the Closing Date, and in such event, such accounts
                       receivable shall not be included in the Closing
                       Balance Sheet. Moreover, from the Closing Date to the
                       date on which the Closing Balance Sheet is delivered,
                       Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts
                       to sell inventory at prevailing market rates.

         Section 32. Section 6.15 of the Acquisition Agreement is amended by
adding to the end of the first sentence thereof the following:

                  ; provided, however, that Licensed IP shall not include the
                  words or name "Texas Instruments Incorporated", "Texas
                  Instruments" or "TI", or Seller's related monograms, logos,
                  trademarks, trade names, or any variations or combinations
                  thereof.

         Section 33. Section 6.18 of the Acquisition Agreement is amended by
deleting Section 6.18 in its entirety and by replacing it with the following:

                  The valuation and allocation of the purchase price and other
                  consideration exchanged in connection with the transactions
                  described herein (i) have been determined in accordance with
                  the Issue Price, the Tax Parameters and the applicable
                  provisions of Section 1060 of the Code, and (ii) are set
                  forth in Exhibit M (such valuation and allocation being
                  referred to herein as the "Price Allocation").  Exhibit M
                  also sets forth certain assumptions that were used in
                  preparing the Price Allocation.  The Price Allocation shall
                  be adjusted as necessary to reflect the Closing Balance
                  Sheet or the incorrectness of such assumptions. Any disputes
                  involving the Price Allocation shall be resolved in
                  accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.4(d)
                  hereof and the provisions of this Section 6.18. Each party
                  (and their respective Affiliates) hereto shall at its own
                  expense adopt and abide by such Price Allocation, Issue
                  Price and Tax Parameters for purposes of all Tax Returns
                  filed by them and shall not take any position inconsistent
                  therewith in connection with any examination of any Tax
                  Return, any refund claim, or any judicial litigation
                  proceeding but only if doing otherwise in such judicial
                  litigation proceeding would materially prejudice the other
                  party, or otherwise until there has been a final
                  "determination" (within the meaning of Code Section 1313(a))
                  or any other event which finally and conclusively establishes
                  the amount of any liability for Taxes. In the event that the
                  Price Allocation is disputed by any Taxing authority, the
                  party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly notify
                  the other parties hereto of such dispute and the parties
                  hereto shall consult with each other concerning resolution
                  of the dispute.

         Section 34. Section 6.29 is amended by deleting the reference to
"U.S. $750 million" and replacing it with "Cash Payment".

         Section 35. Article VI of the Acquisition Agreement is amended to add,
immediately following Section 6.31, new Sections 6.32, 6.33, 6.34, 6.34 and
6.35 as set forth below:

                           6.32 Cross-License Agreement. Buyer and Seller agree
                  that the provisions of Section 4.5 of the Cross-License
                  Agreement relating to the consequences of an action for patent
                  infringement brought by Seller or any of its SUBSIDIARIES (as
                  defined in the Cross-License Agreement) against Micron
                  Electronics, Inc. ("MEI") and/or Micron Communications, Inc.
                  ("MCC") shall remain applicable in the event such action is
                  brought against any successor in interest to all or
                  substantially all of the business and patents of MEI or MCC,
                  as the case may be.

                           6.33     Certain Technology Agreements.

                           (a) Seller represents that it is a party to
                  agreements, dated December 9, 1988, November 15, 1991 and May
                  1, 1995 with Hitachi ("GT Projects"), agreements, dated
                  January 30, 1997 and December 25, 1997 between Seller, Hitachi
                  and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation ("Orion Project"), a
                  License and Technical Assistance Agreement, dated December 19,
                  1997, between Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and Seller
                  ("Project M"), and an agreement, dated August 1, 1989 between
                  Seller, Universita' degli Studi dell'Aquila and European
                  Engineering and Technologies ("Eagle Consortium"), each
                  relating to the development and manufacture of semiconductor
                  products. To the extent intellectual property has resulted
                  from the sole and/or joint activities of the parties to each
                  of the foregoing agreements, Seller and Buyer desire now to
                  clarify Buyer's rights and Seller's obligations with respect
                  to such intellectual property as follows, without limiting or
                  diminishing any rights or licenses granted by other agreements
                  between Buyer and Seller:

                                    (i) Seller hereby grants to Buyer and its
                           Subsidiaries a perpetual, non-exclusive,
                           royalty-free, worldwide license under any know how,
                           trade secret, copyright and mask work rights
                           arising out of or transferred to Seller pursuant
                           to the Eagle Consortium as to which Seller and/or
                           any of its Subsidiaries ever had, acquired, or
                           presently have a right to use, such license to
                           grant rights to Buyer to develop, manufacture, have
                           manufactured, use, sell, import or otherwise
                           dispose of semiconductor products for the
                           respective lives of the know-how, trade secret,
                           copyright, and mask work rights.

                                    (ii) Seller hereby grants to Buyer and its
                           Subsidiaries a perpetual, non-exclusive,
                           royalty-free, worldwide license of maximum scope
                           (except that such license shall be non-exclusive),
                           including sublicensing rights, which Seller is
                           permitted to grant to Buyer under the "Termination
                           Agreement of GT Agreements," dated September 28,
                           1998, "Termination Agreement of Orion Agreements,"
                           dated September 29, 1998, or "Memorandum on
                           Termination of License and Technical Assistance
                           Agreement," dated September 29, 1998, respectively,
                           as to any know how, trade secret, copyright and mask
                           work rights arising out of or transferred to Seller
                           pursuant to the GT Projects, the Orion Project, or
                           Project M, respectively, such license to grant rights
                           to Buyer to develop, manufacture, have manufactured,
                           use, sell, import or otherwise dispose of
                           semiconductor products for the respective lives of
                           the know-how, trade secret, copyright, and mask work
                           rights.

                                    (iii) With respect to patents jointly owned
                           by Seller arising out of the GT Projects or the Orion
                           Project, Seller agrees that it will not consent to
                           any licensing framework for any such joint patent
                           that would allow any party to license or enforce such
                           joint patent to or against Buyer on terms that would
                           require Buyer to pay or offer any consideration of
                           any kind in exchange for such license. The terms
                           "joint patents" and "licensing framework" shall
                           have the meaning ascribed to them in the agreements
                           relating to the GT Projects and the Orion Project.

                           (b) Seller represents and warrants that there are no
                  patents, pending applications for patent, or disclosures
                  which will result in applications for patent arising out
                  of or resulting from Project M that are jointly owned by
                  Seller and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation.

                           (c) Seller agrees that any patent(s) arising out of
                  or resulting from the Eagle Consortium shall be considered
                  "TI PATENTS" as that term is used in the Cross-License
                  Agreement, attached as Exhibit C to the Acquisition
                  Agreement.

                           (d) Notwithstanding any other indemnity provision in
                  this Agreement or any agreement or amendment associated with
                  this Agreement, and not subject to any limitations on any
                  other indemnity provision in this Agreement or any agreement
                  or amendment associated with this Agreement, Seller agrees to
                  indemnify, defend and hold Buyer and any Buyer subsidiary,
                  including their respective directors, officers, employees and
                  agents harmless with respect to any claim that any
                  manufacture, use, sale, offer to sell or importation of any
                  product, any combination of such product with any other
                  hardware and/or software, any method or process used in the
                  manufacture or testing of such product, or any tools or
                  equipment used for accomplishing any of the foregoing
                  infringes (a) any know how, trade secret, copyright or mask
                  work rights of the Eagle Consortium to which Buyer received
                  a license under subparagraph 1, above, (b) any Joint Patent
                  arising out of the GT Projects or the Orion Project, or (c)
                  any patent arising out of or resulting from the Eagle
                  Consortium. This indemnity shall apply regardless of whether
                  such claim is brought by Hitachi, Mitsubishi, parties to the
                  Eagle Consortium, or any successor in interest to any
                  intellectual property identified in (a), (b) and (c) herein.
                  Seller agrees to pay all costs, expenses and fees arising out
                  of defense and investigation of such claim, including any and
                  all damages award or settlement amount resulting therefrom.
                  In the event an injunction is obtained against activities of
                  Buyer or its subsidiaries, Seller shall use all commercially
                  reasonable efforts to procure for Buyer the right to continue
                  the activities which resulted in the claim.

                           6.34 Transfers of Acquired Intellectual Property.
                  To permit Buyer to specifically document the assignment of
                  specific items of Intellectual Property transferred to Buyer
                  as Acquired Intellectual Property, or to facilitate the
                  recordation of such assignments, the parties agree that it
                  is desirable to have specific documents of assignment.
                  Accordingly, attached hereto as Exhibit N is an "Assignment
                  of Trademarks" currently recognized to be included within
                  Acquired Intellectual Property. To the extent that additional
                  trademarks may be identified within the Acquired Intellectual
                  Property, the parties agree that an assignment in the form
                  of Exhibit N may be utilized to document such assignment.
                  Similarly, attached hereto as Exhibit O is a "Form of
                  Copyright Assignment" which the parties agree is appropriate
                  for use to document the assignment(s) of Copyrights included
                  within Acquired Intellectual Property, as agreed upon by the
                  parties subsequent to Closing.

                           6.35 Backlog. Backlog of DRAM products on the books
                  of the Seller Group as of the Closing Date and scheduled for
                  delivery to any Seller Group customer (other than
                  distributors) within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date
                  shall, to the extent such commitments were entered into in the
                  normal course of the Business consistent with past practices,
                  become backlog of Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries, which
                  shall honor applicable price, quantities and delivery dates;
                  provided that if Buyer or its Subsidiary reasonably determines
                  that price, quantities, delivery dates, credit or payment
                  terms associated with such backlog are not consistent with its
                  customary policies and Buyer or its Subsidiary is unable to
                  negotiate acceptable terms with such customer, Buyer or its
                  Subsidiary may reject such backlog. Backlog scheduled for
                  delivery to, and DRAM inventory held at, the common
                  distributors designated in the letter agreements attached
                  hereto as Exhibit P shall be treated in accordance with the
                  provisions of such letter agreements. The Seller Group shall
                  exercise commercially reasonable efforts to avoid scheduling
                  backlog for delivery within five (5) Business Days of the
                  Closing Date.

                  Section 36. Section 6.6 of the Acquisition Agreement is
amended by deleting Section 6.6 in its entirety and by replacing it with the
following:

                           6.6  Italian Operations.

                           (a) Buyer shall cause employment levels in Italian
                  Newco to remain substantially equivalent to the level of
                  employment as of the Closing Date for a period commencing on
                  the Closing Date and terminating on the earlier to occur of
                  (x) the publication in the Italian Official Gazette of a CIPE
                  resolution stating that investment under the 1989 Program
                  Contract is complete (the "Publication Date") or (y) 18 months
                  after the Closing Date; provided, however, that Italian Newco
                  shall be entitled to terminate Italian Newco employees for
                  good reason and shall be allowed to reduce employment levels
                  through Italian Newco employee attrition; provided, further,
                  that in all events Buyer shall cause Italian Newco to maintain
                  levels of employment consistent with the minimum requirements
                  under the 1989 Program Contract (i.e. 1,270 employees) during
                  such period. Buyer shall cause employment levels in Italian
                  Newco to remain at least equal to the Required Employment
                  Levels as in effect from time to time for a period commencing
                  on the earlier of (i) the Publication Date and (ii) 18 months
                  after the Closing Date and terminating 30 months from the
                  Closing Date. The restrictions in this Section 6.6(a) shall
                  not apply to Buyer or any of its affiliates to the extent
                  Buyer or its affiliates obtain appropriate approvals from
                  competent Italian Governmental Agencies permitting or
                  otherwise authorizing the reduction or elimination of the
                  Required Employment Levels but only to the extent of such
                  reduction or elimination. For purposes of this Agreement,
                  "Required Employment Levels" means, on any particular date,
                  the number of Italian employees that Italian Newco is required
                  to employ at such date in accordance with the Ministerial
                  Decrees issued by the Italian Ministry of Treasury, Budget and
                  Economic Programming in connection with subsidies granted
                  under the 1989 Program Contract.

                           (b) Buyer shall not sell or dispose of any item of
                  Restricted Equipment for a period commencing on the Closing
                  Date and terminating on the earlier to occur of (x) the
                  Equipment Restriction Expiration Date for that particular item
                  of Restricted Equipment or (y) thirty (30) months after the
                  Closing Date, unless Buyer replaces such Restricted Equipment
                  with equipment more technologically advanced and with greater
                  book value; provided, however, that in no event shall any
                  restriction extend beyond 30 months; provided, further, that
                  the restrictions in this Section 6.6(b) shall not apply to
                  Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to any item of Restricted
                  Equipment to the extent Buyer or its Affiliates obtains
                  approval in accordance with Article 8 of the Gaspari Decree
                  permitting such sale or disposition. For purposes of this
                  Agreement, (A) "Restricted Equipment" means equipment
                  constituting Acquired Assets subject to use restrictions under
                  Article 8 of the Gaspari Decree, and (B) "Equipment
                  Restriction Expiration Date" means, with respect to any item
                  of Restricted Equipment, the date on which the restrictions
                  under Article 8 of the Gaspari Decree lapse or otherwise
                  become inapplicable to such item of Restricted Equipment.

                           (c) For a period commencing on the Closing Date and
                  terminating on the earlier to occur of (x) the Facility
                  Restriction Expiration Date for any particular Restricted
                  Facility Portion or (y) 30 months after the Closing Date,
                  Buyer shall use such Restricted Facility Portion for the
                  manufacture of electronics products at levels of activity that
                  in the aggregate are substantially consistent with activity
                  levels at the Closing Date, taking into account the
                  contemplated conversion of the 6-inch line to the 8-inch line
                  and the implementation of new technology provided, however,
                  that in no event shall any restriction extend beyond 30
                  months; provided, further, that the restrictions in this
                  Section 6.6(c) shall not apply to Buyer or any of its
                  Affiliates with respect to any Restricted Facility Portion to
                  the extent Buyer or its Affiliates obtain approval in
                  accordance with Article 8 of the Gaspari Decree eliminating
                  the restrictions with respect to that Restricted Facility
                  Portion. For purposes of this Agreement, (A) "Restricted
                  Facility Portion" means each portion of the facility located
                  at Avezzano, Italy constituting Acquired Assets subject to the
                  use restrictions under Article 8 of the Gaspari Decree, and
                  (B) "Facility Restriction Expiration Date" means, with respect
                  to each Restricted Facility Portion, the date on which all
                  restrictions under Article 8 of the Gaspari Decree lapse or
                  otherwise become inapplicable to such Restricted Facility
                  Portion.

                           (d) In determining (i) the Required Employment Levels
                  applicable from time to time, (ii) the Equipment Restriction
                  Expiration Date with respect to any item of Restricted
                  Equipment, and (iii) the Facility Restriction Expiration Date
                  with respect to any Restricted Facility Portion for purposes
                  of this Section 6.6, Buyer shall be entitled to rely on the
                  books and records included in the Acquired Assets relating to
                  the operations at Avezzano, and Buyer's good faith
                  determination thereof shall be conclusive and binding. Buyer
                  shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, retain such books
                  and records and afford Seller and its representatives access
                  thereto in accordance with Section 6.28.

                           (e) Seller shall cause all bank Liens on the Acquired
                  Assets in Italy arising with respect to the indebtedness
                  described in item 1 of Exhibit J hereto (the "Avezzano Debt")
                  to be fully released within six months from the Closing Date
                  and in no event shall any such Liens constitute Permitted
                  Liens notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
                  herein or in the Seller Disclosure Letter.

                           (f) If at any time prior to the date 30 months
                  following the Closing Date, the Italian government fails to
                  pay interest subsidies in respect of the Avezzano Debt when
                  due or within any applicable grace periods, Buyer shall pay
                  Seller or its designee, promptly on demand, (x) 50% of any
                  additional interest Seller or any of its Affiliates is
                  required to pay as a result thereof, and (y), without
                  duplication, 50% of any amounts paid by Seller of any of its
                  Affiliates in connection with the prepayment or acceleration
                  of the Avezzano Debt, provided that the aggregate amount
                  payable by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.6(f) shall not
                  exceed $30 million.

                           (g) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
                  provide to the Italian Ministry of Treasury, Budget and
                  Economic Programming reasonable access to their facilities,
                  books, records, auditors, employees and agents in order to
                  allow the completion of any verification and audits relating
                  to the 1989 Program Contract.

                  and warranties, that particular subsection) as to which each
                  disclosure schedule included therein relates and, to the
                  extent any disclosure schedule included therein relates to
                  more than one Section (or more than one representation and
                  warranty), then such disclosure schedule shall include a
                  specific cross-reference to the other Sections (or other
                  representations and warranties) to which such disclosure
                  schedule relates.

         Section 39. Section 6.25 of the Acquisition Agreement is amended by
adding the following language at the end thereof:

                           (e) Buyer hereby agrees to waive any claim that Buyer
                  may have against Seller arising out of: (i) Seller's
                  manufacture and sale of Low Density Flash, EPROM, Field Memory
                  or PTEC products (collectively "Waived Products"), (ii)
                  Seller's sale of products fabricated based upon Flash-type
                  EPROM Wafers-in-Process originating in Seller's Avezzano
                  facility on or before the Closing Date (including completed
                  devices in inventory); and (iii) Seller's sale of 1 Meg and 4
                  Meg DRAM devices in inventory as of the Closing Date, not to
                  exceed 350,000 devices total ("DRAM" in this subsection (iii)
                  shall not include Field Memory), where such claim is based on
                  a violation of the Covenant Not to Compete in Section 6.25 of
                  this Agreement. To the extent the manufacture or sale of any
                  product is permitted by the foregoing waiver (i.e., such
                  product is a Waived Product; a Flash-type EPROM under
                  subsection (ii) above; or a DRAM under subsection (iii)
                  above), such product shall be deemed a Licensed Product under
                  the Cross License Agreement attached as Exhibit C to this
                  Agreement. This waiver shall apply without regard to the
                  fabrication facility utilized by Seller in the manufacture
                  of Waived Products, provided that Seller has an ownership
                  interest either directly or through a wholly owned
                  subsidiary in any such fabrication facility so utilized
                  of fifty percent (50%) or more.

                           (f) Seller shall have the right to transfer to a
                  third party the entirety of its manufacturing operations
                  relating to any one of the Waived Products (whether or not
                  equipment or facilities are included in such transfer), and
                  in connection with such transfer Seller shall transfer or
                  terminate its contractual commitments, relating to such Waived
                  Products; and, without otherwise diminishing the provisions
                  of Section 6.15, in the event of such transfer as to a Waived
                  Product, Buyer grants to Seller the right to sublicense to
                  such transferee Acquired Intellectual Property that is
                  licensed to Seller pursuant to Section 6.15(b) and that is
                  directly related to and used in the manufacturing of such
                  Waived Product, the scope of such sublicense being strictly
                  limited to the manufacturing of such Waived Product.

                           (g) The waiver provided in this Section is personal
                  to Seller, and in the event of such transfer, Buyer's waiver
                  described herein shall terminate and shall subsequently be
                  void as to such Waived Product. Nothing in the preceding
                  sentence shall limit any sublicense rights granted in
                  subsection (f) above.

                           (h) Except as expressly waived in this Section, the
                  provisions of the Covenant not to Compete of Section 6.25
                  remain undiminished and in full force and effect. Seller
                  agrees that Buyer's granting of the limited waiver and limited
                  right to sublicense in this Section shall not be considered to
                  or deemed to in any way establish any course of dealing
                  between the parties; and further agrees that Buyer shall not
                  in any way be obligated to grant any further waiver under the
                  Covenant not to Compete or any further right to sublicense
                  under Section 6.15(b) in the future.

                           (i) For purposes of this Section, the following
                  definitions shall apply:

                                    "Low Density Flash" as used herein shall

                           accomplished through exposure to ultraviolet light;
                           EPROM shall not include "Flash-type EPROM" memory
                           products.

                                    "Flash-type EPROM" (also known as
                           "Flash-type EEPROM") shall mean non volatile,
                           reprogrammable memory devices in which the storage
                           cells include a floating gate, and in which erasure
                           of the storage cells is achieved through application
                           of electrical current.

                                    "Field Memory" shall mean an application
                           specific DRAM-based memory product specifically
                           designed for use in consumer electronics applications
                           and having dual I/O ports offering independent and
                           asynchronous serial read/write with limited or no
                           random accessing capabilities of the types
