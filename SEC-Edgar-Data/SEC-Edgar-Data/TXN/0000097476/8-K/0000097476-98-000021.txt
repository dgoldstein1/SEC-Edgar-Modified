Micron Completes Acquisition of TI's Memory Business

DALLAS (October 1, 1998) -- Micron Technology, Inc. (NYSE: MU) and Texas
Instruments Incorporated (NYSE: TXN) today announced the completion of the
sale of TI's memory business to Micron, including TI's wholly owned fabs in
Avezzano, Italy and Richardson, Texas, its joint venture interests in Japan
and Singapore, and an assembly and test operation in Singapore.

Under the terms of the agreement, TI received approximately 28.9 million
shares of Micron common stock valued at $881 million as of the closing date,
$740 million in notes convertible into an additional 12 million shares of
Micron common stock, and a $210 million subordinated note.  The market value
of the 6.5 percent convertible and subordinated notes is approximately $836
million.

In addition to TI's memory assets, Micron received $550 million in proceeds
from financing provided by TI to facilitate the deployment of Micron's
technology throughout the acquired business.  As part of the transaction,
Micron also received a 10 year royalty-free cross license agreement.  The
proceeds are less than previously announced as TI agreed to retain its Italian
government-sponsored debt.

TI expects a before-tax gain of approximately $100 million on the sale, which
will be deferred until the repayment of the TI-provided financing.
"The capacity of the wholly-owned and joint venture facilities, combined with
our leading-edge technology and manufacturing efficiencies, should position
Micron well for future market opportunities," said Steve Appleton, chairman,
CEO and president of Micron.  "We will immediately begin transferring our
technology to these operations, with the expectation that it will require
three to six quarters to implement."

"With this sale, we're turning the page on TI history and taking the last
major step in transitioning to primarily a pure-play digital signal processing
and analog provider," said Tom Engibous, chairman, president and chief
executive officer of Texas Instruments.

In connection with the sale, TI has agreed to guarantee the payment
obligations of one of its former joint ventures under a newly-syndicated $450
million principal amount credit facility.  At this time, the joint venture has
borrowed $210 million under the credit facility.  As a result of the
guarantee, TI has been granted a security interest in the joint venture's
assets.  In addition, the guarantee is partially offset by certain contingent
funding obligations of the joint venture shareholders.
