News Release
C-99024

               Cross-License Agreement Expected to Bring
             More Than $1 Billion to TI Over Next 10 Years;

             Agreement Follows Jury Decision that Validates
                   Strength and Breadth of TI Patents

Dallas (May 23, 1999) - Texas Instruments said today it signed a 10-year
cross-license agreement with Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., the world's
second largest producer of memory chips.  Based on projected Hyundai
integrated circuit revenues over the term of the agreement, TI expects to
receive royalty payments of more than $1 billion.  This agreement comprehends
the planned merger between Hyundai and LG Semicon Co. Ltd.

The cross-license agreement follows a jury trial in U.S. District Court for
the Eastern District of Texas that was concluded in March 1999 in TI's favor.
In that trial, the jury found that TI's patents were valid and that Hyundai
willfully infringed them.

TI had been working to negotiate a cross-license agreement with Hyundai since
1997, when a previous agreement between the companies expired.  After
negotiations failed, TI filed patent infringement cases against Hyundai in May
1998 in the United States, Great Britain, France, Germany, The Netherlands and
Japan.  With the new agreement, all remaining litigation between TI and
Hyundai is settled.  The agreement is retroactive to November 1997 and will
expire at the end of 2007.

The royalties to be paid by Hyundai over the life of this new agreement are
significantly more than those paid under the previous agreement.  "The jury
decision and the subsequent settlement are indicative of the strength of TI's
portfolio of more than 6,000 patents," said Richard J. Agnich, senior vice
president and general counsel of Texas Instruments.  "These patents have
resulted from billions of dollars of R&D investments over many years.  We'll
license our technology, but we won't give it away."

The patents highlighted in the federal court trial were only two of a number
of patents in TI's portfolio that were involved in the litigation with
Hyundai.  These patents, known as the "Head Patents" after TI inventor Claude
Head, cover the intelligent transfer of work within an asynchronously
automated assembly line and are considered essential to the efficient
operation of modern automated wafer fabrication facilities.

TI expects to accrue approximately $86 million in the second quarter of 1999
for catch-up royalties due under the new agreement, including $27 million for
the first quarter of 1999.  Net of resulting expense and taxes, the catch-up
payment is expected to add about $0.12 to TI's earnings per share in the
second quarter.  This earnings-per-share amount is based on the number of
shares outstanding as of March 31, 1999.
