                                  PART I


ITEM 1.     Business. 

General
- -------
            Texas Instruments Incorporated (hereinafter the "Registrant,"
including subsidiaries except where the context indicates otherwise) is
engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a variety of products
in the electrical and electronics industry for industrial, government and
consumer markets.  These products consist of components, defense
electronics and digital products.  The Registrant also produces metallurgical
materials. In addition, the Registrant s patent portfolio has been established
as an ongoing contributor to the Registrant s revenues.  The Registrant's
business is based principally on its broad semiconductor technology and
application of this technology to selected electronic end-equipment
markets. The Registrant from time to time considers acquisitions and
divestitures which may alter its business mix.  The Registrant may effect
one or more such transactions at such time or times as the Registrant
determines to be appropriate.  

            The information with respect to net revenues, profit and
identifiable assets of the Registrant's industry segments and operations
outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the financial
statements captioned "Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations" on
pages 37-38 of the Registrant's 1994 annual report to stockholders, is
incorporated herein by reference to such annual report. 

Components
- ----------
            Components consist of semiconductor integrated circuits (such
as microprocessors/microcontrollers, applications processors, memories, and
digital and linear circuits), semiconductor discrete devices, semiconductor
subassemblies (such as custom modules for specific applications), and
electrical and electronic control devices (such as motor protectors, starting
relays, circuit breakers, thermostats, sensors, and radio-frequency
identification systems).

            These components are used in a broad range of products for
industrial end-use (such as computers, data terminals and peripheral
equipment, telecommunications, instrumentation, and industrial motor controls
and automation equipment), consumer end-use (such as televisions, cameras,
automobiles, home appliances, and residential air conditioning and heating
systems) and government end-use (such as defense and space equipment). The
Registrant sells these components primarily to original equipment
manufacturers principally through its own marketing organizations and to a
lesser extent through distributors. 

Defense Electronics
- -------------------
            Defense electronics consist of radar systems, navigation systems,
infrared surveillance and fire control systems, defense suppression missiles,
other weapon systems (including antitank and interdiction weapons), missile
guidance and control systems, electronic warfare systems, and other defense
electronic equipment.  Sales are made to the U.S. government (either directly
or through prime contractors) and to international customers approved by the
U.S. government.
                                     
                                  2 

<PAGE>
Digital Products
- ----------------
            Digital products include software productivity tools, notebook
computers, printers, electronic calculators, and custom engineering and
manufacturing services.

            Digital products are used in a broad range of enterprise-wide,
work group and personal information-based applications.  The Registrant
markets these products through various channels, including system suppliers,
business equipment dealers, distributors, retailers, and direct sales to end-
users and original equipment manufacturers.

Metallurgical Materials
- -----------------------
            Metallurgical materials include clad metals, precision-engineered
parts and electronic connectors for use in a variety of applications such as
appliances, automobiles, electronic components, and industrial and
telecommunications equipment.  These metallurgical materials are primarily
sold directly to original equipment manufacturers.  This segment also includes
development costs associated with solar cells; the Registrant has announced
its intention to sell its solar cell technology.

Competition
- -----------
            The Registrant is engaged in highly competitive businesses.  Its
competitors include several of the largest companies in the United States,
East Asia, particularly Japan, and elsewhere abroad as well as many small,
specialized companies.  The Registrant is a significant competitor in each of
its principal businesses.  Generally, the Registrant's businesses are
characterized by rapidly changing technology which has, throughout the
Registrant's history, intensified the competitive factors, primarily
performance and price. 

Government Sales
- ----------------
            Net revenues directly from federal government agencies in the
United States, principally related to the defense electronics segment,
accounted for approximately 10% of the Registrant's net revenues in 1994.

            Contracts for government sales generally contain provisions for
cancellation at the convenience of the government.  In addition, companies
engaged in supplying military equipment to the government are dependent on
congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, and may be
affected by changes in government policies resulting from various military and
political developments.  See "ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings."

Backlog
- -------
            The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by the Registrant
to be firm was $3913 million as of December 31, 1994 and $3805 million as of
December 31, 1993.  Approximately 24% of the 1994 backlog (involving defense
electronics) is not expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.  The
backlog is significant in the business of the Registrant only as an indication
of future revenues which may be entered on the books of account of the
Registrant. 
 
                                   3


<PAGE>
Raw Materials
- -------------
            The Registrant purchases materials, parts and supplies from a
number of suppliers.  In addition, the Registrant produces some materials,
parts and supplies, such as silicon wafers used in the manufacture of
semiconductors, for its own use.  The materials, parts and supplies essential
to the Registrant's business are generally available at present and the
Registrant believes at this time that such materials, parts and supplies will
be available in the foreseeable future.

Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
            The Registrant owns many patents in the United States and other
countries in fields relating to its businesses.  The Registrant has developed
a strong, broad-based patent portfolio.  The Registrant also has several
agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that
other licenses may be negotiated in the future.  The Registrant does not
consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent
license, although taken as a whole, the rights of the Registrant and the
products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to the
Registrant's business.  As noted above, the Registrant's patent portfolio has
been established as an ongoing contributor to the revenues of the Registrant. 
See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations" and "ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings."

            The Registrant owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its
business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which
are "Texas Instruments" and the Registrant's corporate monogram.

Research and Development
- ------------------------
            Expenditures for research and development were $1045 million in
1994 compared with $981 million in 1993 and $891 million in 1992.  Of these
amounts, $689 million was company funded in 1994, ($590 million in 1993 and
$470 million in 1992), and $356 million in 1994 ($391 million in 1993 and $421
million in 1992) was funded by others, principally the U.S. government.

Seasonality
- -----------
            The Registrant's revenues are subject to some seasonal variation.

Employees
- ---------
            The information concerning the number of persons employed by the
Registrant at December 31, 1994 on page 41 of the Registrant's 1994 annual
report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual
report.

            The Registrant's facilities in the United States contained
approximately 18,500,000 square feet as of December 31, 1994, of which
approximately 4,400,000 square feet were leased.  The Registrant's facilities
outside the United States contained approximately 6,500,000 square feet as of
December 31, 1994, of which approximately 1,600,000 square feet were leased. 

            The Registrant believes that its existing properties are in good
condition and suitable for the manufacture of its products. The Registrant's
facility in Denton, Texas is being marketed for sale.  Otherwise, at the end
of 1994, the Registrant utilized substantially all of the space in its
facilities. 

            Leases covering the Registrant's leased facilities expire at
varying dates generally within the next 15 years.  The Registrant anticipates
no difficulty in either retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-
month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or replacing the leased
facilities with equivalent facilities.






                                      5

ITEM 3.     Legal Proceedings.

            On July 19, 1991, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District
Court against Fujitsu Limited ( Fujitsu ) seeking injunctive relief, alleging
that Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of certain DRAMs infringe the Registrant's
Japanese patent on the invention of the integrated circuit (the  Kilby 
patent).  Concurrently, Fujitsu brought a lawsuit in the same court against
the Registrant, seeking a declaration that Fujitsu is not infringing the Kilby
patent. On August 31, 1994, the district court ruled that Fujitsu's production
of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K EPROMs does not infringe the Kilby
patent.  The Registrant has appealed the court's decision to the Tokyo High
Court.

            The Registrant is included among a number of U.S. defense
contractors which are currently the subject of U.S. government investigations
regarding alleged procurement irregularities.  The Registrant is unable to
predict the outcome of the investigations at this time or to estimate the
kinds or amounts of claims or other actions that could be instituted against
the Registrant.  Under present government procurement regulations, such
investigations could lead to a government contractor's being suspended or
debarred from eligibility for awards of new government contracts for an
initial period of up to three years.  In the current environment, even
matters that seem limited to disputes about contract interpretation can result
in criminal prosecution.  While criminal charges against contractors have
resulted from such investigations, the Registrant does not believe such
charges would be appropriate in its case and has not, at any time, lost its
eligibility to enter into government contracts or subcontracts under these
regulations.

            The Registrant is involved in various investigations and
proceedings conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and
certain state environmental agencies regarding disposal of waste materials.
Although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters
differ, the Registrant believes that in each case its liability will be
limited to sharing clean-up or other remedial costs with other potentially
responsible parties, in amounts that will not have a material adverse effect
upon its financial position or results of operations.

   Sec. 3-1.  Compensation Deferrals.  Payment of the portion of the
Participant's Compensation elected by the Participant's Deferred Compensation
Agreement will be deferred by TI or its subsidiaries until such later time as
the Participant may elect in accordance with the provisions of Article II. 
Compensation deferral pursuant to an election by a Participant shall commence
the first month of the Plan Year immediately following the Election Period in
which the election was made. 
 
   Sec. 3-2. Interest on Amounts Deferred.  Amounts deferred hereunder shall
earn interest during each Plan Year until further action by the Compensation
Committee at an annual rate of interest equal to the Moody's Corporate Aaa
Bond Yield Average as of September 30 of the preceding year.  Such rate of
interest may be changed prospectively for any Plan Year by the Compensation
Committee in its sole and absolute discretion.  In lieu of establishing a 
specific rate of interest, the Compensation Committee may specify the manner
in which interest to be earned hereunder is to be determined for each Plan
Year.  Such interest rate shall be applied to the balance in the Participant's
account on the last day of each month and interest at such rate will be credited
as of the end of each month.  Deferred amounts plus accrued interest shall
continue to accrue interest until fully  distributed.  No interest shall be
paid on amounts withdrawn or distributed prior to the date on which interest 
is credited.  
 
   Sec. 3-3. Withdrawal of Amounts Deferred.   During any Plan Year a 
Participant may withdraw up to 100% of his or her account balance existing as
of December 31 of the immediately preceding Plan Year.  A Participant who makes
an election to withdraw any amount shall forfeit 10% of the amount withdrawn. 
Distribution of withdrawals shall be made as soon as practicable after the
request for withdrawal is received by the Plan Administrator, except that
amounts deferred in the immediately preceding Plan Year will not be paid
before March 16.  All forfeited amounts shall be removed from the
Participant's account balance and shall be retained by TI. 
    
   Sec. 3-4. Maintenance and Distribution of Participant's Accounts.  (a)  TI
shall maintain for each Participant an unfunded account of the amounts
deferred hereunder together with the interest credited thereon, less any
withdrawals and forfeitures, until such time following the Termination of
Employment or Retirement of the Participant as all amounts have been
distributed in accordance with the provisions of this Article III.  TI shall
maintain records of all accounts of Participants and such other records and data
as may be necessary and appropriate for the proper administration of the Plan
and to determine the amounts distributable to Participants and beneficiaries.   
 
   (b)  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Plan:  
 
   (i) The Compensation Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may 
   require that a lump sum distribution of all deferred amounts plus
   accrued interest be made to any Participant promptly following such
   Participant's Termination of Employment or Retirement if the Participant
   thereafter becomes affiliated with a governmental agency or with any
   private company or firm which the Compensation Committee believes to be in
   competition with TI.
 
   (ii)  In the event of a Change in Control, distribution of the accounts of
   all Participants shall be made in a lump sum no later than the month
   following the month during which such Change in Control occurred. 
 
   (iii) In the event of the death of a Participant prior to the receipt of
   the full amount to be distributed to the Participant, all remaining 
   amounts will be distributed to the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by
   the Participant in such manner and form as the Plan Administrator shall
   specify, or, if there is no beneficiary so designated or if none of the
   beneficiaries survive the Participant, to the Participant's estate, as soon
   as practicable following the month in which the death occurred. 
 
   Sec. 3-5. Time of Distribution.  (a)  Distributions of amounts in a
Participant's account shall commence on or before the last day of the month
immediately following the month in which the Participant's Retirement or
Termination of Employment occurs, provided that:   
 
   (i) distributions of amounts deferred in the Plan Year prior to the Plan
   Year in which the Participant's Retirement or Termination of Employment
   occurs shall not commence before March 16 of the Plan Year in which the
   Retirement or Termination of Employment occurs;  
    
   (ii) distributions of amounts deferred during the Plan Year in which a 
   Participant's Retirement or Termination of Employment occurs shall not
   commence before March 16 of the Plan Year immediately following that
   Plan Year; and 
 
   (iii) a lump sum distribution elected by a Participant in accordance with
   the provisions of Section 2-4(c) hereof may, if so elected by the 
   Participant, be paid on or after March 16 of the Plan Year following the Plan
   Year in which the Participant's Retirement or Termination of Employment
   occurred. 
 
   (b)  Annual installments subsequent to the first installment of a
Participant's distribution shall be paid as of March 31 of each Plan Year
until the Participant's account balance is fully distributed. 
 
   (c)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3-5, the amount
of the distribution pursuant to paragraph (a) above during the Plan Year in
which the Participant's Termination or Retirement of Employment occurs shall
not, when combined with such Participant's other remuneration paid by TI
and TI subsidiaries for such Plan Year, exceed the amount that is deductible
for such year by TI for Federal income tax purposes  pursuant to Section 162(m)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  Any amount not distributed
during a Plan Year pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be distributed in
March of the following Plan Year. 
 
   Sec. 3-6. Taxes.  TI makes no guarantees and assumes no obligation or 
responsibility with respect to the Participant's Federal, state, or local
income, estate, inheritance or gift tax obligations, if any, under this Plan
or any Deferred Compensation Agreement.
 
   Sec. 3-7. No Assignment; Nonalienation of Benefits.  No Participant or 
beneficiary of a Participant shall have any right to assign, alienate,
encumber, sell, pledge, hypothecate, anticipate, charge or in any way
create a lien on any amounts payable hereunder.  No amounts payable hereunder
shall be subject to assignment or transfer or otherwise be alienable, either by
voluntary or involuntary act, or by operation of law, or subject to
attachment, execution, garnishment, sequestration or other seizure under any
legal, equitable or other process, or be liable in any way for the debts,
defaults, contracts, liabilities, or torts of Participants or their
beneficiaries. Any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, pledge,
encumber or charge the same will be void.
 
                               ARTICLE IV   
                                  FUNDING 
 
   Sec. 4-1. Funding.  Any and all benefits under this Plan, including without 
limitation, the payment or distribution of amounts deferred hereunder, shall be 
paid solely by TI.  Benefits payable under this Plan shall be paid from the
general assets of TI and shall represent TI's unfunded and unsecured promise
to pay.  TI may create separate accounts, reserves, funds, or other
facilities and may provide for amounts to be held in trust or by custodians on
its behalf under such trust or custodial agreements as the Compensation
Committee in its absolute and sole discretion deems appropriate, but in no event
shall any Participant or beneficiary or any person claiming by, through or under
any such person have any claim to any such accounts, reserves, funds or 
acilities or the assets of any trust or custody arrangement or to any other
specific assets of TI. 
 
 
   Sec. 4-2. Creditor Status.  A Participant and his or her beneficiary or 
beneficiaries shall be nothing more than general creditors of TI with respect
to the payment of any benefit under this Plan.  
 
                                 ARTICLE V 
                        ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN 
 
   Sec. 5.1  Administration.  The Plan Administrator shall be charged with the 
administration of the Plan and shall have the power and authority as may be
necessary and appropriate for such purposes, including but not by way of

   Sec. 6-1. Amendment; Termination.  (a) TI may change, amend, modify, 
alter, or terminate the Plan at any time and in any manner except that no
amendment, modification or alteration shall be exercised retroactively to

consent of the affected Participants insofar as they relate to past deferrals,
nor shall any such amendment divest any Participant of any deferral made
prior to the amendment without the consent of the affected Participant. 
 
   (b)  TI reserves the right, in it sole discretion, to discontinue 
deferrals under a Deferred Compensation Agreement at any time.  In the event of
such discontinuance TI reserves the right to distribute to each Participant all
deferred amounts plus accrued interest at any time or times. 
 
   Sec. 6-2. Plan Not an Employment Contract.  Neither this Plan nor any
Deferred Compensation Agreement nor any other agreement hereunder
constitutes a contract foremployment or continued employment.  This Plan does
not give to any person the right to be continued in employment, and all 
Participants remain subject to changes in compensation, Compensation,
transfer, change of job, discipline, layoff, discharge or any other change of
employment status. 
 
   Sec. 6-3. Applicable Law.  The Plan shall be governed and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, except to the extent such

          (ii) that the Plan is incorporated by reference and that the Deferred
               Compensation Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of
               the Plan in all respects."

To the Stockholders of Texas Instruments 
 
Strong performance in TI's semiconductor business in 1994 produced the best 
financial results in the company's history. TI reached record levels in  
earnings per share, profits and revenues. Other contributors to TI's  
improvement were higher royalties, and increased profits in personal  
productivity products and materials and controls. For the first time, annual  
revenues surpassed $10 billion, and profit from operations surpassed $1  
billion. 
 
	Financial Summary.  TI's net revenues for 1994 were $10.3 billion, up 21 
percent from $8.5 billion in 1993, with most of the increase in  
semiconductors. Profit from operations was $1083 million in 1994, up 49  
percent from $728 million in 1993. Higher semiconductor operating profits and  
higher royalties accounted for much of the increase.

[Graphic text:  "...the best financial results in the company's history."]
 
	Results for 1994 include a profit-sharing accrual of $175 million, the 
highest in the company's history, versus $83 million in 1993. Productivity, as 
measured in revenues per person, increased 26 percent in 1994, contributing to 
TI's record amount of profit sharing. 
 
	Changes are being made in TI's worldwide profit-sharing program  
beginning in 1995. While the formula that generates the amount of profit  
sharing is unchanged, each country will have the flexibility to decide how 
payments from the program will be made. The company believes these changes  
will make the profit-sharing program more responsive and competitive,  
benefiting shareholders and TIers. 
 
	Net income for the year was $691 million, compared with $472 million for 
1993, an increase of 46 percent. Earnings per share increased 45 percent to  
$7.27, compared with $5.03 in 1993. 
 
	The company made progress in building shareholder value, as measured by 
return on invested capital. TI's return on invested capital was 19.5 percent  
in 1994, up from 14.7 percent in 1993. 
 
	Leadership Strategies for the Networked Society.  TI's second  
consecutive year of record financial performance was the result of good  
execution of strategies put in place in the late 1980s. Based on that success, 
we are now developing the strategies that will take TI into the next century. 
As highlighted later in this report, the new strategies will focus on  
developing the products and services that make it easy for people to be  
interconnected via digital technology. We believe the most significant added  
value in electronic equipment is the ability for people to form networks that  
enable them to share information more effectively. We made substantial  
progress in 1994 on products and technologies critical to the networked  
society.

	Semiconductors.  TI's semiconductor revenues grew faster than the  
industry for the third consecutive year, strengthening our position as a  
leader in the $100-billion world semiconductor market. Semiconductor revenues 
were at record levels for the fourth quarter of 1994 and for the year.  
Profits, up substantially in 1994 over 1993, also reached record levels for 
the year. Semiconductor operating margins improved in 1994, primarily because 
of increased manufacturing productivity. 
 
	Much of TI's strategic emphasis in semiconductors is focused on digital  
signal processing, one of the fastest growing opportunities in the  
semiconductor market. Digital signal processing is at the heart of many of the  
multimedia technologies, such as communications and full-motion video, that 
are critical to the digital

[Graphic text: "In 1995, we will increase our focus on...accelerating TI's
long-term profitable growth."]

revolution. TI's digital signal processor (DSP) revenues grew substantially
faster than the DSP market in 1994, with new applications in cellular 
telephones, high-density disk drives and consumer electronic equipment.
We introduced more than 40 new DSP products in 1994,  
including a Multimedia Video Processor that is being designed into  
applications ranging from teleconferencing to document processing. 
 
	TI remains the acknowledged leader in the rapidly growing digital signal 
processor market, and has a strong position in the market for mixed-signal 
devices that connect digital signals to the analog world. This strength is the 
basis for our leadership in digital signal processing solutions (DSPS),  
integrating digital signal processors, mixed-signal devices, and embedded 
software to provide higher value to our customers. 
 
	Progress continued in 1994 on programs designed to sustain semiconductor 
financial performance. Improvements in manufacturing yield and cycle time 
generated additional wafer output from existing facilities equivalent to the 
capacity of more than one major wafer-fabrication facility. 
 
	Construction of TI's most advanced semiconductor manufacturing  
facility, in Dallas, was completed ahead of schedule in December 1994, with 
initial production planned for the first half of 1995. This facility is  
designed for rapid prototyping and production of 0.35-micron advanced logic 
products. 
 
	Demand for memory remains strong, with personal computers driving much 
of the demand. TI's memory revenues grew substantially in 1994, outpacing the 
growth of the memory market. During 1994, TI and Hitachi announced plans for a 
new joint-venture wafer-fabrication facility for dynamic random-access  
memories to be built in Richardson, Texas, near Dallas. This facility will 
begin initial production in 1996. TI also announced the expansion of capacity 
at its facility in Avezzano, Italy. Capacity at the existing joint-venture 
facilities is also being expanded to meet the longer term demand for memory 
products. TI's shared investment strategy continues to support the growth of 
memory revenues by providing timely and cost-effective capacity additions,  
while reducing the effect on TI of the volatility of the memory business. 
 
	Defense Electronics.  TI's defense electronics business continues to  
meet the challenges of a smaller defense market. This business generated good 
cash flow and maintained stable margins in 1994 on lower revenues, while  
continuing to win key contracts. 
 
	During the year, TI won several new programs in next-generation night- 
vision systems. Key wins included advanced electro-optic systems for the U.S. 
Navy's Lamps helicopter and the U.S. Army's Bradley Fighting Vehicle.  
 
 
                                   4 
 
 
	Additionally, TI's Paveway III was selected for the United Kingdom's  
interdiction weapons program, and the joint venture team of TI and Martin  
Marietta received the initial low-rate production contract for the Javelin  
antitank missile developed for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps.  
 
	Software.  In 1994, TI's software business made progress strategically 
and financially. Actions initiated in early 1994 to divest non-strategic  
product areas were essentially completed by the end of the year, putting this 
business in a better position to focus on strategic opportunities. During the 
year, TI formed an alliance with Microsoft to define and market an innovative 
framework that will allow broader use of our application development tools. 
 
	Personal Productivity Products.  TI's notebook computer, calculator and 
printer business, benefiting from the consolidation of these operations that 
began in late 1993, made substantial profit improvement in 1994. We are moving 
to take advantage of new market opportunities created by our customers' need 
for mobility and connectivity in the emerging networked society. We plan to  
step up product development and marketing in 1995 to strengthen TI's position 
in these emerging markets. 
 
	Materials and Controls.  Growth in new products, combined with a  
recovery in international economies, led TI's materials and controls business 
to record revenues in 1994. Research and development spending has been  
increased for this business over the past few years to accelerate the shift to 
faster growing electronic opportunities, such as sensors and radio-frequency  
identification systems. 
 
	Summary.  TI's achievements over the last few years, and particularly in 
1994, have put the company in the best product, technology and financial 
position in recent history. 
 
	The global semiconductor industry continues its trend of sustainable  
double-digit growth with improved long-term stability. This is attributable to 
improved inventory control, reasonable additions to capacity relative to  
revenues, increased semiconductor content in electronic end equipment, and  
enhanced geographic diversification of the semiconductor market. 
 
	In this environment, TI plans to increase capital expenditures in 1995 
by 20 percent, to about $1.3 billion. TI-funded R&D increased $99 million in 
1994, to $689 million, and it will be increased again in 1995, to about $800 
million, to support targeted opportunities in advanced memory and  
microprocessors, digital signal processing solutions, and digital imaging 
technology for display and hardcopy applications. 
 
	Over the next few years, TI expects to make a major contribution to the 
critical technologies driving the digital revolution, across a broad base of 
capabilities in semiconductors, software and systems. By integrating our 
capabilities in sensing, processing, transmission, and display, we can provide 
value-added solutions that will help make our customers more competitive in 
global markets. In 1995, we will increase our focus on those opportunities  
that provide the greatest leverage across TI's businesses and technologies. 
This will lay the foundation for accelerating TI's long-term profitable  
growth.

Notes to Financial Statements 
 
Accounting Policies and Practices			 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Effective January 1, 1994, the company adopted a new accounting standard, SFAS 
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," 
which requires that cash equivalent and short-term investment debt securities 
be stated at fair value, instead of the lower of cost or fair value.  This 
adoption had no material effect on the company's financial statements.  
Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, which required 
the accrual of expected retiree health care benefit costs during the 
employees' working careers, and SFAS No. 109, which required increased  
recording of deferred income tax assets.  This resulted in a 1993 charge of 
$294 million ($3.14 per share) for SFAS No. 106 and a credit of $290 million 
($3.10 per share) for SFAS No. 109, for the cumulative effect of the  
accounting changes. 
 
	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all  
subsidiaries.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting.  With  
regard to accounts recorded in currencies other than U.S. dollars, current  
assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, other assets, current  
liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in  
effect at year end.  Inventories, property, plant and equipment and  
depreciation thereon are remeasured at historic exchange rates.  Revenue and 
expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the 
appropriate month-end rate of exchange.  Net currency exchange gains and  
losses from remeasurement and forward currency exchange contracts to hedge net 
balance sheet exposures are charged or credited on a current basis to other  
income (expense) net.  Gains and losses from forward currency exchange  
contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge specific transactions are included 
in the measurement of the related transactions. 
 
	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, current replacement cost or 
estimated realizable value.  Cost is generally computed on a currently 
adjusted standard (which approximates current average costs) or average basis. 
 
	Revenues from semiconductor and other commercial products and services 
are generally recognized as products are shipped or services are rendered.  
Revenues under long-term fixed price and fixed-price incentive contracts are 
recognized as deliveries are made or as performance targets are achieved.   
Revenues under long-term cost reimbursement contracts are recorded as costs 
are incurred and include estimated earned fees.  Royalty revenue is recognized 
by the company upon fulfillment of its contractual obligations and  
determination of a fixed royalty amount, or, in the case of ongoing royalties, 
upon sale by the licensee of royalty-bearing products, as estimated by the 
company. 
 
	Substantially all depreciation is computed by either the declining- 
balance method (primarily 150 percent declining method) or the sum-of-the- 
years-digits method.  Fully depreciated assets are written off against  
accumulated depreciation. 
 
	Earnings per common and common equivalent share are based on average  
common and common equivalent shares outstanding (95,427,322 shares, 93,605,749 
shares and 85,310,690 shares for 1994, 1993 and 1992).  Shares issuable upon 
exercise of dilutive stock options and upon conversion of dilutive convertible 
debentures and, for 1993 and 1992, conversion preferred stock are included in 
average common and common equivalent shares outstanding.  In computing per- 
share earnings, net income is reduced by $20 million and $37 million in 1993 
and 1992 for dividends accrued on preferred stock, and increased by $2 
million, $19 million and $4 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992 for interest (net 
of tax and profit sharing effect) and dividends on the convertible debentures 
and conversion preferred stock considered dilutive common stock equivalents. 
 
Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments			 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Debt securities with original maturities within three months are considered  
cash equivalents. Debt securities with original maturities beyond three months 
have remaining maturities within 13 months and are considered short-term 
investments.  These cash equivalent and short-term investment debt securities 
are available for sale and, beginning in 1994, stated at fair value, which 
approximates their specific amortized cost.  Adjustments to fair value are  
recorded as an increase or decrease in stockholders' equity.  At year-end  
1994, this adjustment was a $1 million decrease.  As of December 31, 1994,  
these debt securities consisted primarily of the following types:  U.S.  
government ($217 million), U.S. state and municipalities ($187 million),  
corporate ($434 million), and asset-backed commercial paper ($154 million). 
Gross realized and unrealized gains and losses for each of these security  
types were immaterial in 1994.  Proceeds from sales of these cash equivalent 
and short-term investment debt securities in 1994 were $75 million.

    Approximately 31% and 34% of the December 31, 1994 and 1993 inventories 
before progress billings related to long-term contracts. 
 
    Inventories related to long-term contracts are stated at actual production 
costs, including manufacturing overhead and special tooling and engineering  
costs, reduced by amounts identified with revenues recognized on units  
delivered or with progress completed.  Such inventories are reduced by  
charging any amounts in excess of estimated realizable value to cost of  
revenues.  The costs attributed to units delivered under long-term contracts 
are based on the estimated average cost of all units to be produced under  
existing contracts and are determined under the learning curve concept, which 
anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production  
techniques become more efficient through repetition.  Production costs  
included in inventories in excess of the estimated cost of in-process  
inventories (on the basis of estimated average cost of all units to be  
produced) were not material. 
 
	To secure access to additional semiconductor plant capacity, TI entered into 
four joint ventures formed to construct and operate semiconductor  
manufacturing facilities.  Upon formation of the ventures TI contributed  
technology and cash to acquire minority interests and entered into long-term 
inventory purchase commitments with each joint venture.  Under the agreements, 
TI purchases the output of the ventures at prices based upon percentage  
discounts from TI's average selling prices.  Certain co-venturers have the  
right to buy a portion of the output from TI.  Under certain circumstances, TI 
may increase its ownership and potentially acquire a majority interest in the 
ventures.  Under the ventures' financing arrangements, the venturers have  
provided certain debt and other guarantees.  At December 31, 1994 and 1993, TI 
was contingently liable for an aggregate of $46 million and $43 million of  
such guarantees.  Inventory purchases from the ventures aggregated $908  
million in 1994, $356 million in 1993 and $66 million in 1992.  Receivables 
from and payables to the ventures were $1 million and $94 million at December 
31, 1994, and $6 million and $45 million at December 31, 1993. 
 
    The primary purpose of the joint ventures is to provide semiconductor  
output for TI and other co-venturers.  As a result, TI expects to recover its  
cost of the ventures through sale of the semiconductor output, and is  
amortizing its cost of the ventures over the expected initial output period of 
3 to 5 years, and recognizing its share of any cumulative venture net losses 
in excess of amortization using the equity method of accounting.  TI  
recognized operating expense of $15 million in 1994, $27 million in 1993, and 
$3 million in 1992.  Due to the fact that dividend distributions are not  
expected to be significant in the foreseeable future, the probability of  
realization of TI's share of any venture net income is indeterminate and such 
income is not recognized.  Instead, dividends, if and when received, will  
first be credited against TI's cost of the ventures, thereafter to income.   
Compared to this amortization method, TI's net income would have been  
approximately $35 million ($.37 per share) higher in 1994, and essentially  
unchanged in 1993 and 1992, had TI recorded its simple arithmetic share of the 
ventures' net income or loss.

    The convertible subordinated debentures may be redeemed at the company's 
option at specified prices.  On September 29, 1994, $76 million of the  
debentures were redeemed at the option of the holders.  The remaining  
debentures are convertible at the holder's option into an aggregate 1,492,730 
shares of TI common stock at a common stock conversion price of $82.875 per 
share. 
 
    A portion of the coupon rates for the notes due 1999, 2001, 2003 and, 
beginning in 1994, the notes due 2007 have been swapped for commercial paper- 
based or LIBOR-based variable rates through April 1997, resulting in a 
combination of fixed plus short-term variable rates for an effective interest 
rate of approximately 9.6% and 6.4% as of December 31, 1994 and 1993. The 
notes due 1999 may be redeemed at par, at the company's option, beginning in 
July 1996.  The Italian lira mortgage notes, and related swaps, are due in  
installments through 2003.  The mortgage notes are collateralized by real  
estate and equipment. 
 
    Interest incurred on loans in 1994, 1993 and 1992 was $58 million, $55  
million and $57 million.  Of these amounts, $13 million in 1994, $8 million in 
1993 and $6 million in 1992 were capitalized as a component of capital asset 
construction costs.  Interest paid on loans (net of amounts capitalized) was  
$53 million in 1994, $54 million in 1993 and $51 million in 1992. 
 
    Aggregate maturities of long-term debt due during the four years 
subsequent to December 31, 1995, are as follows:

    Unused lines of credit for short-term financing were approximately $547  
million at December 31, 1994 and $569 million at December 31, 1993.  Of these 
amounts, $440 million and $470 million were available to support commercial  
paper borrowings. 
 
Financial Instruments and Risk Concentration 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Financial instruments:  In addition to the swaps discussed in the preceding 
note, as of December 31, 1994, the company has forward currency exchange 
contracts outstanding of $314 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures 
(including $64 million to buy yen, $47 million to buy deutsche mark, and $39 
million to buy Singapore dollars) and $116 million to hedge specific firm 
commitments for multi-year product sale transactions denominated in pound 
sterling.  At December 31, 1993, the company had forward currency exchange 
contracts outstanding of $219 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures 
(including $53 million to buy deutsche mark, $34 million to buy Singapore 
dollars, and $22 million to sell pound sterling) and $20 million to hedge 
specific firm commitments for near-term product purchase transactions 
denominated in yen.  As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the carrying amounts 
and current market settlement values of these swaps and forward contracts were 
not significant, except for the interest rate swaps for the notes due 1999,  
2001, 2003 and 2007 for which the year-end 1994 carrying amounts are a  
liability of $2 million and the settlement values are a liability of  
approximately $34 million. 
 
    The forward currency exchange contracts, including the currency interest  
rate swaps for the Italian lira mortgage notes, are used to minimize the  
adverse impacts from the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on the company's 
non-U.S. net balance sheet exposures (predominantly receivables, payables and 
accrued expenses) and specific commitments to purchase or sell products.  The 
interest rate swaps for the company's notes due 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2007 are 
used to change the characteristics of the interest rate stream on the debt 
from fixed rates to a combination of fixed plus short-term variable rates in 
order to achieve a mix of interest rates which, over time, is expected to  
moderate financing costs.  The effect of these interest rate swaps was to  
reduce interest expense by $8 million, $12 million and $9 million in 1994,  
1993 and 1992.  These interest rate swaps are sensitive to interest rate  
changes.  If short-term interest rates increase (decrease) by one percentage  
point from year-end 1994 rates, annual interest expense would increase  
(decrease) by $6 million. 
 
    In order to minimize its exposure to credit risk, the company limits its  
counterparties on the forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate  
swaps to investment-grade rated financial institutions. 
 
    As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the fair value of long-term debt, based 
on current interest rates, was approximately $830 million and $998 million,  
compared with the carrying amount of $820 million and $905 million.

                                                 32 
 
   The company has an agreement to sell, on a revolving basis, up to $175  
million of an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of 
accounts receivable, with limited recourse.  Accounts receivable are shown net 
of $125 million at December 31, 1994 and $175 million at December 31, 1993,  
representing receivables sold.  The comparable amount for December 31, 1992 is 
$175 million.  The related discount expense, which varies with commercial  
paper rates, is included in other income (expense) net.  In January 1995, the 
company reduced the outstanding balance to zero, and the agreement will be  
terminated effective January 30, 1995. 
 
Risk concentration:  Financial instruments which potentially subject the  
company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash investments and  
accounts receivable.  The company places its cash investments in investment- 
grade, short-term debt securities and limits the amount of credit exposure to 
any one commercial issuer.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the 
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers in the company's 
customer base, and their dispersion across different industries and geographic 
areas.  The company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the expected 
collectibility of all accounts receivable, including receivables sold. 
 
Stockholders' Equity 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.   
Prior to 1994, the company had three series of preferred stock outstanding:   
market auction preferred stock (average dividends declared per share:  1993 -  
$2,564;  1992 - $5,239); money market preferred stock (average dividends  
declared per share:  1993 - $2,729; 1992 - $5,138); and Series A conversion  
preferred stock.  By the end of 1993 all preferred shares had been redeemed by 
the company and none are currently outstanding. 
 
    Each outstanding share of the company's common stock carries a stock 
purchase right.  Under certain circumstances, each right may be exercised to 
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of the company's participating 
cumulative preferred stock for $200.  Under certain circumstances following 
the acquisition of 20% or more of the company's outstanding common stock by an 
acquiring person (as defined in the rights agreement), each right (other than 
rights held by an acquiring person) may be exercised to purchase common stock 
of the company or a successor company with a market value of twice the $200 
exercise price.  The rights, which are redeemable by the company at 1 cent per 
right, expire in June 1998.

Stock Options 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The company has stock options outstanding to participants under the Texas 
Instruments Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by stockholders on April 15, 
1993.  Options are also outstanding under the 1984 and 1988 Stock Option 
Plans; however, no further options may be granted under these plans.  Under 
all these stockholder-approved plans, the exercise price per share may not be 
less than 100 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant. 
Options granted become exercisable in such amounts, at such intervals and 
subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the compensation 
committee of the board of directors. 
 
    Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company may grant stock options, 
including incentive stock options; restricted stock and restricted stock  
units; performance units; and other stock-based awards, including stock  
appreciation rights.  The plan provides for the issuance of 4,000,000 shares 
of the company's common stock;  in addition, if any option under the 1984 or 
1988 Stock Option Plans terminates, then any unissued shares subject to the 
terminated option become available for granting awards under the plan.  No 
more than 1,000,000 shares of common stock may be awarded as restricted stock, 
restricted stock units or other stock-based awards under the plan. 
 
    The company also has stock options outstanding under an Employees Stock 
Option Purchase Plan approved by stockholders in 1988.  The plan provides for 
options to be offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a 
percentage of the employee's prior year's compensation.  If the optionee 
authorizes and does not cancel payroll deductions which, with interest, will 
be equal to or greater than the purchase price, options granted become 
exercisable 14 months, and expire not more than 27 months, from date of grant.

Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans 
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The company provides various incentive plans for employees, including general 
profit sharing and savings programs as well as an annual incentive plan for 
key employees.  The company also provides pension and retiree health care 
benefit plans in the U.S. and pension plans in certain non-U.S. locations. 
 
Profit sharing:  Profit sharing expense was $175 million in 1994 and $83  
million in 1993.  There was no profit sharing expense in 1992.  Under the  
plans, unless otherwise provided by local law, the company and certain of its 
subsidiaries contribute a portion of their net profits according to certain 
formulas, but not to exceed the lesser of 25% of consolidated income (as 
defined) before profit sharing and income taxes or 15% of the compensation of 
eligible participants.  Unless otherwise provided by local law, contributions  
are invested as follows.  For worldwide profit sharing earned by eligible 
participants prior to 1994, the contributions have been invested in TI common 
stock.  For profit sharing earned by U.S. employees in 1994, the contributions 
will initially be invested in TI common stock but several other investment 
options will be made available in the future for this contribution.  For 1995 
and thereafter, 50% of profit sharing earned by U.S. employees under the 
current formula will be contributed to the profit sharing plan and invested at 
the participants' option in one or more of several available investment funds 
including TI common stock; the remaining 50% will not be contributed to the 
profit sharing plan but will be paid as cash to the eligible participants.  
Similar changes are being considered for non-U.S. employees. 
 
    Except in the event of company contributions in stock, investments in TI 
common stock are made by the trustees through purchases of outstanding shares 
or through purchases of shares offered from time to time by the company.  The 
board of directors has authorized the issuance of previously unissued shares 
for purposes of the plans; 2,308,459 of such shares were available for future 
issuance at December 31, 1994. 
 
    The trustees of the profit sharing plans purchased 1,881,815 outstanding 
shares of TI common stock in 1994 (626,670 shares in 1993 and 105,688 shares 
in 1992) and 403,945 previously unissued shares in 1994 (209,464 shares in 
1993 and none in 1992) for use in the profit sharing plans and savings 
program.  As of December 31, 1994, 6,176,127 shares of TI common stock were 
allocated to profit sharing plan stock accounts of the company's employees. 
 
Savings program:  The company provides a matched savings program whereby  
U.S. employees' contributions of up to 4% of their salary are matched by the 
company at the rate of 50 cents per dollar.  Contributions are subject to  
statutory limitations.  The contributions may be invested in several  
investment funds including TI common stock.  The company's expense under this 
program was $21 million in 1994, $21 million in 1993 and $20 million in 1992.

                                                 34 
 
U.S. pension plan:  The company has a defined benefit plan covering most 
U.S. employees with benefits based on years of service and employee's 
compensation.  The plan is a career-average-pay plan which has been amended 
periodically in the past to produce approximately the same results as a final- 
pay type plan.  The board of directors of the company has expressed an intent 
to make such amendments in the future, circumstances permitting, and the 
expected effects of such amendments have been considered in calculating U.S. 
pension expense.  The company's funding policy is to contribute to the plan at 
least the minimum amount required by ERISA.  Plan assets consist primarily of 
common stock, U.S. government obligations, commercial paper and real estate.

Non-U.S. pension plans:  Retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees of the 
company is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. 
Retirement benefits are based on years of service and employee's compensation, 
generally during a fixed number of years immediately prior to retirement. 
Funding policies are based on local statutes.  Plan assets consist primarily 
of common stock, government obligations and corporate bonds.

    The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. plans reflects the  
different economic environments within the various countries.  The projected 
benefit obligations were determined using a range of assumed discount rates of 
4.75% to 8.0% in 1994 and 4.75% to 9.0% in 1993 and a range of assumed  
average long-term pay progression rates of 4.0% to 6.0% in 1994 and 4.0% to  
7.0% in 1993.  The range of assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets 
was 8.0% to 9.0%.  Accrued pension at December 31 includes approximately $83  
million in 1994

and $79 million in 1993 for two non-U.S. plans that are not funded.  Pension 
accounting rules require recognition in the balance sheet of an additional  
minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated benefit  
obligation over the fair value of the plan assets.  A corresponding amount is 
recognized as an intangible asset, not to exceed the amount of unrecognized  
prior service cost, with the balance recorded as a reduction of stockholders' 
equity.  As of December 31, 1994 and 1993, the company has recorded an  
additional non-U.S. minimum pension liability of $9 million and $24 million 
and, for 1993, an equity reduction of $10 million. 
 
Retiree health care benefit plan:  The company's U.S. employees are currently 
eligible to receive, during retirement, specified company-paid medical  
benefits.  The plan is contributory and premiums are adjusted annually.  For 
employees retiring on or after January 5, 1993, the company has specified a 
maximum annual amount per retiree, based on years of service, that it will pay 
toward retiree medical premiums.  For employees who retired prior to that  
date, the company maintains a consistent level of cost sharing between the  
company and the retiree.  The company is pre-funding the plan obligation in  
amounts determined at the discretion of management.  Plan assets consist  
primarily of common stock, U.S. government obligations, commercial paper, and 
obligations of U.S. states and municipalities. 
 
    Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'  
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which required  
the accrual of expected retiree health care benefit costs during the  
employees' working careers, instead of when the claims are incurred.  The  
company recorded an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $454  
million and a related deferred income tax asset of $160 million, which  
resulted in a 1993 charge of $294 million ($3.14 per share) for the cumulative 
effect of the accounting change.  Retiree health care benefit expense in 1992 
was computed on a claims-incurred basis. 
 
    Expense of the retiree health care benefit plan includes the following 
components:

</TABLE> 
    Retiree health care benefit amounts were determined using health care cost 
trend rates of 8.8% for 1995 decreasing to 6.0% by 1999, and assumed discount 
rates of 8.5% for 1994 and 7.0% for 1993.  Increasing the health care cost  
trend rates by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit 
obligation at December 31, 1994 by $27 million and 1994 plan expense by $2  
million.  A trust holding a portion of the plan assets is subject to federal 
income taxes at a 39.6% rate.  The assumed long-term rate of return on plan  
assets, after taxes, was 7.3%.  Retiree health care benefit expense was $24  
million in 1992. 
 
Special actions:  In the first quarter of 1994, the company took a pretax  
charge of $83 million for restructuring of its European operations from the  
traditional country-by-country approach to business centers with pan-European 
responsibilities.  This action primarily affected semiconductor activities and 
is expected to result in annual savings of approximately $54 million when 
fully implemented.  Also taken in the first quarter was a pretax charge of $49 
million for costs related to the divestiture of nonstrategic product lines,  
primarily in digital products.  The total charges of $132 million included  
non-cash asset write-downs of $31 million with the balance for expected cash 
outlays, including $62 million for severance.  The divestitures were  
essentially completed by the end of 1994.  Completion of the restructuring  
action, which has been delayed due to extended negotiations with certain  
European works councils, is expected by the fourth quarter of 1995. Of the  
total expected cash outlays, $41 million was expended during 1994 with the  
balance expected to be expended in 1995.  Of the approximately 1,000  
employees, primarily in Europe, affected by the severance actions, 383 left  
the company during 1994 with the balance expected to leave in 1995.

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations 
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The company is engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a variety 
of products in the electrical and electronics industry for industrial, 
government and consumer markets.  These products consist of components 
(semiconductors, such as integrated circuits, discrete devices and 
subassemblies, and electrical and electronic control devices); defense 
electronics (such as radar systems, navigation systems, infrared surveillance 
and fire control systems, defense suppression missiles, missile guidance and 
control systems, and electronic warfare systems); and digital products (such 
as software productivity tools, notebook computers, printers, electronic  
calculators, and custom manufacturing services).  In fourth quarter 1992, the 
company sold its commercial multiuser minicomputer systems and service  
operations, which were part of the digital products segment.  The company also 
produces metallurgical materials (including clad metals, precision-engineered 
parts and electronic connectors). 
 
    The company's business is based principally on its broad semiconductor 
technology and application of this technology to selected electronic end- 
equipment markets. 
 
    Industry segment and geographic area profit (loss) is not equivalent to 
income before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting 
changes due to exclusion of general corporate expenses, net interest, currency 
exchange gains and losses, and other items along with elimination of 
unrealized profit in assets.  Profit sharing expense is allocated to segment 
results based on payroll costs.  Prior to 1994, for geographic area purposes 
research and development expense was allocated based on revenues.  In 1994,  
research and development expense is generally reported in the geographic area 
where incurred.  The effect of this change on 1994 geographic area results was 
to decrease U.S. profits by $144 million, decrease Europe losses by $28  
million, increase East Asia profits by $113 million and increase other areas 
profit by $3 million. Royalty revenue from patent license agreements is  
included in the U.S. geographic net revenues and (except for royalty revenue 
from microcomputer system patent license agreements, which is included in the 
digital products segment) is principally included in the components segment. 
 
    Identifiable assets are those associated with segment or geographic area 
operations, excluding unallocated cash and short-term investments, internal 
company receivables and deferred income taxes.  Generally, revenues between 
industry segments and between geographic areas are based on prevailing market 
prices or an approximation thereof.

Income Taxes 
- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for 
Income Taxes," which required increased recording of deferred income tax  
assets.  As a result, the company recorded additional deferred income tax  
assets of $203 million, after a valuation allowance of $404 million, and  
reduced deferred income tax liabilities by $87 million, which resulted in a  
1993 credit of $290 million ($3.10 per share) for the cumulative effect of the 
accounting change.

    With the exception of interarea elimination of unrealized profit in  
assets, which increased $18 million in 1994, increased $1 million in 1993, and 
decreased $20 million in 1992, the remaining corporate items consist primarily 
of general corporate expenses which are applicable to both U.S. and non-U.S. 
operations.  These expenses are generally deductible for tax purposes in the 
U.S.

    Included in the effect of non-U.S. rates for 1994 is a $69 million benefit 
from tax loss carryforward utilization reduced by certain non-U.S. taxes and 
losses for which no benefit was recognized.  Provision has been made for 
deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the  
extent that dividend payments from such companies are expected to result in  
additional tax liability.  The remaining undistributed earnings (approximately 
$595 million at December 31, 1994) have been indefinitely reinvested;  
therefore, no provision has been made for taxes due upon remittance of these  
earnings.  Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability 
on these unremitted earnings is not practicable. 
 
	The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
at December 31 were as follows:

and deferred income tax liabilities of $38 million and $40 million. 
 
    The company has aggregate non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately 
$314 million.  Of this amount, $270 million expires through the year 2004 and 
$44 million has no expiration. 
 
    Income taxes paid were $399 million, $231 million and $108 million for 
1994, 1993 and 1992. 
 
Rental Expense and Lease Commitments 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Rental and lease expense was $145 million in 1994, $132 million in 1993 and 
$143 million in 1992.  The company conducts certain operations in leased  
facilities and also leases a portion of its data processing and other  
equipment.  The lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal  
provisions and require the company to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance 
costs. 
 
 
    At December 31, 1994, the company was committed under non-cancelable 
leases with minimum rentals in succeeding years as follows:

Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The Board of Directors 
Texas Instruments Incorporated 
 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Texas  
Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 1994 
and 1993, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'  
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  
December 31, 1994.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these  
financial statements based on our audits. 
 
    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing  
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant  
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial  
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion. 
 
    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above  
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Texas  
Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and 
the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in  
the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally accepted  
accounting principles. 
 
    As discussed in the "Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans" and "Income  
Taxes" notes to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company changed its  
method of accounting for retiree health care benefits and income taxes.

1994 Results of Operations Compared with 1993 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
TI's orders for 1994 were $10.4 billion, up 21 percent from $8.6 billion  
in 1993.  Significantly higher semiconductor orders in the components segment  
were the primary contributor to the change.  Defense electronics orders  
increased due primarily to the timing of orders. 
 
	TI's net revenues for 1994 were $10.3 billion, up 21 percent from $8.5  
billion in 1993.  The increase was due primarily to higher semiconductor  
revenues in the components segment, resulting from increased shipments and new 
products.  Profit from operations was $1083 million in 1994, up 49 percent  
from $728 million in 1993.  Higher semiconductor operating profits accounted 
for much of the increase; higher royalties also contributed.  Results for 1994 
include a profit-sharing accrual of $175 million compared with $83 million  
accrued in 1993. 
 
	Results for the year include one-time royalty revenues of $73 million,  
compared with $90 million in 1993.  Results also include $132 million in  
pretax restructuring and divestiture charges taken in the first quarter of  
1994, compared with $23 million in pretax consolidation charges taken in the  
fourth quarter of 1993. 
 
	The income tax provision for 1994 is for U.S. and non-U.S. taxes.  Non- 
U.S. taxes include a benefit from tax loss carryforward utilization reduced by 
certain non-U.S. taxes and losses for which no benefit was recognized.  TI's  
income tax rate for the year was 33.7 percent.  For 1993, the provision was  
net of an increase in deferred tax assets for the effect of the increase in  
the U.S. statutory rate. 
 
	TI's orders for the fourth quarter of 1994 were $2534 million, compared 
with $2247 million for the same period in 1993.  Higher semiconductor and  
electrical controls orders in the components segment offset a decline in  
defense electronics orders.  TI's semiconductor orders were up over year-ago  
levels, led by substantial growth in memory and digital signal processing  
products. 
 
	Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 1994 were $2782 million, compared  
with $2374 million in the fourth quarter of 1993.  The increase was due  
primarily to higher semiconductor revenues in the components segment,  
attributable to increased shipments and new products.  The decline in defense 
revenues was due to ramping down of mature production programs.  The increase 
in digital segment revenue in the fourth quarter of 1994 was primarily in 
custom manufacturing services and software.   
 
	Profit from operations for the fourth quarter increased 47 percent to 
$291 million, from $198 million in the same period of 1993.  The largest 
increase was in semiconductor operations.  Improvement in personal  
productivity products, resulting from consolidation actions taken in the 
fourth quarter of 1993, and higher royalties also contributed to the increase. 
 
	Fourth-quarter 1994 results include an accrual of $48 million for profit 
sharing, as well as one-time charges for previously announced employment- 
reduction actions in international operations, including Japan, and start-up 
costs for new semiconductor capacity in Dallas.  Fourth-quarter 1993 results 
included an accrual of $31 million for profit sharing and a pretax charge of 
$23 million related to the consolidation of TI's consumer and peripheral  
products businesses.  Net income in the fourth quarter of 1994 was $188  
million, and earnings per share were $1.98, compared with net income of $134 
million and earnings per share of $1.42 in the fourth quarter of 1993. 
 
	Manufacturing operations have resumed at KTI Semiconductor in Nishiwaki, 
Japan, after being suspended following the earthquake in Kobe.  KTI is a  
joint-venture manufacturing facility of TI and Kobe Steel. 
 
	TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1994, was $3913  
million, up $108 million from the end of 1993, due to increases in  
semiconductor backlog.  Backlog was down $249 million from the end of the  
third quarter of 1994, primarily because of a decline in defense electronics 
backlog. 
 
Texas Instruments Incorporated and Subsidiaries 
                                         42 
 
	TI-funded R&D was $689 million for 1994 and $190 million for the fourth  
quarter, compared with $590 million and $170 million for the same periods of 
1993.  Customer-funded R&D was $356 million in 1994, compared with $391  
million in 1993. 
 
	Capital expenditures were $1076 million in 1994 and $320 million in the 
fourth quarter, compared with $730 million and $218 million in the same  
periods of 1993.  
 
	Depreciation for 1994 was $665 million, compared with $617 million in  
1993, and $179 million in the fourth quarter of 1994, compared with $167  
million in the same period of 1993.  Depreciation in 1995 is expected to be  
about $800 million. 
 
Components Segment:  Orders in the components segment were up 27 percent for  
the year, and revenues up 33 percent, from 1993.  Components segment profit  
increased substantially, primarily because of improved semiconductor  
manufacturing productivity and higher royalties. 
 
	For the fourth quarter of 1994, orders in the components segment were up  
28 percent over the same period of 1993, with strong increases in  
semiconductor orders.  Segment revenues were up 31 percent from the same  
period of a year ago, reflecting higher semiconductor revenues.  Segment  
profit increased substantially over the fourth quarter of 1993 because of  
improved semiconductor operating performance and higher royalties. 
 
Defense Electronics Segment:  In TI's defense electronics segment, 1994 orders 
were up 11 percent from 1993 due to timing of orders.  Revenues were down 7  
percent from 1993, primarily because of reduced shipments of mature production 
programs.  Margins for the year were essentially flat with 1993. 
 
	Fourth-quarter 1994 orders in defense electronics were down 30 percent  
from the fourth quarter of 1993 because of reduced procurement levels on  
mature production programs.  Revenues were down 17 percent from the high level 
of the fourth quarter of 1993, which included shipments that were delayed from 
the third quarter of 1993.  Margins remained essentially flat with fourth  
quarter of 1993. 
 
Digital Products Segment:  Orders in TI's digital products segment were up 10 
percent in 1994, and revenues up 14 percent, compared with 1993.  The segment 
operated at a profit for the year, with royalty revenues and profits from the 
personal productivity products business more than offsetting the divestiture 
charges taken in the first quarter of 1994. 
 
	For the fourth quarter of 1994, orders in the digital segment were  
essentially flat with the same period of 1993.  Revenues were up 12 percent  
and the segment operated at a profit. 
 
Intellectual Property:  During 1994, TI reached new semiconductor patent- 
license agreements with Micron Technology Inc. and GoldStar Electron Co., Ltd. 
 
	As previously reported, on August 31, 1994, the district court in Tokyo  
ruled that Fujitsu's production of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K  
EPROMs does not infringe the company's Kilby patent.  The company has appealed 
the court's decision to the Tokyo High Court.  The decision should not have 
any significant effect on existing patent-license agreements.   
 
	Most of the existing semiconductor patent-license agreements expire at 
the end of 1995 or early in 1996, and preparations have begun for the upcoming 
round of negotiations regarding their renewal.  The agreements with GoldStar, 
Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd., Micron, Mitsubishi Electric  
Corporation, Toshiba Corporation and Yamaha Corporation have expiration dates 
ranging from 1998 to 2001.  Also, the company will continue negotiations with 
computer manufacturers in an effort to reach additional computer system  
patent-license agreements.  
 
	As in prior years, TI's negotiations are dependent on the strength of  
the company's entire patent portfolio and not on a single patent.  Although  
these negotiations by their nature are not predictable as to outcome or  
timing, TI continues to expect a significant ongoing stream of royalty revenue 
throughout the remainder of the decade.

Financial Condition 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
TI's financial condition remained strong in 1994 as cash flow from operating  
activities net of additions to property, plant and equipment was a positive  
$456 million. 
 
	During the year, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments  
increased by $402 million to $1290 million, primarily because of the cash flow 
mentioned above.  On September 29, 1994, $76 million 
 
Texas Instruments Incorporated and Subsidiaries 
                                                 43 
 
Supplemental Financial Information 
(continued) 
 
of TI's 2.75% convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 were redeemed at  
the option of the holders.  The $124 million remaining balance was classified 
as a long-term liability at the end of the third quarter because the holders' 
redemption period had lapsed.  In early April, the company amended its asset 
securitization agreement for accounts receivable and reduced the outstanding 
balance from $175 million to $125 million.  In January 1995, the company  
reduced the outstanding balance to zero, and the agreement will be terminated 
effective January 30, 1995.  On June 17, 1994, the company announced an  
increase in the annual common dividend rate per share from $.72 to $1.00,  
resulting in approximately $7 million of increased dividend payments per  
quarter (at current common share balances).  TI's debt-to-total-capital ratio 
was .21 at the end of 1994, down from .23 at the end of the third quarter and 
.28 at year-end 1993. 
 
	Unexpended authorizations for future capital expenditures were  
approximately $816 million at December 31, 1994.  In view of increased  
semiconductor demand, we plan to raise capital expenditures in 1995 to about 
$1.3 billion, from $1076 million in 1994.  The funds will be supplied by cash 
from operations and existing cash balances. 
 
	At December 31, 1994, the company had deferred income tax assets of $580 
million, after a valuation allowance of $330 million, and deferred income tax  
liabilities of $38 million.  The valuation allowance reflects the company's  
assessment regarding the realizability of certain non-U.S. deferred income tax 
assets.  The balance of the deferred income tax assets is considered  
realizable based on carryback potential, existing taxable temporary  
differences, and expectation of future income levels comparable to recent  
results.  Such future income levels are not assured because of the nature of 
the company's businesses, which are generally characterized by rapidly  
changing technology and intense competition.  The company evaluates  
realizability of the deferred income tax assets quarterly. 
 
	The company maintains unused lines of credit to support commercial paper  
borrowing and to provide additional liquidity.  Unused lines of credit were  
approximately $547 million at December 31, 1994.  Of this amount, $440 million 
was available to support commercial paper borrowing. 
 
	The company believes that its financial condition provides the  
foundation for continued support of the programs essential to TI's future.

1993 Results of Operations Compared with 1992 
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
TI's orders for 1993 were $8595 million, up 12 percent from $7645 million in  
1992.  Significantly higher semiconductor orders in the components segment  
were the primary contributor to the change. 
 
    TI's net revenues for 1993 were $8523 million, compared with $7440 million 
in 1992.  Essentially all of the increase was in semiconductor revenues in the 
components segment, resulting primarily from new products and increased  
shipments.  Royalty revenues for the year were $521 million, up 33 percent 
from 1992.  The increase was primarily the result of new agreements with  
personal computer manufacturers covering TI's computer systems patents and  
higher shipments by licensees under TI's semiconductor patents.  Profit from  
operations was $728 million in 1993, up 73 percent from $420 million in 1992. 
Higher semiconductor operating profits and higher royalties accounted for  
virtually all of the increase.  Results for 1993 included a profit-sharing  
accrual of $83 million.  There was no accrual for profit sharing in 1992. 
 
    Net income for the year was $472 million, compared with $247 million in  
1992. 
 
    The income tax provision for 1993 was for U.S. and non-U.S. taxes, net of 
a third-quarter increase in deferred tax assets for the effect of the increase 
in the U.S. statutory rate.  TI's income tax rate for the year was 31.6  
percent. 
 
    TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1993, was $3805  
million, up $72 million from the end of 1992, as increases in semiconductor  
backlog more than offset a decline in defense electronics. 
 
    TI-funded R&D was $590 million for 1993, compared with $470 million for  
1992.  Customer-funded R&D was $391 million in 1993, compared with $421  
million in 1992. 
 
    Capital expenditures were $730 million in 1993, compared with $429 million 
in 1992. 
 
    Depreciation for 1993 was $617 million, compared with $610 million in  
1992. 
 
Components Segment:  Orders in the components segment were up 32 percent for  
the year, and revenues up 28 percent, from 1992.  Components segment profit  
doubled from 1992, with semiconductor operating improvement accounting for  
virtually all of the increase. 
 
Defense Electronics Segment:  In TI's defense electronics segment, 1993 orders 
were down 26 percent from 1992 because Operation Desert Storm replenishment  
orders

were not repeated in 1993.  Revenues were down 7 percent from 1992, primarily 
because of reduced shipments of the High-Speed Antiradiation Missile.  Margins 
for the year were essentially flat with 1992. 
 
Digital Products Segment:  Orders in TI's digital products segment were up 11 
percent in 1993, and revenues up 8 percent, compared with 1992.  Excluding the 
effect of the 1992 sale of TI's multiuser minicomputer systems and service 
operations to Hewlett-Packard, 1993 orders were up 25 percent, and revenues up 
24 percent, over 1992.  The segment operated at a profit for the year 1993, as 
royalty revenues more than offset operating losses. 
 
Metallurgical Materials Segment:  In the metallurgical materials segment,  
orders were up 12 percent, and revenues were up 5 percent, from 1992.  The  
segment operated at a small loss for the year, primarily because of increased 
investments in new technologies, including solar energy. 
 
Intellectual Property:  During 1993, TI reached new semiconductor patent- 
license agreements with Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd. and Nippon  
Steel Semiconductor Corporation.  We also reached computer systems patent- 
license agreements with personal computer manufacturers including Compaq  
Computer Corporation, Daewoo Electronics Company, Ltd., Daewoo Telecom Co.,  
Ltd., Dell Computer Corporation, Gateway 2000, Inc., Hyundai, Packard Bell  
Electronics, Inc., Toshiba Corporation, and Zenith Data Systems.

    Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, which  
required accrual of expected retiree health care benefit costs during the  
employees' working careers, and SFAS No. 109, which required increased  
recording of deferred income tax assets.  This resulted in a 1993 first  
quarter charge of $294 million ($3.12 per share) for SFAS No. 106 and a credit 
of $290 million ($3.08 per share) for SFAS No. 109, for the cumulative effect 
of the accounting changes. 
 
    Earnings per common and common equivalent share are based on average  
common and common equivalent shares outstanding (95,131,937 shares and  
94,154,923 shares for the fourth quarters of 1994 and 1993).  In computing  
per-share earnings, net income is increased by $1 million for the fourth  
quarter of 1993 for interest (net of tax and profit sharing effect) on the  
convertible debentures considered dilutive common stock equivalents.
