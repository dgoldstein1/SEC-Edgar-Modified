                                  PART I

ITEM 1.   Business. 

General
- -------
          Texas Instruments Incorporated (hereinafter the "Registrant,"
including subsidiaries except where the context indicates otherwise) is
engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a variety of products in
the electrical and electronics industry for industrial, government and
consumer markets.  These products consist of components, defense electronics
and digital products.  The Registrant also produces metallurgical materials.
In addition, the Registrant s patent portfolio has been established as an
ongoing contributor to the Registrant s revenues.  The Registrant's business
is based principally on its broad semiconductor technology and application of
this technology to selected electronic end-equipment markets. The Registrant
from time to time considers acquisitions and divestitures which may alter its
business mix.  The Registrant may effect one or more such transactions at such
time or times as the Registrant determines to be appropriate.  

          The information with respect to net revenues, profit and
identifiable assets of the Registrant's industry segments and operations
outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the financial
statements captioned "Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations" on
pages 30-31 of the Registrant's 1993 annual report to stockholders, is
incorporated herein by reference to such annual report. 

Components
- ----------
          Components consist of semiconductor integrated circuits (such as
microprocessors/microcontrollers, applications processors, memories, and
digital and linear circuits), semiconductor discrete devices, semiconductor
subassemblies (such as custom modules for specific applications), and
electrical and electronic control devices (such as motor protectors, starting
relays, circuit breakers, thermostats, sensors, and radio-frequency
identification systems).

          These components are used in a broad range of products for
industrial end-use (such as computers, data terminals and peripheral
equipment, telecommunications, instrumentation, and industrial motor controls
and automation equipment), consumer end-use (such as televisions, cameras,
automobiles, home appliances, and residential air conditioning and heating
systems) and government end-use (such as defense and space equipment). The
Registrant sells these components primarily to original equipment
manufacturers principally through its own marketing organizations and to a
lesser extent through distributors. 

Defense Electronics
- -------------------
          Defense electronics consist of radar systems, navigation systems,
infrared surveillance and fire control systems, defense suppression missiles,
other weapon systems (including antitank and interdiction weapons), missile
guidance and control systems, electronic warfare systems, and other defense
electronic equipment.  Sales are made primarily to the U.S. government either
directly or through prime contractors.

                                     2<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Digital Products
- ----------------
          Digital products include software productivity tools, integrated
enterprise information solutions, notebook computers, printers, electronic
calculators and learning aids, and custom engineering and manufacturing
services.

          Digital products are used in a broad range of enterprise-wide,
work group and personal information-based applications.  The Registrant
markets these products through various channels, including system suppliers,
business equipment dealers, distributors, retailers, and direct sales to end-
users and original equipment manufacturers.

Metallurgical Materials
- -----------------------
          Metallurgical materials include clad metals, precision-engineered
parts and electronic connectors for use in a variety of applications such as
appliances, automobiles, electronic components, and industrial and
telecommunications equipment.  These metallurgical materials are primarily
sold directly to original equipment manufacturers.  This segment also includes
development costs associated with solar cells.

Competition
- -----------
          The Registrant is engaged in highly competitive businesses.  Its
competitors include several of the largest companies in the United States,
East Asia, particularly Japan, and elsewhere abroad as well as many small,
specialized companies.  The Registrant is a significant competitor in each of
its principal businesses.  Generally, the Registrant's businesses are
characterized by rapidly changing technology which has, throughout the
Registrant's history, intensified the competitive factors, primarily
performance and price. 

Government Sales
- ----------------
          Net revenues directly from federal government agencies in the
United States, principally related to the defense electronics segment,
accounted for approximately 12% of the Registrant's net revenues in 1993.  

          Contracts for government sales generally contain provisions for
cancellation at the convenience of the government.  In addition, companies
engaged in supplying military equipment to the government are dependent on
congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, and may be
affected by changes in government policies resulting from various military and
political developments.  See "ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings."

Backlog
- -------
          The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by the Registrant
to be firm was $3805 million as of December 31, 1993 and $3733 million as of
December 31, 1992.  Approximately 25% of the 1993 backlog (involving defense
electronics) is not expected to be filled within the current fiscal year.  The
backlog is significant in the business of the Registrant only as an indication
of future revenues which may be entered on the books of account of the
Registrant. 

                                     3<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Raw Materials
- -------------
          The Registrant purchases materials, parts and supplies from a
number of suppliers.  In addition, the Registrant produces some materials,
parts and supplies, such as silicon wafers used in the manufacture of
semiconductors, for its own use.  The materials,  parts and supplies essential
to the Registrant's business are generally available at present and the
Registrant believes at this time that such materials, parts and supplies will
be available in the foreseeable future.

Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
          The Registrant owns many patents in the United States and other
countries in fields relating to its businesses.  The Registrant has developed
a strong, broad-based patent portfolio.  The Registrant also has several
agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that
other licenses may be negotiated in the future.  The Registrant does not
consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent
license, although taken as a whole, the rights of the Registrant and the
products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to the
Registrant's business. As noted above, the Registrant's patent portfolio has
been established as an ongoing contributor to the revenues of the Registrant.
The Registrant continues to earn a significant ongoing stream of royalty
revenue. See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" and "ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings."

          The Registrant owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its
business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which
are "Texas Instruments" and the Registrant's corporate monogram. 

Research and Development
- ------------------------
          Expenditures for research and development were $981 million in
1993 compared with $891 million in 1992 and $915 million in 1991.  Of these
amounts, $590 million was company funded in 1993, ($470 million in 1992 and
$527 million in 1991), and $391 million in 1993 ($421 million in 1992 and $388
million in 1991) was funded by others, principally the U. S. government. 

Seasonality
- -----------
          The Registrant's revenues are subject to some seasonal variation. 

Employees
- ---------
          The information concerning the number of persons employed by the
Registrant at December 31, 1993 on page 34 of the Registrant's 1993 annual
report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual
report.

</TABLE>
          The Registrant's facilities in the United States contained
approximately 19,424,675 square feet as of December 31, 1993, of which
approximately 4,848,720 square feet were leased.  The Registrant's facilities
outside the United States contained approximately 6,644,166 square feet as of
December 31, 1993, of which approximately 1,845,190 square feet were leased. 

          The Registrant believes that its existing properties are in good
condition and suitable for the manufacture of its products. The Registrant's
facilities in Denton, northwest Houston and Abilene, Texas are being marketed
for sale.  Otherwise, at the end of 1993, the Registrant utilized
substantially all of the space in its facilities. 

          Leases covering the Registrant's leased facilities expire at
varying dates generally within the next 15 years.  The Registrant anticipates
no difficulty in either retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-
month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or replacing the leased
facilities with equivalent facilities.

                                     5

ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings.

          On July 19, 1991, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District
Court against Fujitsu Limited ( Fujitsu ) seeking injunctive relief, alleging
that Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of certain DRAMs infringe the Registrant's
Japanese patent on the invention of the integrated circuit (the  Kilby 
patent).  Concurrently, Fujitsu brought a lawsuit in the same court against
the Registrant, seeking a declaration that Fujitsu is not infringing the Kilby
patent.  See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."
          
          The Registrant is included among a number of U.S. defense
contractors which are currently the subject of U.S. government investigations
regarding alleged procurement irregularities.  The Registrant is unable to
predict the outcome of the investigations at this time or to estimate the
kinds or amounts of claims or other actions that could be instituted against
the Registrant.  Under present government procurement regulations, such
investigations could lead to a government contractor's being suspended or
debarred from eligibility for awards of new government contracts for an
initial period of up to three years.  In the current environment, even matters
that seem limited to disputes about contract interpretation can result in
criminal prosecution.  While criminal charges against contractors have
resulted from such investigations, the Registrant does not believe such
charges would be appropriate in its case and has not, at any time, lost its
eligibility to enter into government contracts or subcontracts under these
regulations.

          The Registrant is involved in various investigations and
proceedings conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and
certain state environmental agencies regarding disposal of waste materials. 
Although the factual situations and the progress of each of these matters
differ, the Registrant believes that in each case its liability will be
limited to sharing clean-up or other remedial costs with other potentially
responsible parties, in amounts that will not have a material adverse effect
upon its financial position or results of operations.

compared to $77 billion in 1993.  The market grew 29 percent in 1993.

          On March 9, 1994, the Registrant announced that it had reached
semiconductor patent-license agreements with Micron Technology Inc. and
Goldstar Electron Co., Ltd.  Payments to the Registrant under the agreements
include catch-up payments, which will be reflected in the Registrant's first-
quarter 1994 results, and ongoing royalties throughout the terms of the
licenses (which run through 1998).  By reaching agreement with Micron,
Goldstar and 24 other semiconductor companies throughout the world, the
Registrant has substantially completed the "1990 round" of its semiconductor
industry licensing program and can begin to focus on the 1995 round of renewal
discussions which will begin next year.

     The agreement with Micron ends litigation between the Registrant and
Micron, reducing the Registrant's semiconductor patent litigation to two
conflicts, that with Fujitsu Limited over the Kilby Patent in Japan and with
four semiconductor manufacturers in the United States over the Registrant's
plastic encapsulation patents.

     The litigation in Japan is proceeding to a conclusion, although the
timing of action on the plastic encapsulation lawsuit remains uncertain.  The
record in the Fujitsu litigation has been closed and no new arguments will be
heard by the court.  A decision is expected before mid-1994.  The Registrant
believes the Kilby patent should be enforced by the court.  It has to be
recognized, however, that litigation is uncertain by its nature as to timing
and outcome, and that this litigation is in a country which has yet to
establish a clear record for protecting intellectual property.

 Substantially all depreciation is computed by either the declining balance
method (primarily 150-percent declining method) or the sum-of-the-years-digits 
method. Depreciable lives used to calculate depreciation for buildings and
improvements are 5-40 years, and for machinery and equipment 3-10 years.

                                    of

                      TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED

                      Pursuant to Section 151 of the
                      General Corporation Law of the
                             State of Delaware


          We, William E. Boisvert, a Vice President, and Clara C. O'Donnell,
Assistant Secretary, of Texas Instruments Incorporated, organized and existing
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in accordance with
the provisions of Section 103 thereof, DO HEREBY CERTIFY:

          That pursuant to the authority conferred upon the Board of
Directors by the Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the
"Certificate of Incorporation"), of the said Company, the said Board of
Directors on June 17, 1988 adopted the following resolution creating a series
of 1,500,000 shares of Preferred Stock designated as Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock:

         RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of
Directors of this Company in accordance with the provisions of its Certificate
of Incorporation, a series of Preferred Stock of the Company be and it hereby
is created, and that the designation and amount thereof and the voting powers,
preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights of
the shares of such series, and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions
thereof are as follows:

         Section 1.  Designation and Amount.  The shares of such series shall
be designated as "Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock" and the number of
shares constituting such series shall be 1,500,000.

         Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

         (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of the holders of any
shares of any series of Preferred Stock ranking prior and superior to the
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the
holders of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, in preference
to the shares of Common Stock, par value $1 per share, of the Company (the
"Common Stock"), and any other stock of the Company junior to the 
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of
funds legally available for the purpose, quarterly dividends payable in cash
on the fourth Monday of January, April, July and October in each year (each
such date being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment Date"), 
commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first
issuance of a share or fraction of a share of Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock, in an amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to
the greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for adjustment
hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per share amount of all cash
dividends, and 100 times the aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of
all non-cash dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable in
shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (by reclassification or otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since
the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with respect to
the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of any
share or fraction of a share of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock.  In
the event the Company shall at any time after June 17, 1988 (the "Rights
Declaration Date") (i) declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in
shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii)
combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in 
each such case the amount to which holders of shares of Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under
clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such
amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common 
Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is
the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior
to such event.

         (B)  The Company shall declare a dividend or distribution on the
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above
immediately after it declares a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock
(other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that, in
the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on the Common
Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and 
the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per
share on the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be
payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date. 

         (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative on outstanding
shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend
Payment Date next preceding the date of issue of such shares of Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such shares is prior
to the record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which
case dividends on such shares shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of
such shares, or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment Date
or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of shares
of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly 
dividend and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which
events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such
Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear
interest.  Dividends paid on the shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the time
accrued and payable  on such shares shall be allocated pro rata on a 
share-by-share basis among all such shares at the time outstanding.  The Board
of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of shares
of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a
dividend or distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more 
than 60 days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

         Section 3.  Voting Rights.  In addition to any other voting rights
required by law, the holders of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock shall have only the following voting rights:

         (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth,
each share of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall entitle the
holder thereof to 100 votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the
stockholders of the Company.  In the event the Company shall at any time after
the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock payable
in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, or
(iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of 
shares, then in each such case the number of votes per share to which holders
of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock were entitled
immediately prior to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number
by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the 
number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to
such event.

         (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of
shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock and the holders of shares
of Common Stock shall vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a
vote of stockholders of the Company.

         (C)  Whenever, at any time, dividends payable on the Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be in arrears for such number of dividend
periods as shall in the aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders
of such series shall have the exclusive right, voting separately as a class
with holders of shares of any one or more other series of preferred stock
ranking on a parity with such series either as to dividends or on the
distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon
which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to 
elect two directors of the Company at the Company's next annual meeting of
stockholders and at each subsequent annual meeting of stockholders until such
right is terminated as provided in this resolution.  At elections for such
directors, each holder of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to one vote for each one-hundredth of a share held (the holders of
shares of any other series of preferred stock ranking on such a parity being
entitled to such number of votes, if any, for each share of stock held as may
be applicable to them).  Upon the vesting of such voting right in the holders
of the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, the maximum authorized number
of members of the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two
and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote of the holders of
such series (with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of
preferred stock ranking on such a parity) as hereinafter set forth.  The right
of the holders of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, voting separately
as a class with the holders of shares of any one or more other series of
preferred stock ranking on such a parity, to elect members of the Board of
Directors of the Company as aforesaid shall continue until such time as all
dividends accumulated on such series shall have been paid in full, at which
time such right shall terminate, except as by law expressly provided, subject
to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent default of the 
character above mentioned.

         Upon any termination of the right of the holders of the Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock as a class to vote for directors as herein
provided, the term of office of all directors then in office elected by the
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock voting as a class shall terminate
immediately.  If the office of any director elected by the holders of the
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock voting as a class becomes vacant by
reason of death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal from
office, or otherwise, the remaining director elected by the holders of the
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock voting as a class may choose a
successor who shall hold office for the unexpired term in respect of which
such vacancy occurred.  Whenever the special voting powers vested in the
holders of the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock as provided in this
resolution shall have expired, the number of directors shall become such
number as may be provided for in the By-Laws, or resolution of the Board of
Directors thereunder, irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the
provisions of this resolution.

         (D)  Except as set forth herein, holders of Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consent shall
not be required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders
of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

         Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

         (A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other dividends or distributions
payable on the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock as provided in Section
2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid dividends and
distributions, whether or not declared, on shares of Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been paid in full, the Company shall 
not:

         (i)  declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, or
redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock
ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) to the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock; 

         (ii)  declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on
any shares of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
liquidation dissolution or winding up) with the Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock, except dividends paid ratably on the Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on which dividends are payable or in
arrears in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of all such
shares are then entitled;

        (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration
shares of any stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon
liquidation, dissolution or winding up) with the Participating Cumulative 
Preferred Stock, provided that the Company may at any time redeem, purchase or
otherwise acquire shares of any such parity stock in exchange for shares of
any stock of the Company ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon
dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock; or

        (iv)  purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on a
parity with the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, except in accordance
with a purchase offer made in writing or by publication (as determined by the
Board of Directors) to all holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board
of Directors, after consideration of the respective annual dividend rates and
other relative rights and preferences of the respective series and classes,
shall determine in good faith will result in fair and equitable treatment
among the respective series or classes.

         (B)  The Company shall not permit any subsidiary of the Company to
purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of stock of the
Company unless the Company could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4,
purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in such manner.

         Section 5.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company in
any manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the
acquisition thereof.  All such shares shall upon their cancellation become
authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part
of a new series of Preferred Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions
of the Board of Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on
issuance set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation.

         Section 6.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.  Upon any
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, no distribution shall
be made (1) to the holders of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to
dividends or upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Participating
Cumulative Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto, the holders of shares of 
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have received $100.00 per
share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions
thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such payment, provided that
the holders of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive an aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision 
for adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the aggregate amount
to be distributed per share to holders of Common Stock, or (2) to the holders
of stock ranking on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
dissolution or winding up) with the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock,
except distributions made ratably on the Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock and all other such parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to
which the holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up.  In the event the Company shall at any time after
the Rights Declaration Date declare or pay any dividend on Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or 
consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by reclassification
or otherwise than by payment of a dividend in shares of Common Stock) into a
greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the
aggregate amount to which holders of shares of Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event under the 
proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence shall be adjusted by
multiplying such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to such event. 

         Section 7.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case the Company shall
enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in
which the shares of Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock
or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case the
shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall at the same time be 
similarly exchanged or changed in an amount per share (subject to the
provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the
aggregate amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property (payable
in kind), as the case may be, into which or for which each share of Common
Stock is changed or exchanged.  In the event the Company shall at any time
after the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common 
Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence
with respect to the exchange or change of shares of Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event and the denominator of which is the number of
shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such event. 

         Section 8.  No Redemption.  The shares of Participating Cumulative
Preferred Stock shall not be redeemable.

         Section 9.  Rank.  The Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall
rank junior with respect to payment of dividends and on liquidation to all
other series of the Company's preferred stock outstanding on the date hereof
and to all such other series that may be issued after the date hereof except
to the extent that any such other series specifically provides that it shall
rank junior to the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock.

         Section 10.  Amendment.  The Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company and these resolutions shall not be amended in any manner which would
materially alter or change the powers, preferences or special rights of the
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely
without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the 
outstanding shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a class.

         Section 11.  Fractional Shares.  Participating Cumulative Preferred
Stock may be issued in fractions of a share which shall entitle the holder, in
proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to exercise voting rights,
receive dividends, participate in distributions and to have the benefit of all
other rights of holders of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we have executed and subscribed this Certificate
and do affirm the foregoing as true under the penalties of perjury this 21st
day of June, 1988.

                      Person's Affiliates or Associates, directly

            commencement of a tender or exchange offer by any Person
            (other than the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any
            employee benefit plan of the Company or of any Subsidiary of
            the Company, or any Person or entity organized, appointed or
            established for or pursuant to the terms of any such plan)
            if, upon consummation thereof, such Person would be an
            Acquiring Person (including any such date which is after the
            date of this Agreement and prior to the issuance of the
            Rights; the earlier of such dates being herein referred to as
            the "Distribution Date"), (x) the Rights will be evidenced
            by the certificates for the Common Stock registered in the
            names of the holders of the Common Stock (which certificates
            for Common Stock shall be deemed also to be Right Certifi-
            cates) and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the
            Rights will be transferable only in connection with the
            transfer of the underlying shares of Common Stock.  As soon
            as practicable after the Company has notified the Rights
            Agent of the occurrence of the Distribution Date, the Rights
            Agent will send, by first-class, insured, postage prepaid
            mail, to each record holder of the Common Stock as of the
            close of business on the Distribution Date, at the address of
            such holder shown on the records of the Company, one or more
            right certificates, in substantially the form of Exhibit B
            hereto (the "Right Certificates"), evidencing one Right for
            each share of Common Stock so held, subject to adjustment as

                                         -5-


            provided herein.  In the event that an adjustment in the
            number of Rights per share of Common Stock has been made
            pursuant to Section 11(p) hereof, at the time of distribution
            of the Right Certificates, the Company shall make the neces-
            sary and appropriate rounding adjustments (in accordance with
            Section 14(a) hereof) so that the Right Certificates repre-
            senting only whole numbers of Rights are distributed and cash
            is paid in lieu of any fractional Rights.  As of and after
            the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by
            such Right Certificates.

                      (b)  As soon as practicable after the Record Date,
            the Company will send a copy of a Summary of Rights to Pur-
            chase Preferred Stock, in substantially the form of Exhibit C
            hereto (the "Summary of Rights"), by first-class, postage
            prepaid mail, to each record holder of the Common Stock as of
            the close of business on the Record Date at the address of
            such holder shown on the records of the Company.  With
            respect to certificates for the Common Stock outstanding as
            of the Record Date until the Distribution Date (or the ear-
            lier redemption, expiration or termination of the Rights),
            the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates for the
            Common Stock registered in the names of the holders of the
            Common Stock and the registered holders of the Common Stock
            shall also be registered holders of the associated Rights.
            Until the Distribution Date (or the earlier redemption,
            expiration or termination of the Rights), the transfer of any
            of the certificates for the Common Stock in respect of which
            Rights have been issued shall also constitute the transfer of
            the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by
            such certificates.

                      (c)  Rights shall be issued in respect of all
            shares of Common Stock which are issued or delivered out of
            treasury after the Record Date but on or prior to the Dis-
            tribution Date (or the earlier redemption, expiration or
            termination of the Rights).  Certificates for the Common
            Stock issued or delivered out of treasury after the Record
            Date but on or prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date
            or the redemption, expiration or termination of the Rights
            shall be deemed also to be certificates for Rights and shall
            have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise
            affixed to them the following legend:

                      This certificate also evidences and entitles
                      the holder hereof to certain Rights as set
                      forth in a Rights Agreement between Texas
                      Instruments Incorporated and Morgan
                      Shareholder Services Trust Company dated as of

                                         -6-

                      June 17, 1988 (the "Rights Agreement"), the
                      terms of which are hereby incorporated herein
                      by reference and a copy of which is on file at
                      the principal executive offices of the Com-
                      pany.  Under certain circumstances, as set
                      forth in the Rights Agreement, such Rights may
                      be redeemed, may expire, or may be evidenced
                      by separate certificates and no longer be
                      evidenced by this certificate.  The Company
                      will mail to the holder of this certificate a
                      copy of the Rights Agreement without charge
                      promptly after receipt of a written request
                      therefor.  Under certain circumstances set
                      forth in the Rights Agreement, Rights issued
                      to, or held by, any Person who is, was or
                      becomes an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or
                      Associate thereof (as such terms are defined
                      in the Rights Agreement), whether currently
                      held by or on behalf of such Person or by any
                      subsequent holder, may be null and void.

            With respect to such certificates containing the foregoing
            legend, until the Distribution Date (or the earlier redemp-
            tion, expiration or termination of the Rights) the Rights
            associated with the Common Stock represented by such certifi-
            cates shall be evidenced by such certificates alone, and the
            transfer of any of such certificates shall also constitute
            the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock
            represented by such certificates.

                      Section 4.  Form of Right Certificates.  (a)  The
            Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase and
            of assignment and the certificates to be printed on the
            reverse thereof) shall be substantially in the form of
            Exhibit B hereto and may have such marks of identification or
            designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements
            printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as
            are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement,
            or as may be required to comply with any applicable law, rule
            or regulation or with any rule or regulation of any stock
            exchange on which the Rights may from time to time be listed,
            or to conform to usage.  Subject to the provisions of Section
            11 and Section 22 hereof, the Right Certificates, whenever
            distributed, shall be dated as of the Record Date and on
            their face shall entitle the holders thereof to purchase such
            number of one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock
            as shall be set forth therein at the price set forth therein
            (such exercise price per one one-hundredth of a share, the
            "Purchase Price"), but the amount and type of securities

                                         -7-

            purchasable upon the exercise of each Right and the Purchase
            Price thereof shall be subject to adjustment as provided
            herein.

                      (b)  Any Right Certificate issued pursuant to
            Section 3(a) or Section 22 hereof that represents Rights
            beneficially owned by:  (i) an Acquiring Person or any
            Associate or Affiliate of an Acquiring Person, (ii) a trans-
            feree of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or
            Affiliate) who becomes a transferee after the Acquiring
            Person becomes such, or (iii) a transferee of an Acquiring
            Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who becomes a
            transferee prior to or concurrently with the Acquiring Person
            becoming such and receives such Rights pursuant to either (A)
            a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from the
            Acquiring Person to holders of equity interests in such
            Acquiring Person or to any Person with whom the Acquiring
            Person has any continuing agreement, arrangement or under-
            standing regarding the transferred Rights or (B) a transfer
            which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined is
            part of a plan, arrangement or understanding which has as a
            primary purpose or effect avoidance of Section 7(e) hereof,
            and any Right Certificate issued pursuant to Section 6 or
            Section 11 hereof upon transfer, exchange, replacement or
            adjustment of any other Right Certificate referred to in this
            sentence, shall contain (to the extent feasible) the follow-
            ing legend:

                      The Rights represented by this Right Certifi-
                      cate are or were beneficially owned by a
                      Person who was or became an Acquiring Person
                      or an Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring
                      Person (as such terms are defined in the
                      Rights Agreement).  Accordingly, this Right
                      Certificate and the Rights represented hereby
                      may become null and void in the circumstances
                      specified in Section 7(e) of such Agreement.

                      Section 5.  Countersignature and Registration.
            (a)  The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf
            of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, its Presi-
            dent or any Vice President, either manually or by fac-
            simile signature, and shall have affixed thereto the
            Company's seal or a facsimile thereof which shall be
            attested by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of
            the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature.
            The Right Certificates shall be manually countersigned
            by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any
            purpose unless so countersigned.  In case any officer of

                                         -8-

            the Company whose manual or facsimile signature is
            affixed to the Right Certificates shall cease to be such
            officer of the Company before countersignature by the
            Rights Agent and issuance and delivery by the Company,
            such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be counter-
            signed by the Rights Agent, issued and delivered with
            the same force and effect as though the Person who
            signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such
            officer of the Company.  Any Right Certificate may be
            signed on behalf of the Company by any Person who, at
            the actual date of the execution of such Right Certifi-
            cate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign
            such Right Certificate, although at the date of the
            execution of this Rights Agreement any such Person was
            not such an officer.

                      (b)  Following the Distribution Date, the
            Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at its
            principal office or offices designated as the
            appropriate place for surrender of Right Certificates
            upon exercise or transfer, books for registration and
            transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder.
            Such books shall show the names and addresses of the
            respective holders of the Right Certificates, the number
            of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right
            Certificates, the certificate number of each of the
            Right Certificates and the date of each of the Right
            Certificates.

                      Section 6.  Transfer, Split Up, Combination
            and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated,
            Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates.  (a)
            Subject to the provisions of Section 4(b), Section 7(e)
            and Section 14 hereof, at any time after the close of
            business on the Distribution Date, and at or prior to
            the close of business on the Expiration Date (as such
            term is defined in Section 7(a) hereof), any Right
            Certificate or Right Certificates may be transferred,
            split up, combined or exchanged for another Right Cer-
            tificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered
            holder to purchase a like number of one one-hundredths
            of a share of Preferred Stock (or, following a Trigger-
            ing Event, Common Stock, other securities, cash or
            assets, as the case may be) as the Right Certificate or
            Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder
            (or former holder in the case of a transfer) to pur-
            chase.  Any registered holder desiring to transfer,
            split up, combine or exchange any Right Certificate or
            Certificates shall make such request in writing

                                         -9-

            delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender the
            Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be trans-
            ferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the principal
            office or offices of the Rights Agent designated for
            such purpose.  Neither the Rights Agent nor the Company
            shall be obligated to take any action whatsoever with
            respect to the transfer of any such surrendered Right
            Certificate until the registered holder shall have
            completed and signed the certificate contained in the
            form of assignment on the reverse side of such Right
            Certificate and shall have provided such additional
            evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or
            former Beneficial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates
            thereof as the Company shall reasonably request.  There-
            upon the Rights Agent shall, subject to Section 4(b),
            Section 7(e) and Section 14 hereof, countersign and
            deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certifi-
            cate or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so
            requested.  The Company may require payment of a sum
            sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that
            may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split
            up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.

                      (b)  Upon receipt by the Company and the
            Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them
            of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right
            Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction,
            of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to
            them, and, at the Company's request, reimbursement to
            the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable
            expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the
            Rights Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate
            if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new
            Right Certificate of like tenor to the Rights Agent for
            countersignature and delivery to the registered owner in
            lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed
            or mutilated.

                      Section 7.  Exercise of Rights; Purchase
            Price; Expiration Date of Rights.  (a) Subject to Sec-
            tion 7(e) hereof, the registered holder of any Right
            Certificate may exercise the Rights evidenced thereby
            (except as otherwise provided herein including, without
            limitation, the restrictions on exercisability set forth
            in Section 9(c), Section 11(a)(iii) and Section 23(a)
            hereof) in whole or in part at any time after the Dis-
            tribution Date upon surrender of the Right Certificate,
            with the form of election to purchase and the certifi-
            cate on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the

                                        -10-

            Rights Agent at the principal office or offices of the
            Rights Agent designated for such purpose, together with
            payment of the aggregate Purchase Price with respect to
            the total number of one one-hundredths of a share of
            Preferred Stock (or other securities or property, as the
            case may be) as to which such surrendered Rights are
            then exercisable, at or prior to the earlier of (i) the
            close of business on June 17, 1998 (the "Final Expira-
            tion Date"), or (ii) the time at which the Rights are
            redeemed as provided in Section 23 hereof (the earlier
            of (i) and (ii) being herein referred to as the "Expira-
            tion Date").

                      (b)  The Purchase Price for each one one-
            hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock pursuant to the
            exercise of a Right shall initially be $200, shall be
            subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in
            Section 11 and Section 13(a) hereof and shall be payable
            in lawful money of the United States of America in
            accordance with paragraph (c) below.

                      (c)  Upon receipt of a Right Certificate
            representing exercisable Rights, with the form of elec-
            tion to purchase and the certificate duly executed,
            accompanied by payment, with respect to each Right so
            exercised, of the Purchase Price per one one-hundredth
            of a share of Preferred Stock (or other shares,
            securities or property, as the case may be) to be pur-
            chased, and an amount equal to any applicable transfer
            tax, in cash, or in the form of a certified check or
            money order payment to the order of the Company, the
            Rights Agent shall, subject to Section 20(k) hereof,
            thereupon promptly (i)(A) requisition from any transfer
            agent of the Preferred Stock (or make available, if the
            Rights Agent is the transfer agent therefor) certifi-
            cates for the total number of one one-hundredths of a
            share of Preferred Stock to be purchased and the Company
            hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer agent to
            comply with all such requests, or (B) if the Company
            shall have elected to deposit the total number of shares
            of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights
            hereunder with a depositary agent, requisition from the
            depositary agent depositary receipts representing such
            number of one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred
            Stock as are to be purchased (in which case certificates
            for the shares of Preferred Stock represented by such
            receipts shall be deposited by the transfer agent with
            the depositary agent) and the Company will direct the
            depositary agent to comply with such request, (ii)

                                        -11-

            requisition from the Company the amount of cash, if any,
            to be paid in lieu of issuance of fractional shares in
            accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) promptly after
            receipt of such certificates or depositary receipts,
            cause the same to be delivered to or upon the order of
            the registered holder of such Right Certificate,
            registered in such name or names as may be designated by
            such holder and (iv) after receipt thereof, promptly
            deliver such cash, if any, to or upon the order of the
            registered holder of such Right Certificate.  In the
            event that the Company is obligated to issue other
            securities (including Common Stock) of the Company, pay
            cash and/or distribute other property pursuant to Sec-
            tion 11(a) hereof, the Company will make all arrange-
            ments necessary so that such other securities, cash
            and/or other property are available for distribution by
            the Rights Agent, if and when appropriate.

                      (d)  In case the registered holder of any
            Right Certificate shall exercise less than all the
            Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate
            evidencing Rights equivalent to the Rights remaining
            unexercised shall be issued by the Rights Agent and
            delivered to, or upon the order of, the registered
            holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such
            name or names as may be designated by such holder,
            subject to the provisions of Section 14 hereof.

                    (e)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agree-
            ment to the contrary, from and after the first occur-
            rence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, any Rights benefi-
            cially owned by (i) an Acquiring Person or an Associate
            or Affiliate of an Acquiring Person, (ii) a transferee
            of an Acquiring Person (or of any such Associate or
            Affiliate) who becomes a transferee after the Acquiring
            Person becomes such or (iii) a transferee of an Acquir-
            ing Person (or of any such Associate or Affiliate) who
            becomes a transferee prior to or concurrently with the
            Acquiring Person becoming such and receives such Rights
            pursuant to either (A) a transfer (whether or not for
            consideration) from the Acquiring Person to holders of
            equity interests in such Acquiring Person or to any
            Person with whom the Acquiring Person has any continuing
            agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the
            transferred Rights or (B) a transfer which the Board of
            Directors of the Company has determined is part of a
            plan, arrangement or understanding which has as a
            primary purpose or effect the avoidance of this Section
            7(e), shall become null and void without any further

                                        -12-

            action and no holder of such Rights shall have any
            rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights, whether
            under any provision of this Agreement or otherwise.  The
            Company shall use all reasonable efforts to insure that
            the provisions of this Section 7(e) and Section 4(b)
            hereof are complied with, but shall have no liability to
            any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a
            result of its failure to make any determinations with
            respect to an Acquiring Person or its Affiliates and
            Associates or any transferee of any of them hereunder.

                      (f)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agree-
            ment to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the
            Company shall be obligated to undertake any action with
            respect to a registered holder of Rights upon the occur-
            rence of any purported exercise as set forth in this
            Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i)
            completed and signed the certificate contained in the
            form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse
            side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such
            exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of
            the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Benefi-
            cial Owner) or Affiliates or Associates thereof as the
            Company shall reasonably request.

                      Section 8.  Cancellation and Destruction of
            Right Certificates.  All Right Certificates surrendered
            for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, com-
            bination or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Com-
            pany or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights
            Agent for cancellation or in cancelled form, or, if
            surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be cancelled by
            it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu
            thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the
            provisions of this Agreement.  The Company shall deliver
            to the Rights Agent for cancellation and retirement, and
            the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other
            Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company
            otherwise than upon the exercise thereof.  The Rights
            Agent shall deliver all cancelled Right Certificates to
            the Company, or shall, at the written request of the
            Company, destroy such cancelled Right Certificates, and
            in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction
            thereof to the Company.

                      Section 9.  Reservation and Availability of
            Capital Stock.  (a)  The Company covenants and agrees
            that it will cause to be reserved and kept available out
            of its authorized and unissued shares of Preferred Stock

                                        -13-

            (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering Event,
            out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common
            Stock or other securities or out of its authorized and
            issued shares held in its treasury) the number of shares
            of Preferred Stock (and, following the occurrence of a
            Triggering Event, Common Stock or other securities)
            that, as provided in this Agreement, including Section
            11(a)(iii) hereof, will be sufficient to permit the
            exercise in full of all outstanding Rights.

                      (b)  So long as the Preferred Stock (and,
            following the occurrence of a Triggering Event, Common
            Stock and/or other securities) issuable and deliverable
            upon the exercise of Rights may be listed on any
            national securities exchange, the Company shall use its
            best efforts to cause, from and after such time as the
            Rights become exercisable, all shares reserved for such
            issuance to be listed on such exchange upon official
            notice of issuance upon such exercise.

                      (c)  The Company shall use its best efforts
            to (i) file, as soon as practicable following the ear-
            liest date after the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii)
            Event as of which the consideration to be delivered by
            the Company upon exercise of the Rights has been deter-
            mined in accordance with Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, or
            as soon as is required by law following the Distribution
            Date, as the case may be, a registration statement under
            the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), with
            respect to the securities purchasable upon exercise of
            the Rights on an appropriate form, (ii) cause such
            registration statement to become effective as soon as
            practicable after such filing and (iii) cause such
            registration statement to remain effective (with a
            prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the
            Act) until the earlier of (A) the date as of which the
            Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and
            (B) the date of the expiration of the Rights.  The
            Company will also take such action as may be appropriate
            under, or to ensure compliance with, the securities or
            "blue sky" laws of the various states in connection with
            the exercisability of the Rights.  The Company may
            temporarily suspend, for a period of time not to exceed
            90 days after the date set forth in clause (i) of the
            first sentence of this Section 9(c), the exercisability
            of the Rights in order to prepare and file such
            registration statement and permit it to become effec-
            tive.  Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue
            a public announcement stating that the exercisability of

                                        -14-

            the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a
            public announcement at such time as the suspension is no
            longer in effect.  Notwithstanding any such provision of
            this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be
            exercisable in any jurisdiction if the requisite
            qualification in such jurisdiction shall not have been
            obtained, the exercise thereof shall not be permitted
            under applicable law or a registration statement shall
            not have been declared effective.

                      (d)  The Company covenants and agrees that it
            will take all such action as may be necessary to insure
            that all one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred
            Stock (and, following the occurrence of a Triggering
            Event, Common Stock and/or other securities) delivered
            upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery
            of the certificates for such shares (subject to payment
            of the Purchase Price), be duly and validly authorized
            and issued and fully paid and nonassessable.

                      (e)  The Company further covenants and agrees
            that it will pay when due and payable any and all
            federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may
            be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the
            Right Certificates and of any certificates for shares of
            Preferred Stock (or Common Stock and/or other
            securities, as the case may be) upon the exercise of
            Rights.  The Company shall not, however, be required to
            pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of
            any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of
            Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the
            issuance or delivery of a number of one one-hundredths
            of a share of Preferred Stock (or Common Stock and/or
            other securities, as the case may be) in respect of a
            name other than that of, the registered holder of the
            Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for
            exercise or to issue or deliver any certificates for a
            number of one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred
            Stock (or Common Stock and/or other securities, as the
            case may be) in a name other than that of the registered
            holder upon the exercise of any Rights until any such
            tax shall have been paid (any such tax being payable by
            the holder of such Right Certificate at the time of
            surrender) or until it has been established to the
            Company's satisfaction that no such tax is due.

                      Section 10.  Preferred Stock Record Date.
            Each Person (other than the Company) in whose name any
            certificate for a number of one one-hundredths of a
            share of Preferred Stock (or Common Stock and/or other
            securities, as the case may be) is issued upon the
            exercise of Rights shall for all purposes be deemed to
            have become the holder of record of such fractional
            shares of Preferred Stock (or Common Stock and/or other
            securities, as the case may be) represented thereby on,
            and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon which
            the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly
            surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price (and any
            applicable transfer taxes) was made; provided, however,
            that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date
            upon which the Preferred Stock (or Common Stock and/or
            other securities, as the case may be) transfer books of
            the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to
            have become the record holder of such shares (fractional
            or otherwise) on, and such certificate shall be dated,
            the next succeeding Business Day on which the Preferred
            Stock (or Common Stock and/or other securities, as the
            case may be) transfer books of the Company are open.
            Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby,
            the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled
            to any rights of a stockholder of the Company with
            respect to shares for which the Rights shall be exer-
            cisable, including, without limitation, the right to
            vote, to receive dividends or other distributions or to
            exercise any preemptive rights, and shall not be
            entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the
            Company, except as provided herein.

                      Section 11.  Adjustment of Purchase Price,
            Number and Kind of Shares or Number of Rights.  The
            Purchase Price, the number and kind of shares covered by
            each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are
            subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in
            this Section 11.

                      (a)(i)  In the event the Company shall at any
            time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare a
            dividend on the Preferred Stock payable in shares of
            Preferred Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding Preferred
            Stock, (C) combine the outstanding Preferred Stock into
            a smaller number of shares or (D) issue any shares of
            its capital stock in a reclassification of the Preferred
            Stock (including any such reclassification in connection
            with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is
            the continuing or surviving corporation), except as

                                        -16-

            otherwise provided in this Section 11(a) and Section
            7(e) hereof, the Purchase Price in effect at the time of
            the record date for such dividend or of the effective
            date of such subdivision, combination or reclassifica-
            tion, and the number and kind of shares of Preferred
            Stock or capital stock, as the case may be, issuable on
            such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the
            holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be
            entitled to receive, upon payment of the Purchase Price
            then in effect, the aggregate number and kind of shares
            of Preferred Stock or capital stock, as the case may be,
            which, if such Right had been exercised immediately
            prior to such date and at a time when the Preferred
            Stock transfer books of the Company were open, he would
            have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to
            receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision, com-
            bination or reclassification.  If an event occurs which
            will require an adjustment under both this Section
            11(a)(i) and Section 11(a)(ii) hereof, the adjustment
            provided for in this Section 11(a)(i) shall be in addi-
            tion to, and shall be made prior to, any adjustment
            required pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof.

                      (ii)  In the event that any Person, alone or
            together with its Affiliates and Associates or other-
            wise, shall become an Acquiring Person, then proper
            provision shall promptly be made so that each holder of
            a Right, except as provided below and in Section 7(e)
            hereof, shall thereafter have a right to receive, upon
            exercise thereof at the then current Purchase Price in
            accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in lieu of
            Preferred Stock, such number of shares of Common Stock
            of the Company (the "Adjustment Shares") as shall equal
            the result obtained by (x) multiplying the then current
            Purchase Price by the number of one one-hundredths of a
            share of Preferred Stock for which a Right was exer-
            cisable immediately prior to the first occurrence of a
            Section 11(a)(ii) Event and (y) dividing that product
            (which, following such first occurrence, shall there-
            after be referred to as the "Purchase Price" for each
            Right and for all purposes of this Agreement) by 50% of
            the current market price per share of the Common Stock
            (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) on the date of the
            first occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event);
            provided, however, that if the transaction that would
            otherwise give rise to the foregoing adjustment is also
            subject to the provisions of Section 13 hereof, then
            only the provisions of Section 13 hereof shall apply and

                                        -17-

            no adjustment shall be made pursuant to this Section
            11(a)(ii).

                     (iii)  In the event that the number of shares
            of Common Stock which are authorized by the Company's
            certificate of incorporation but not outstanding or
            reserved for issuance for purposes other than upon
            exercise of the Rights is not sufficient to permit the
            exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with the
            foregoing subparagraph (ii) of this Section 11(a), the
            Company shall:  (A) determine the excess of (1) the
            value of the Adjustment Shares issuable upon the exer-
            cise of a Right (the "Current Value") over (2) the
            Purchase Price (such excess, the "Spread") and (B) with
            respect to each Right, make adequate provision to sub-
            stitute for the Adjustment Shares, upon payment of the
            applicable Purchase Price, (1) cash, (2) a reduction in
            the Purchase Price, (3) Common Stock or other equity
            securities of the Company (including, without limita-
            tion, shares, or units of shares, of preferred stock
            which the Board of Directors of the Company has deemed
            to have the same value as shares of Common Stock (such
            shares of preferred stock, "common stock equivalents")),
            (4) debt securities of the Company, (5) other assets or
            (6) any combination of the foregoing having an aggregate
            value equal to the Current Value, where such aggregate
            value has been determined by the Board of Directors of
            the Company based upon the advice of a nationally recog-
            nized investment banking firm selected by the Board of
            Directors of the Company; provided, however, if the
            Company shall not have made adequate provision to
            deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within 30
            days following the later of the first occurrence of a
            Section 11(a)(ii) Event and the first date that the
            right to redeem the Rights pursuant to Section 23 hereof
            shall expire, then the Company shall be obligated to
            deliver, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and
            without requiring payment of the Purchase Price, shares
            of Common Stock (to the extent available) and then, if
            necessary, cash, securities and/or assets in the
            aggregate equal in value (as determined by the Board of
            Directors of the Company based upon the advice of a
            nationally recognized investment banking firm selected
            by the Board of Directors of the Company) to the Spread.
            If the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine
            in good faith that it is likely that sufficient addi-
            tional Common Stock could be authorized for issuance
            upon exercise in full of the Rights, the 30 day period
            set forth above may be extended to the extent necessary,

                                        -18-

            but not more than 90 days following the first occurrence
            of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, in order that the Company
            may seek shareholder approval for the authorization of
            such additional shares (such period as it may be
            extended, the "Substitution Period").  To the extent
            that the Company determines that some action is to be
            taken pursuant to the first and/or second sentences of
            this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide,
            subject to Section 7(e) hereof, that such action shall
            apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights, and (y) may
            suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the
            expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek
            any authorization of additional shares and/or to decide
            the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant
            to such first sentence and to determine the value
            thereof.  In the event of any such suspension, the
            Company shall issue a public announcement stating that
            the exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily
            suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time
            as the suspension is no longer in effect.  For purposes
            of this Section 11(a)(iii), the value of the Common
            Stock shall be the current market price (as determined
            pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per share of the
            Common Stock on the later of the date of the first
            occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event and the first
            date that the right to redeem the Rights pursuant to
            Section 23 hereof shall expire and the value of any
            "common stock equivalent" shall be deemed to have the
            same value as the Common Stock on such date.

                      (b)  In case the Company shall fix a record
            date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to
            all holders of Preferred Stock entitling them to sub-
            scribe for or purchase (for a period expiring within 45
            calendar days after such record date) Preferred Stock
            (or securities having the same rights, privileges and
            preferences as the shares of Preferred Stock ("equiv-
            alent preferred stock")) or securities convertible into
            Preferred Stock or equivalent preferred stock at a price
            per share of Preferred Stock or per share of equivalent
            preferred stock (or having a conversion or exercise
            price per share, if a security convertible into or
            exercisable for Preferred Stock or equivalent preferred
            stock) less than the current market price (as determined
            pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per share of Preferred
            Stock on such record date, the Purchase Price to be in
            effect after such record date shall be determined by
            multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately
            prior to such date by a fraction, the numerator of which

                                        -19-

            shall be the number of shares of Preferred Stock out-
            standing on such record date, plus the number of shares
            of Preferred Stock which the aggregate offering price of
            the total number of shares of Preferred Stock and/or
            equivalent preferred stock so to be offered (and/or the
            aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible
            securities so to be offered) would purchase at such
            current market price and the denominator of which shall
            be the number of shares of Preferred Stock outstanding
            on such record date plus the number of additional shares
            of Preferred Stock and/or equivalent preferred stock
            to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into
            which the convertible securities so to be offered are
            initially convertible).  In case such subscription price
            may be paid by delivery of consideration part or all of
            which shall be in a form other than cash, the value of
            such consideration shall be as determined in good faith
            by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose deter-
            mination shall be described in a statement filed with
            the Rights Agent and shall be binding on the Rights
            Agent and the holders of Rights.  Shares of Preferred
            Stock owned by or held for the account of the Company
            shall not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any
            such computation.  Such adjustment shall be made succes-
            sively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the
            event that such rights or warrants are not so issued,
            the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase
            Price which would then be in effect if such record date
            had not been fixed.

                      (c)  In case the Company shall fix a record
            date for the making of a distribution to all holders of
            Preferred Stock (including any such distribution made in
            connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
            Company is the continuing corporation) of evidences of
            indebtedness, cash (other than a regular periodic cash
            dividend out of the earnings or retained earnings of the
            Company), assets (other than a dividend payable in
            Preferred Stock, but including any dividend payable in
            stock other than Preferred Stock) or convertible
            securities, subscription rights or warrants (excluding
            those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase
            Price to be in effect after such record date shall be
            determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect
            immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the
            numerator of which shall be the current market price (as
            determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per share
            of Preferred Stock on such record date, less the fair
            market value (as determined in good faith by the Board

                                        -20-

            of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall
            be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent)
            of the portion of the cash, assets or evidences of
            indebtedness so to be distributed or of such convertible
            securities, subscription rights or warrants applicable
            to one share of Preferred Stock and the denominator of
            which shall be such current market price (as determined
            pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) per share of Preferred
            Stock.  Such adjustments shall be made successively
            whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event
            that such distribution is not so made, the Purchase
            Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price
            which would then be in effect if such record date had
            not been fixed.

                      (d)(i)  For the purpose of any computation
            hereunder, other than computations made pursuant to
            Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, the "current market price"
            per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to
            be the average of the daily closing prices per share of
            such Common Stock for the 30 consecutive Trading Days
            (as such term is hereinafter defined) immediately prior
            to such date, and for purposes of computations made
            pursuant to Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, the "current
            market price" per share of the Common Stock on any date
            shall be deemed to be the average of the daily closing
            prices per share of such Common Stock for the 10 con-
            secutive Trading Days immediately following such date;
            provided, however, that in the event that the current
            market price per share of the Common Stock is determined
            during a period following the announcement by the issuer
            of such Common Stock of (A) a dividend or distribution
            on such Common Stock payable in shares of such Common
            Stock or securities convertible into shares of such
            Common Stock (other than the Rights), or (B) any sub-
            division, combination or reclassification of such Common
            Stock, and prior to the expiration of the requisite 30
            Trading Day or 10 Trading Day period, as set forth
            above, after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or
            distribution, or the record date for such subdivision,
            combination or reclassification, then, and in each such
            case, the "current market price" shall be properly
            adjusted to take into account ex-dividend trading.  The
            closing price for each day shall be the last sale price,
            regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on
            such day, the average of the closing bid and asked
            prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the
            principal consolidated transaction reporting system with
            respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on

                                        -21-

            the New York Stock Exchange or, if the shares of Common
            Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on the New
            York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal con-
            solidated transaction reporting system with respect to
            securities listed on the principal national securities
            exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed
            or admitted to trading or, if the shares of Common Stock
            are not listed or admitted to trading on any national
            securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so
            quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices
            in the over-the-counter market, as reported by the
            National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
            Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ") or such other
            system then in use, or, if on any such date the shares
            of Common Stock are not quoted by any such organization,
            the average of the closing bid and asked prices as
            furnished by a professional market maker making a market
            in the Common Stock selected by the Board of Directors
            of the Company.  If on any such date no market maker is
            making a market in the Common Stock, the fair value of
            such shares on such date as determined in good faith by
            the Board of Directors of the Company shall be used.
            The term "Trading Day" shall mean a day on which the
            principal national securities exchange on which the
            shares of Common Stock are listed or admitted to trading
            or traded is open for the transaction of business or, if
            the shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to
            trading on any national securities exchange, a Business
            Day.  If the Common Stock is not publicly held or not so
            listed or traded, "current market price" per share shall
            mean the fair value per share as determined in good
            faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, or, if
            at the time of such determination there is an Acquiring
            Person, by a majority of the Continuing Directors then
            in office, or if there are no Continuing Directors, by a
            nationally recognized investment banking firm selected
            by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be
            described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and
            shall be conclusive for all purposes.

                     (ii)  For the purpose of any computation
            hereunder, the "current market price" per share of
            Preferred Stock shall be determined in the same manner
            as set forth above for the Common Stock in clause (i) of
            this Section 11(d) (other than the last sentence
            thereof).  If the current market price per share of
            Preferred Stock cannot be determined in the manner
            described in clause (i) of this Section 11(d), the
            "current market price" per share of Preferred Stock

                                        -22-

            shall be conclusively deemed to be an amount equal to
            100 (as such number may be appropriately adjusted for
            such events as stock splits, stock dividends and
            recapitalizations with respect to the Common Stock
            occurring after the date of this Agreement) multiplied
            by the current market price per share of the Common
            Stock.  If neither the Common Stock nor the Preferred
            Stock is publicly held or so listed or traded, "current
            market price" per share of the Preferred Stock shall
            mean the fair value per share as determined in good
            faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, or, if
            at the time of such determination there is an Acquiring
            Person, by a majority of the Continuing Directors then
            in office, or if there are no Continuing Directors, by a
            nationally recognized investment banking firm selected
            by the Board of Directors, which determination shall be
            described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent and
            shall be conclusive for all purposes.  For all purposes
            of this Agreement, the "current market price" of one
            one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock shall be
            equal to the "current market price" of one share of
            Preferred Stock divided by 100.

                      (e)  Anything herein to the contrary not-
            withstanding, no adjustment in the Purchase Price shall
            be required unless such adjustment would require an
            increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Purchase
            Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by
            reason of this Section 11(e) are not required to be made
            shall be carried forward and taken into account in any
            subsequent adjustment.  All calculations under this
            Section 11 shall be made to the nearest cent or to the
            nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Common Stock or
            other share or one-millionth of a share of Preferred
            Stock, as the case may be.  Notwithstanding the first
            sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required
            by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the
            earlier of (i) three years from the date of the transac-
            tion which mandates such adjustment or (ii) the Expira-
            tion Date.

                      (f)  In the event that at any time, as a
            result of an adjustment made pursuant to Section
            11(a)(ii) or Section 13(a) hereof, the holder of any
            Right shall be entitled to receive upon exercise of such
            Right any shares of capital stock other than shares of
            Preferred Stock, thereafter the number of such other
            shares so receivable upon exercise of any Right and the
            Purchase Price thereof shall be subject to adjustment

                                        -23-

            from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly
            equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect
            to the Preferred Stock contained in Section 11(a), (b),
            (c), (e), (g), (h), (i), (j), (k) and (m), and the
            provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 with respect
            to the Preferred Stock shall apply on like terms to any
            such other shares.

                      (g)  All Rights originally issued by the
            Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Pur-
            chase Price hereunder shall evidence the right to pur-
            chase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of one
            one-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock purchasable
            from time to time hereunder upon exercise of the Rights,
            all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.

                       (h)  Unless the Company shall have exercised
            its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each
            adjustment of the Purchase Price as a result of the
            calculations made in Section 11(b) and (c), each Right
            outstanding immediately prior to the making of such
            adjustment shall thereafter evidence the right to
            purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number
            of one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock
            (calculated to the nearest one-millionth) obtained by
            (i) multiplying (x) the number of one one-hundredths of
            a share covered by a Right immediately prior to this
            adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect
            immediately prior to such adjustment of the Purchase
            Price and (ii) dividing the product so obtained by the
            Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjust-
            ment of the Purchase Price.

                      (i)  The Company may elect on or after the
            date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price to adjust
            the number of Rights, in lieu of any adjustment in the
            number of one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred
            Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right.  Each
            of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the
            number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of
            one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock for
            which such Right was exercisable immediately prior to
            such adjustment.  Each Right held of record prior to
            such adjustment of the number of Rights shall become
            that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest ten-
            thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase Price in
            effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase
            Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after
            adjustment of the Purchase Price.  The Company shall

                                   -24-

            make a public announcement of its election to adjust
            the number of Rights, indicating the record date for
            the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount
            of the adjustment to be made.  This record date may be
            the date on which the Purchase Price is adjusted or any
            day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have
            been issued, shall be at least 10 days later than the
            date of the public announcement.  If Right Certificates
            have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of
            Rights pursuant to this Section 11(i), the Company
            shall, as promptly as practicable, cause to be dis-
            tributed to holders of record of Right Certificates on
            such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject
            to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which
            such holders shall be entitled as a result of such
            adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall
            cause to be distributed to such holders of record in
            substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates
            held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment,
            and upon surrender thereof, if required by the Company,
            new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to
            which such holders shall be entitled after such adjust-
            ment.  Right Certificates so to be distributed shall be
            issued, executed and countersigned in the manner
            provided for herein (and may bear, at the option of the
            Company, the adjusted Purchase Price) and shall be
            registered in the names of the holders of record of
            Right Certificates on the record date specified in the
            public announcement.

                      (j)  Irrespective of any adjustment or change
            in the Purchase Price or the number of one one-
            hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock issuable upon
            the exercise of the Rights, the Right Certificates
            theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to
            express the Purchase Price per one one-hundredth of a
            share and the number of shares which were expressed in
            the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.

                      (k)  Before taking any action that would cause
            an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then
            par value of the number of one one-hundredths of a share
            of Preferred Stock issuable upon exercise of the Rights,
            the Company shall take any corporate action which may,
            in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order
            that the Company may validly and legally issue fully
            paid and nonassessable such number of one one-hundredths
            of a share of Preferred Stock at such adjusted Purchase
            Price.

                                   -25-

                      (l)  In any case in which this Section 11
            shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price
            be made effective as of a record date for a specified
            event, the Company may elect to defer until the occur-
            rence of such event the issuance to the holder of any
            Right exercised after such record date the number of
            one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock and
            other capital stock or securities of the Company, if
            any, issuable upon such exercise over and above the
            number of one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred
            Stock and other capital stock or securities of the
            Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the
            basis of the Purchase Price in effect prior to such
            adjustment; provided, however, that the Company shall
            deliver to such holder a due bill or other appropriate
            instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive
            such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event
            requiring such adjustment.

                      (m)  Anything in this Section 11 to the
            contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled
            to make such reductions in the Purchase Price, in
            addition to those adjustments expressly required by
            this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its
            sole discretion shall determine to be advisable in
            order that any consolidation or subdivision of the
            Preferred Stock, issuance wholly for cash of any
            Preferred Stock at less than the current market price,
            issuance wholly for cash of Preferred Stock or
            securities which by their terms are convertible into or
            exchangeable for Preferred Stock, stock dividends or
            issuance of rights, options or warrants referred to
            hereinabove in this Section 11, hereafter made by the
            Company to the holders of its Preferred Stock, shall
            not be taxable to such stockholders.

                      (n)  The Company covenants and agrees that it
            shall not at any time after the Distribution Date (i)
            consolidate with, (ii) merge with or into, or (iii)
            sell or transfer to, in one transaction or a series of
            related transactions, assets or earning power aggregat-
            ing more than 50% of the assets or earning power of the
            Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, any
            other Person or Persons if (x) at the time of or
            immediately after such consolidation, merger or sale
            there are any rights, warrants or other instruments
            outstanding or agreements or arrangements in effect which
            would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits
            intended to be afforded by the Rights or (y) prior to,

                                   -26-

            simultaneously with or immediately after such consolidation,
            merger or sale, the stockholders of a Person who constitutes, or
            would constitute, the "Principal Party" for the purposes of
            Section 13(a) hereof shall have received a distribution
            of Rights previously owned by such Person or any of its
            Affiliates and Associates.

                      (o)  The Company covenants and agrees that
            after the Distribution Date it will not, except as
            permitted by Section 23 or Section 26 hereof, take (or
            permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the
            time such action is taken it is reasonably foreseeable
            that such action will substantially diminish or other-
            wise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by
            the Rights.

                      (p)  Anything in this Agreement to the con-
            trary notwithstanding, in the event that the Company
            shall at any time after the date hereof and prior to
            the Distribution Date (i) declare a dividend on the
            outstanding shares of Common Stock payable in shares of
            Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common
            Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding Common Stock
            into a smaller number of shares, the number of Rights
            associated with each share of Common Stock then out-
            standing, or issued or delivered thereafter but prior
            to the Distribution Date, shall be proportionately
            adjusted so that the number of Rights thereafter
            associated with each share of Common Stock following
            any such event shall equal the result obtained by
            multiplying the number of Rights associated with each
            share of Common Stock immediately prior to such event
            by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the total
            number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
            immediately prior to the occurrence of the event and
            the denominator of which shall be the total number of
            shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately follow-
            ing the occurrence of such event.

                      Section 12. Certificate of Adjusted Purchase
            Price or Number of Shares.  Whenever an adjustment is
            made as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof, the
            Company shall (a) promptly prepare a certificate set-
            ting forth such adjustment and a brief statement of the
            facts accounting for such adjustment, (b) promptly file
            with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for
            the Preferred Stock and the Common Stock a copy of such
            certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof to each
            holder of a Right Certificate (or, if prior to the

                                   -27-

            Distribution Date, to each holder of a certificate
            representing shares of Common Stock) in accordance with
            Section 25 hereof.  The Rights Agent shall be fully
            protected in relying on any such certificate and on any
            adjustment therein contained.

                      Section 13.  Consolidation, Merger or Sale or
            Transfer of Assets or Earning Power.  (a)  In the event
            that, following the Stock Acquisition Date, directly or
            indirectly, (i) the Company shall consolidate with, or
            merge with and into, any other Person, and the Company
            shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation of
            such consolidation or merger, (ii) any Person shall
            merge with and into the Company, and the Company shall
            be the continuing or surviving corporation of such
            merger and, in connection with such merger, all or part
            of the Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged
            for stock or other securities of any other Person or
            cash or any other property, or (iii) the Company shall
            sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its
            Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one
            transaction or a series of related transactions, assets
            or earning power aggregating more than 50% of the
            assets or earning power of the Company and its Sub-
            sidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person or
            Persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision
            shall be made so that:  (w) each holder of a Right,
            except as provided in Section 7(e) hereof, shall there-
            after have the right to receive, upon the exercise
            thereof at the then current Purchase Price (without
            giving effect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price
            pursuant to Section 11(b)) in accordance with the terms
            of this Agreement, such number of validly authorized
            and issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
            freely tradeable Common Stock of the Principal Party
            (as hereinafter defined), not subject to any rights of
            call or first refusal, liens, encumbrances or other
            claims, as shall be equal to the result obtained by (1)
            multiplying the then current Purchase Price (without
            giving effect to any adjustment to the Purchase Price
            pursuant to Section 11(b)) by the then number of one
            one-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock for which
            a Right is exercisable immediately prior to the first
            occurrence of any event described in Section 13(a)(i),
            (ii) or (iii) hereof (or, if a Section 11(a)(ii) Event
            has occurred prior to the first occurrence of any event
            referred to in Section 13(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) hereof,
            multiplying the number of such 1/100ths of a share for
            which a Right was exercisable immediately
            prior to the first occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii)

                                   -28-

            Event by the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior
            to such first occurrence) and dividing that product
            (which, following the first occurrence of any event
            referred to in Section 13(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), shall
            be referred to as the "Purchase Price" for each Right and
            for all purposes of this Agreement) by (2) 50% of the current
            market price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i)
            hereof) per share of the Common Stock of such Principal
            Party on the date of consummation of such consolida-
            tion, merger, sale or transfer;  (x) the Principal
            Party shall thereafter be liable for, and shall assume,
            by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or trans-
            fer, all the obligations and duties of the Company
            pursuant to this Agreement; (y) the term "Company"
            shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal
            Party, it being specifically intended that the provi-
            sions of Section 11 hereof shall apply to such Prin-
            cipal Party and (z) such Principal Party shall take
            such steps (including, but not limited to, the
            authorization and reservation of a sufficient number of
            shares of its Common Stock to permit exercise of all
            outstanding Rights in accordance with this Section
            13(a)) in connection with such consummation as may be
            necessary to assure that the provisions hereof shall
            thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may
            be, in relation to the shares of its Common Stock
            thereafter deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights.

                      (b)  "Principal Party" shall mean

                      (1) in the case of any transaction
                 described in clause (i) or (ii) of the first
                 sentence of Section 13(a), the Person that is
                 the issuer of any securities into which
                 shares of Common Stock of the Company are
                 converted in such merger or consolidation,
                 and if no securities are so issued, the
                 Person that is the other party to the merger
                 or consolidation; and

                      (2) in the case of any transaction
                 described in clause (iii) of the first sen-
                 tence of Section 13(a), the Person that is
                 the party receiving the greatest portion of
                 the assets or earning power transferred
                 pursuant to such transaction or transactions;

                                   -29-

                 provided, however, that in any such case, (x) if the
                 Common Stock of such Person is not at such time and has
                 not been continuously over the preceding 12-month
                 period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act,
                 and such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary of
                 another Person the Common Stock of which is and has
                 been so registered, "Principal Party" shall refer to
                 such other Person; and (y) in case such Person is a
                 Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one
                 Person, the Common Stocks of two or more of which are
                 and have been so registered, "Principal Party" shall
                 refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of the
                 Common Stock having the greatest aggregate market
                 value.

                      (c)  The Company shall not consummate any
                 such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer unless the
                 Principal Party shall have a sufficient number of
                 authorized shares of its Common Stock which have not
                 been issued or reserved for issuance to permit the
                 exercise in full of the Rights in accordance with this
                 Section 13 and unless prior thereto the Company and
                 such Principal Party shall have executed and delivered
                 to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing
                 for the terms set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
                 this Section 13 and further providing that, as soon as
                 practicable after the date of any consolidation, merger
                 or sale of assets mentioned in paragraph (a) of this
                 Section 13, the Principal Party will

                      (i) prepare and file a registration
                 statement under the Act with respect to the
                 Rights and the securities purchasable upon
                 exercise of the Rights on an appropriate
                 form, will use its best efforts to cause such
                 registration statement to become effective as
                 soon as practicable after such filing and
                 will use its best efforts to cause such
                 registration statement to remain effective
                 (with a prospectus at all times meeting the
                 requirements of the Act) until the Expiration
                 Date; and

                     (ii) will deliver to holders of the
                 Rights historical financial statements for
                 the Principal Party and each of its
                 Affiliates which comply in all respects with
                 the requirements for registration on Form 10
                 under the Exchange Act.

                                   -30-

            The provisions of this Section 13 shall similarly apply
            to successive mergers or consolidations or sales or
            other transfers.  If any event described in Section
            13(a)(i), (ii) or (iii) shall occur at any time after
            the occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event, the Rights
            which have not theretofore been exercised shall there-
            after become exercisable in the manner described in
            Section 13(a).

                      Section 14.  Fractional Rights and Fractional
            Shares.  (a) The Company shall not be required to issue
            fractions of Rights, except prior to the Distribution
            Date as provided in Section 11(p) hereof, or to dis-
            tribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional
            Rights.  In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall
            be paid to the registered holders of the Right Certifi-
            cates with regard to which such fractional Rights would
            otherwise be issuable, an amount in cash equal to the
            same fraction of the current market value of a whole
            Right.  For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the
            current market value of a whole Right shall be the
            closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day
            immediately prior to the date on which such fractional
            Rights would have been otherwise issuable.  The closing
            price of the Rights for any day shall be the last sale
            price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes
            place on such day, the average of the closing bid and
            asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported
            in the principal consolidated transaction reporting
            system with respect to securities listed or admitted to
            trading on the New York Stock Exchange or, if the
            Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New
            York Stock Exchange, as reported in the principal
            consolidated transaction reporting system with respect
            to securities listed on the principal national
            securities exchange on which the Rights are listed or
            admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or
            admitted to trading on any national securities
            exchange, the last quoted price, or, if not so quoted,
            the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the
            over-the-counter market, as reported by NASDAQ or such
            other system then in use or, if on any such date the
            Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the
            average of the closing bid and asked prices as fur-
            nished by a professional market maker making a market
            in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the
            Company.  If on any such date no such market maker is
            making a market in the Rights the fair value of the
            Rights on such date as determined in good

                                   -31-


            faith by the Board of Directors of the Company shall be
            used.

                      (b)  The Company shall not be required to
            issue fractions of shares of Preferred Stock (other
            than fractions which are integral multiples of one
            one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock) upon
            exercise of the Rights or to distribute certificates
            which evidence fractional shares of Preferred Stock
            (other than fractions which are integral multiples of
            one one-hundredth of a share of Preferred Stock).  In
            lieu of fractional shares of Preferred Stock that are
            not integral multiples of one one-hundredth of a share
            of Preferred Stock, the Company may pay to the
            registered holders of Right Certificates at the time
            such Right Certificates are exercised as herein
            provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction
            of the current market value of one one-hundredth of a
            share of Preferred Stock.  For purposes of this Section
            14(b), the current market value of one one-hundredth of
            a share of Preferred Stock shall be one one-hundredth
            of the closing price of a share of Preferred Stock (as
            determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(ii) hereof) for
            the Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such
            exercise.

                      (c)  Following the occurrence of any Trigger-
            ing Event, the Company shall not be required to issue
            fractions of shares of Common Stock upon exercise of
            the Rights or to distribute certificates which evidence
            fractional shares of Common Stock.  In lieu of frac-
            tional shares of Common Stock, the Company may pay to
            the registered holders of Right Certificates at the
            time such Right Certificates are exercised as herein
            provided an amount in cash equal to the same fraction
            of the current market value of one share of Common
            Stock.  For purposes of this Section 14(c), the current
            market value of one share of Common Stock shall be the
            closing price of one share of Common Stock (as deter-
            mined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i) hereof) for the
            Trading Day immediately prior to the date of such
            exercise.

                      (d)  The holder of a Right by the acceptance
            of the Rights expressly waives his right to receive any
            fractional Rights or any fractional share upon exercise
            of Rights, except as permitted by this Section 14.

                                   -32-

                      Section 15. Rights of Action.  All rights of
            action in respect of this Agreement are vested in the
            respective registered holders of the Right Certificates
            (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered
            holders of Common Stock); and any registered holder of
            any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution
            Date, of the Common Stock), without the consent of the
            Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Cer-
            tificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the
            Common Stock), may, in his own behalf and for his own
            benefit, enforce, and may institute and maintain any
            suit, action or proceeding against the Company to
            enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to
            exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate
            in the manner provided in such Right Certificate and in
            this Agreement.  Without limiting the foregoing or any
            remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is
            specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights
            would not have an adequate remedy at law for any breach
            of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific
            performance of the obligations under, and injunctive
            relief against actual or threatened violations of the
            obligations of, any Person subject to this Agreement.

                      Section 16. Agreement of Right Holders.
            Every holder of a Right by accepting the same consents
            and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and
            with every other holder of a Right that:

                      (a)  prior to the Distribution Date, the
            Rights will be transferable only in connection with the
            transfer of Common Stock;

                      (b)  after the Distribution Date, the Right
            Certificates are transferable only on the registry
            books of the Rights Agent if surrendered at the prin-
            cipal office or offices of the Rights Agent designated
            for such purposes, duly endorsed or accompanied by a
            proper instrument of transfer and with the appropriate
            certificates fully executed;

                      (c)  subject to Section 6(a) and Section 7(f)
            hereof, the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and
            treat the Person in whose name the Right Certificate
            (or, prior to the Distribution Date, the associated
            Common Stock certificate) is registered as the absolute
            owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby

            or the Rights Agent) for all purposes whatsoever, and
            neither the Company nor the Rights Agent, subject to
            the last sentence of Section 7(e) hereof, shall be
            affected by any notice to the contrary; and

                      (d)  notwithstanding anything in this Agree-
            ment to the contrary, neither the Company nor the
            Rights Agent shall have any liability to any holder of
            a Right or other Person as a result of its inability to
            perform any of its obligations under this Agreement by
            reason of any preliminary or permanent injunction or
            other order, decree or ruling issued by a court of
            competent jurisdiction or by a governmental, regulatory
            or administrative agency or commission, or any statute,
            rule, regulation or executive order promulgated or
            enacted by any governmental authority prohibiting or
            otherwise restraining performance of such obligation;
            provided, however, the Company must use its best
            efforts to have any such order, decree or ruling lifted
            or otherwise overturned as soon as possible.

                      Section 17. Right Certificate Holder Not
            Deemed a Stockholder.  No holder, as such, of any Right
            Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive
            dividends or be deemed for any purpose the holder of
            the number of one one-hundredths of a share of
            Preferred Stock or any other securities of the Company
            which may at any time be issuable on the exercise of
            the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything
            contained herein or in any Right Certificate be con-
            strued to confer upon the holder of any Right Certifi-
            cate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of
            the Company or any right to vote for the election of
            directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders
            at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent
            to any corporate action, or to receive notice of meet-
            ings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as
            provided in Section 24), or to receive dividends or
            subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Right or
            Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have
            been exercised in accordance with the provisions
            hereof.

                      Section 18. Concerning the Rights Agent.  (a)
            The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent
            reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it
            hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of the
            Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees
            and disbursements and other disbursements incurred in the

                                   -34-

            administration and execution of this Agreement and the
            exercise and performance of its duties hereunder.  The
            Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for,
            and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability,
            or expense, incurred without negligence, bad faith or
            willful misconduct on the part of the Rights Agent, for
            anything done or omitted by the Rights Agent in connec-
            tion with the acceptance and administration of this
            Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defend-
            ing against any claim of liability.

                      (b)  The Rights Agent shall be protected and
            shall incur no liability for or in respect of any
            action taken, suffered or omitted by it in connection
            with its administration of this Agreement in reliance
            upon any Right Certificate or certificate for Common
            Stock or for other securities of the Company, instru-
            ment of assignment or transfer, power of attorney,
            endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction,
            consent, certificate, statement, or other paper or
            document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed,
            executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowl-
            edged, by the proper Person or Persons.

                      Section 19.  Merger or Consolidation or
            Change of Name of Rights Agent.  (a)  Any corporation
            into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights
            Agent may be merged or with which it may be con-
            solidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger
            or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any
            successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any cor-
            poration succeeding to the corporate trust or stock
            transfer business of the Rights Agent or any successor
            Rights Agent, shall be the successor to the Rights
            Agent under this Agreement without the execution or
            filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
            any of the parties hereto, provided that such corpora-
            tion would be eligible for appointment as a successor
            Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21.  In
            case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall
            succeed to the agency created by this Agreement, any of
            the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned
            but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may
            adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights
            Agent and deliver such Right Certificates so counter-
            signed; and in case at that time any of the Right
            Certificates shall not have been countersigned, any
            successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right
            Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights
            Agent or in the name of the successor Rights Agent; and
            in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the

                                   -35-

            full force provided in the Right Certificates and in
            this Agreement.

                      (b)  In case at any time the name of the
            Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of
            the Right Certificates shall have been countersigned
            but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the
            countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right
            Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time
            any of the Right Certificates shall not have been
            countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such
            Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its
            changed name; and in all such cases such Right Certifi-
            cates shall have the full force provided in the Right
            Certificates and in this Agreement.

                      Section 20. Duties of Rights Agent.  The
            Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations
            imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms and
            conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders
            of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof,
            shall be bound:

                      (a)  The Rights Agent may consult with legal
            counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and
            the opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete
            authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to
            any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in
            accordance with such opinion.

                      (b)  Whenever in the performance of its
            duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem
            it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter
            (including, without limitation, the identity of any
            "Acquiring Person" and the determination of "current
            market price") be proved or established by the Company
            prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such
            fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect
            thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be
            deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a
            certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board, the
            President or any Vice President and by the Treasurer or
            any Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or any Assis-
            tant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the
            Rights Agent; and such certificate shall be full
            authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken
            or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of
            this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.

                                   -36-

                      (c)  The Rights Agent shall be liable
            hereunder only for its own negligence, bad faith or
            willful misconduct.

                      (d)  The Rights Agent shall not be liable for
            or by reason of any of the statements of fact or reci-
            tals contained in this Agreement or in the Right Cer-
            tificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be
            required to verify the same, but all such statements
            and recitals are and shall be deemed to have been made
            by the Company only.

                      (e)  The Rights Agent shall not be under any
            responsibility in respect of the validity of this
            Agreement or the execution and delivery hereof (except
            the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in
            respect of the validity or execution of any Right
            Certificate (except its countersignature thereof); nor
            shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company
            of any covenant or condition contained in this Agree-
            ment or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be
            responsible for any change in the exercisability of the
            Rights (including the Rights becoming void pursuant to
            Section 7(e) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of
            the Rights (including the manner, method or amount
            thereof) provided for in Sections 3, 11, 13 or 23, or
            the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would
            require any such adjustment (except with respect to the
            exercise of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates
            after actual notice of any such adjustment); nor shall
            it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any repre-
            sentation or warranty as to the authorization or reser-
            vation of any shares of Common Stock or Preferred Stock
            to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right
            Certificate or as to whether any shares of Common Stock
            or Preferred Stock will, when issued, be validly
            authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

                      (f)  The Company agrees that it will perform,
            execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be per-
            formed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such
            further and other acts, instruments and assurances as
            may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the
            carrying out or performing by the Rights Agent of the
            provisions of this Agreement.

                                   -37- 

                      (g)  The Rights Agent is hereby authorized
            and directed to accept instructions with respect to the
            performance of its duties hereunder from the Chairman
            of the Board, the President or any Vice President or
            the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary or the
            Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the Company,
            and to apply to such officers for advice or instruc-
            tions in connection with its duties, and it shall not
            be liable for any action taken or suffered to be taken
            by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of
            any such officer.

                      (h)  The Rights Agent and any shareholder,
            director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may
            buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights or other
            securities of the Company or become pecuniarily inter-
            ested in any transaction in which the Company may be
            interested, or contract with or lend money to the
            Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though
            it were not the Rights Agent under this Agreement.
            Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from
            acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any
            other legal entity.

                      (i)  The Rights Agent may execute and exer-
            cise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or
            perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or
            through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent
            shall not be answerable or accountable for any act,
            default, neglect or misconduct of any such attorneys or
            agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from
            any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided
            reasonable care was exercised in the selection and
            continued employment thereof.

                      (j)  No provision of this Agreement shall
            require the Rights Agent to expend or risk its own
            funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
            performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the
            exercise of its rights if there shall be reasonable
            grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
            adequate indemnification against such risk or liability
            is not reasonably assured to it.

                      (k)  If, with respect to any Right Certifi-
            cate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or
            transfer, the certificate attached to the form of
            assignment or form of election to purchase, as the
            cases may be, has either not been completed or indicates an
            affirmative response to clause 1 and/or 2 thereof, the Rights

                                   -38-

            Agent shall not take any further action with respect to such
            requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the
            Company.

                      Section 21. Change of Rights Agent.  The
            Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign
            and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement
            upon 30 days' notice in writing mailed to the Company
            and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock and
            Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail, and,
            subsequent to the Distribution Date, to the holders of
            the Right Certificates by first-class mail.  The Com-
            pany may remove the Rights Agent or any successor
            Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice in writing, mailed to
            the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case
            may be, and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock
            and Preferred Stock by registered or certified mail,
            and, subsequent to the Distribution Date, to the
            holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail.
            If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall
            otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall
            appoint a successor to the Rights Agent.  If the Com-
            pany shall fail to make such appointment within a
            period of 30 days after such removal or after it has
            been notified in writing of such resignation or
            incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights
            Agent or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who
            shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate
            for inspection by the Company), then the registered
            holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court
            of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new
            Rights Agent.  Any successor Rights Agent, whether
            appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be
            (a) a corporation organized and doing business under
            the laws of the United States or of any state of the
            United States, in good standing, having a principal
            office in the State of New York, which is authorized
            under such laws to exercise stock transfer or corporate
            trust powers and is subject to supervision or examina-
            tion by federal or state authority and which has at the
            time of its appointment as Rights Agent a combined
            capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (b) an
            Affiliate of a corporation described in clause (a) of
            this sentence.  After appointment, the successor Rights
            Agent shall be vested with the same powers, rights,
            duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally
            named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the
            predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the
            successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it

                                   -39-

            hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance,
            conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.  Not later
            than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company
            shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor
            Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common
            Stock and the Preferred Stock, and, subsequent to the
            Distribution Date, mail a notice thereof in writing to
            the registered holders of the Right Certificates.
            Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section
            21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect
            the legality or validity of the resignation or removal
            of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor
            Rights Agent, as the case may be.

                      Section 22.  Issuance of New Right Certifi-
            cates.  Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this
            Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company
            may, at its option, issue new Right Certificates
            evidencing Rights in such form as may be approved by
            its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment or
            change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or
            class of shares of stock or other securities or
            property purchasable under the Right Certificates made
            in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
            In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of
            shares of Common Stock following the Distribution Date
            and prior to the redemption or expiration of the
            Rights, the Company (a) shall, with respect to shares
            of Common Stock so issued or sold pursuant to the
            exercise of warrants, stock options or under or to any
            employee plan, profit sharing trust or other arrange-
            ment, or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of
            securities outstanding on the date hereof or hereafter
            issued by the Company, and (b) may, in any other case,
            if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board of
            Directors of the Company, issue Right Certificates
            representing the appropriate number of Rights in con-
            nection with such issuance or sale; provided, however,
            that (i) no such Right Certificate shall be issued if,
            and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by
            counsel that such issuance would create a significant
            risk of material adverse tax consequences to the Com-
            pany or the person to whom such Right Certificate would
            be issued, and (ii) no such Right Certificate shall be
            issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjust-
            ment shall otherwise have been made in lieu of the
            issuance thereof.

                                   -40-

                      Section 23.  Redemption.  (a)  The Board of
            Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any
            time prior to the earlier of (i) the close of business
            on the tenth day after the Stock Acquisition Date (or
            such later date as a majority of the Continuing Direc-
            tors then in office may determine) or (ii) the Final
            Expiration Date, elect to redeem all but not less than
            all the then outstanding Rights at a redemption price
            of $.01 per Right appropriately adjusted to reflect any
            stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction
            occurring after the date hereof (such redemption price
            being hereinafter referred to as the "Redemption
            Price"); provided, however, that if the Board of Direc-
            tors of the Company authorizes redemption of the Rights
            at or after the time a Person becomes an Acquiring
            Person, then there must be Continuing Directors then in
            office and such authorization shall require the concur-
            rence of a majority of such Continuing Directors.
            Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
            contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable after the
            first occurrence of a Section 11(a)(ii) Event until
            such time as the Company's right of redemption
            hereunder has expired.

                      (b)  Immediately upon the action of the Board
            of Directors of the Company electing to redeem the
            Rights, evidence of which shall have been filed with
            the Rights Agent, and without any further action and
            without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights
            will terminate and the only right thereafter of the
            holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption
            Price for each Right so held.  Promptly after the
            action of the Board of Directors ordering the redemp-
            tion of the Rights, the Company shall give notice of
            such redemption to the Rights Agent and the holders of
            the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice to
            all such holders at their last addresses as they appear
            upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or, prior
            to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the
            Transfer Agent for the Common Stock.  Any notice which
            is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be deemed
            given, whether or not the holder receives the notice.
            Each such notice of redemption will state the method by
            which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.
            Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates or
            Associates may redeem, acquire or purchase for value
            any Rights at any time in any manner other than that
            specifically set forth in this Section 23, and other
            than in connection with the purchase, acquisition or
            redemption of shares of Common Stock prior to the
            Distribution Date.

                      Section 24. Notice of Proposed Actions.  (a)
            In case the Company shall propose, at any time after
            the Distribution Date, (i) to pay any dividend payable
            in stock of any class to the holders of Preferred Stock
            or to make any other distribution to the holders of
            Preferred Stock (other than a regular quarterly cash
            dividend out of earnings or retained earnings of the
            Company), or (ii) to offer to the holders of its
            Preferred Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or
            to purchase any additional shares of Preferred Stock or
            shares of stock of any class or any other securities,
            rights or options, or (iii) to effect any reclassifica-
            tion of its Preferred Stock (other than a reclassifica-
            tion involving only the subdivision of outstanding
            shares of Preferred Stock), or (iv) to effect any
            consolidation or merger into or with any other Person,
            or to effect any sale or other transfer (or to permit
            one or more of its Subsidiaries to effect any sale or
            other transfer), in one transaction or a series of
            related transactions, of more than 50% of the assets or
            earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries
            (taken as a whole) to any other Person or Persons, or
            (v) to effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding
            up of the Company, then, in each such case, the Company
            shall give to each holder of a Right, to the extent
            feasible and in accordance with Section 25, a notice of
            such proposed action, which shall specify the record
            date for the purposes of such stock dividend, distribu-
            tion of rights or warrants, or the date on which such
            reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, trans-
            fer, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take
            place and the date of participation therein by the
            holders of Preferred Stock, if any such date is to be
            fixed, and such notice shall be so given in the case of
            any action covered by clause (i) or (ii) above at least
            20 days prior to the record date for determining
            holders of the Preferred Stock for purposes of such
            action, and in the case of any such other action, at
            least 20 days prior to the date of the taking of such
            proposed action or the date of participation therein by
            the holders of Preferred Stock, whichever shall be the
            earlier.  The failure to give notice required by this
            Section 24 or any defect therein shall not affect the
            legality or validity of the action taken by the Company
            or the vote upon any such action.

                                   -41-

                      (b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agree-
            ment to the contrary, prior to the Distribution Date a
            filing by the Company with the Securities and Exchange
            Commission shall constitute sufficient notice to the
            holders of securities of the Company, including the
            Rights, for purposes of this Agreement and no other
            notice need be given.

                      (c)  In case any Section 11(a)(ii) Event
            shall occur, then, in any such case, (i) the Company
            shall as soon as practicable thereafter give to each
            holder of a Right Certificate, in accordance with
            Section 25 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such
            event, which shall specify the event and the consequences
            of the event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii)
            hereof and (ii) all references in subsection (a) to
            Preferred Stock shall be deemed thereafter to refer
            to Common Stock and/or, if appropriate, other securities.

                      Section 26. Supplements and Amendments.
            Prior to the Distribution Date and subject to the
            penultimate sentence of this Section 26, the Company
            and the Rights Agent shall, if the Company so directs,
            supplement or amend any provision of this Agreement
            without the approval of any holders of certificates
            representing shares of Common Stock.  From and after
            the Distribution Date and subject to the penultimate
            sentence of this Section 26, the Company and the Rights
            Agent shall, if the Company so directs, supplement or
            amend this Agreement without the approval of any
            holders of Rights Certificates in order (i) to cure any
            ambiguity, (ii) to correct or supplement any provision
            contained herein which may be defective or inconsistent
            with any other provisions herein, (iii) to shorten or
            lengthen any time period hereunder (which shortening or
            lengthening shall be effective only if there are Con-
            tinuing Directors then in office and shall require the
            concurrence of a majority of such Continuing Directors
            if such supplement or amendment occurs at or after the
            time a Person becomes an Acquiring Person) or (iv) to
            change or supplement the provisions hereof in any
            manner which the Company may deem necessary or
            desirable and which shall not adversely affect the
            interests of the holders of Rights Certificates (other
            than an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate
            of an Acquiring Person); provided, however, that this
            Agreement may not be supplemented or amended to
            lengthen, pursuant to clause (iii) of this sentence,
            (A) a time period relating to when the Rights may be
            redeemed at such time as the Rights are not then
            redeemable or (B) any other time period unless such
            lengthening is for the purpose of protecting, enhancing
            or clarifying the rights of, and/or the benefits to,
            the holders of Rights.  Upon the delivery of a certifi-
            cate from an appropriate officer of the Company which
            states that the proposed supplement or amendment is in
            compliance with the terms of this Section 26, the
            Rights Agent shall execute such supplement or amend-
            ment.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this
            Agreement to the contrary, no supplement or amendment
            shall be made which changes the Redemption Price, the
            Final Expiration Date, the Purchase Price or the number
            of one one-hundredths of a share of Preferred Stock for
            which a Right is exercisable.  Prior to the

                                   -44-

            Distribution Date, the interests of the holders of Rights
            shall be deemed coincident with the interests of the holders
            of Common Stock.

                      Section 27. Successors.  All the covenants
            and provisions of this Agreement by or for the benefit
            of the Company or the Rights Agent shall bind and inure
            to the benefit of their respective successors and
            assigns hereunder.

                      Section 28.  Determinations and Actions by
            the Board of Directors, etc.  For all purposes of this
            Agreement, any calculation of the number of shares of
            Common Stock outstanding at any particular time,
            including for purposes of determining the particular
            percentage of such outstanding shares of Common Stock
            of which any Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall be
            made in accordance with the last sentence of Rule 13d-
            3(d)(1)(i) of the General Rules and Regulations under
            the Exchange Act.  The Board of Directors of the Com-
            pany (with, where specifically provided for herein, the
            concurrence of the Continuing Directors) shall have the
            exclusive power and authority to administer this Agree-
            ment and to exercise all rights and powers specifically
            granted to the Board (with, where specifically provided
            for herein, the concurrence of the Continuing Direc-
            tors) or to the Company, or as may be necessary or
            advisable in the administration of this Agreement,
            including without limitation, the right and power to
            (i) interpret the provisions of this Agreement and (ii)
            make all determinations deemed necessary or advisable
            for the administration of this Agreement (including a
            determination to redeem or not redeem the Rights or to
            amend the Agreement).  All such actions, calculations,
            interpretations and determinations (including, for
            purposes of clause (y) below, all omissions with
            respect to the foregoing) which are done or made by the
            Board (or, where specifically provided for herein, by
            the Continuing Directors) in good faith, shall (x) be
            final, conclusive and binding on the Company, the
            Rights Agent, the holders of the Rights and all other
            parties, and (y) not subject to the Board or the Con-
            tinuing Directors to any liability to the holders of
            the Right.

                      Section 29. Benefits of This Agreement.
            Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to give to
            any Person other than the Company, the Rights Agent and
            the registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior
            to the Distribution Date, the Common Stock) any legal or

                                   -45-

            equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement; but
            this Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit
            of the Company, the Rights Agent and the registered holders
            of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date,    
            the Common Stock).

                      Section 30. Severability.  If any term,
            provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is
            held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
            authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
            remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
            restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
            force and effect and shall in no way be affected,
            impaired or invalidated.

                      Section 31.  GOVERNING LAW.  THIS AGREEMENT,
            EACH RIGHT AND EACH RIGHT CERTIFICATE ISSUED HEREUNDER
            SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE A CONTRACT MADE UNDER THE LAWS OF
            THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND FOR ALL PURPOSES SHALL BE
            GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS
            OF SUCH STATE APPLICABLE TO CONTRACTS TO BE MADE AND
            PERFORMED ENTIRELY WITHIN SUCH STATE, EXCEPT THAT THE
            RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE RIGHTS AGENT SHALL BE
            GOVERNED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

                      Section 32. Counterparts.  This Agreement may
            be executed in any number of counterparts and each of
            such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to
            be an original, and all such counterparts shall
            together constitute one and the same instrument.

                                   -46-

                      Section 33. Descriptive Headings.  The cap-
            tions herein and table of contents hereto are included
            for convenience of reference only, do not constitute a
            part of this Agreement and shall be ignored in the
            construction and interpretation hereof.

                      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have
            caused this Agreement to be duly executed, all as of
            the day and year first above written.

            series shall be 1,500,000.

                      Section 2.  Dividends and Distributions.

                      (A)  Subject to the prior and superior rights of
            the holders of any shares of any series of Preferred Stock


            ranking prior and superior to the Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, the holders of
            shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, in
            preference to the shares of Common Stock, par value $1 per
            share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), and any other
            stock of the Company junior to the Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, shall be entitled
            to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Direc-
            tors out of funds legally available for the purpose,
            quarterly dividends payable in cash on the fourth Monday of
            January, April, July and October in each year (each such date
            being referred to herein as a "Quarterly Dividend Payment
            Date"), commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment
            Date after the first issuance of a share or fraction of a
            share of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, in an
            amount per share (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the
            greater of (a) $1.00 or (b) subject to the provision for
            adjustment hereinafter set forth, 100 times the aggregate per
            share amount of all cash dividends, and 100 times the
            aggregate per share amount (payable in kind) of all non-cash
            dividends or other distributions other than a dividend pay-
            able in shares of Common Stock or a subdivision of the out-
            standing shares of Common Stock (by reclassification or
            otherwise), declared on the Common Stock since the
            immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or,
            with respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date,
            since the first issuance of any share or fraction of a share
            of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock.  In the event
            the Company shall at any time after June 17, 1988 (the
            "Rights Declaration Date") (i) declare or pay any dividend on
            Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) sub-
            divide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the
            outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
            then in each such case the amount to which holders of shares
            of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock were entitled
            immediately prior to such event under clause (b) of the
            preceding sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such
            amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
            shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such
            event and the denominator of which is the number of shares of
            Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such
            event.

                      (B)  The Company shall declare a dividend or dis-
            tribution on the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock as
            provided in paragraph (A) above immediately after it declares
            a dividend or distribution on the Common Stock (other than a
            dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); provided that,
            in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been


                                         -2-

            declared on the Common Stock during the period between any
            Quarterly Dividend Payment Date and the next subsequent
            Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of $1.00 per
            share on the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall
            nevertheless be payable on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend
            Payment Date.

                      (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumula-
            tive on outstanding shares of Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend Payment Date next
            preceding the date of issue of such shares of Participating
            Cumulative Preferred Stock, unless the date of issue of such
            shares is prior to the record date for the first Quarterly
            Dividend Payment Date, in which case dividends on such shares
            shall begin to accrue from the date of issue of such shares,
            or unless the date of issue is a Quarterly Dividend Payment
            Date or is a date after the record date for the determination
            of holders of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred
            Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend and before
            such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which
            events such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative
            from such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but
            unpaid dividends shall not bear interest.  Dividends paid on
            the shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock in an
            amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the
            time accrued and payable on such shares shall be allocated
            pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such shares at
            the time outstanding.  The Board of Directors may fix a
            record date for the determination of holders of shares of
            Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock entitled to receive
            payment of a dividend or distribution declared thereon, which
            record date shall be no more than 60 days prior to the date
            fixed for the payment thereof.

                      Section 3.  Voting Rights.  In addition to any
            other voting rights required by law, the holders of shares of
            Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have only the
            following voting rights:

                      (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment
            hereinafter set forth, each share of Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to 100 votes
            on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
            Company.  In the event the Company shall at any time after
            the Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on
            Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) sub-
            divide the outstanding Common Stock, or (iii) combine the
            outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
            then in each such case the number of votes per share to which

                                         -3-

            holders of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock
            were entitled immediately prior to such event shall be
            adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the
            numerator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
            outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator
            of which is the number of shares of Common Stock that were
            outstanding immediately prior to such event.

                      (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law,
            the holders of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred
            Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote
            together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of
            stockholders of the Company.

                      (C)  Whenever, at any time, dividends payable on
            the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be in
            arrears for such number of dividend periods as shall in the
            aggregate contain not less than 540 days, the holders of such
            series shall have the exclusive right, voting separately as a
            class with holders of shares of any one or more other series
            of preferred stock ranking on a parity with such series
            either as to dividends or on the distribution of assets upon
            liquidation, dissolution or winding up and upon which like
            voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to
            elect two directors of the Company at the Company's next
            annual meeting of stockholders and at each subsequent annual
            meeting of stockholders until such right is terminated as
            provided in this resolution.  At elections for such direc-
            tors, each holder of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock
            shall be entitled to one vote for each one-hundredth of a
            share held (the holders of shares of any other series of
            preferred stock ranking on such a parity being entitled to
            such number of votes, if any, for each share of stock held as
            may be applicable to them).  Upon the vesting of such voting
            right in the holders of the Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock, the maximum authorized number of members of
            the Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by
            two and the two vacancies so created shall be filled by vote
            of the holders of such series (with the holders of shares of
            any one or more other series of preferred stock ranking on
            such a parity) as hereinafter set forth.  The right of the
            holders of the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock,
            voting separately as a class with the holders of shares of
            any one or more other series of preferred stock ranking on
            such a parity, to elect members of the Board of Directors of
            the Company as aforesaid shall continue until such time as
            all dividends accumulated on such series shall have been paid
            in full, at which time such right shall terminate, except as
            by law expressly provided, subject to revesting in the event

                                         -4-

            of each and every subsequent default of the character above
            mentioned.

                      Upon any termination of the right of the holders of
            the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock as a class to
            vote for directors as herein provided, the term of office of
            all directors then in office elected by the Participating
            Cumulative Preferred Stock voting as a class shall terminate
            immediately.  If the office of any director elected by the
            holders of the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock
            voting as a class becomes vacant by reason of death, resigna-
            tion, retirement, disqualification, removal from office, or
            otherwise, the remaining director elected by the holders of
            the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock voting as a
            class may choose a successor who shall hold office for the
            unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred.
            Whenever the special voting powers vested in the holders of
            the Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock as provided in
            this resolution shall have expired, the number of directors
            shall become such number as may be provided for in the By-
            Laws, or resolution of the Board of Directors thereunder,
            irrespective of any increase made pursuant to the provisions
            of this resolution.

                      (D)  Except as set forth herein, holders of Par-
            ticipating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall have no special
            voting rights and their consent shall not be required (except
            to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of
            Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate
            action.

                      Section 4.  Certain Restrictions.

                      (A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or other
            dividends or distributions payable on the Participating
            Cumulative Preferred Stock as provided in Section 2 are in
            arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and unpaid
            dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on
            shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock outstand-
            ing shall have been paid in full, the Company shall not:

                      (i)  declare or pay dividends on, make any
                 other distributions on, or redeem or purchase or
                 otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of
                 stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or
                 upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the
                 Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock;

                                         -5-

                      (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any
                 other distributions on any shares of stock ranking
                 on a parity (either as to dividends or upon liqui-
                 dation, dissolution or winding up) with the Par-
                 ticipating Cumulative Preferred Stock, except
                 dividends paid ratably on the Participating Cumula-
                 tive Preferred Stock and all such parity stock on
                 which dividends are payable or in arrears in
                 proportion to the total amounts to which the
                 holders of all such shares are then entitled;

                      (iii)  redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire
                 for consideration shares of any stock ranking on a
                 parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation,
                 dissolution or winding up) with the Participating
                 Cumulative Preferred Stock, provided that the
                 Company may at any time redeem, purchase or other-
                 wise acquire shares of any such parity stock in
                 exchange for shares of any stock of the Company
                 ranking junior (either as to dividends or upon
                 dissolution, liquidation or winding up) to the
                 Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock; or

                      (iv)  purchase or otherwise acquire for con-
                 sideration any shares of Participating Cumulative
                 Preferred Stock, or any shares of stock ranking on
                 a parity with the Participating Cumulative
                 Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a pur-
                 chase offer made in writing or by publication (as
                 determined by the Board of Directors) to all
                 holders of such shares upon such terms as the Board
                 of Directors, after consideration of the respective
                 annual dividend rates and other relative rights and
                 preferences of the respective series and classes,
                 shall determine in good faith will result in fair
                 and equitable treatment among the respective series
                 or classes.

                      (B)  The Company shall not permit any subsidiary
            of the Company to purchase or otherwise acquire for con-
            sideration any shares of stock of the Company unless the
            Company could, under paragraph (A) of this Section 4, pur-
            chase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in
            such manner.

                      Section 5.  Reacquired Shares.  Any shares of
              Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock purchased or other-
            wise acquired by the Company in any manner whatsoever shall
            be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition

                                         -6-

            thereof.  All such shares shall upon their cancellation
            become authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock and
            may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred Stock to
            be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of
            Directors, subject to the conditions and restrictions on
            issuance set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation.

                      Section 6.  Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding
            Up.  Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
            Company, no distribution shall be made (1) to the holders
            of shares of stock ranking junior (either as to dividends or
            upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up) to the Par-
            ticipating Cumulative Preferred Stock unless, prior thereto,
            the holders of shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred
            Stock shall have received $100.00 per share, plus an amount
            equal to accrued and unpaid dividends and distributions
            thereon, whether or not declared, to the date of such pay-
            ment, provided that the holders of shares of Participating
            Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive an
            aggregate amount per share, subject to the provision for
            adjustment hereinafter set forth, equal to 100 times the
            aggregate amount to be distributed per share to holders of
            Common Stock, or (2) to the holders of stock ranking on a
            parity (either as to dividends or upon liquidation, dissolu-
            tion or winding up) with the Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock, except distributions made ratably on the
            Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock and all other such
            parity stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the
            holders of all such shares are entitled upon such liqui-
            dation, dissolution or winding up.  In the event the Company
            shall at any time after the Rights Declaration Date declare
            or pay any dividend on Common Stock payable in shares of
            Common Stock, or effect a subdivision or combination or
            consolidation of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (by
            reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend
            in shares of Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of
            shares of Common Stock, then in each such case the aggregate
            amount to which holders of shares of Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior to such event
            under the proviso in clause (1) of the preceding sentence
            shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction
            the numerator of which is the number of shares of Common
            Stock outstanding immediately after such event and the
            denominator of which is the number of shares of Common Stock
            that were outstanding immediately prior to such event.

                      Section 7.  Consolidation, Merger, etc.  In case
            the Company shall enter into any consolidation, merger,
            combination or other transaction in which the shares of

                                         -7-

            Common Stock are exchanged for or changed into other stock or
            securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such
            case the shares of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock
            shall at the same time be similarly exchanged or changed in
            an amount per share (subject to the provision for adjustment
            hereinafter set forth) equal to 100 times the aggregate
            amount of stock, securities, cash and/or any other property
            (payable in kind), as the case may be, into which or for
            which each share of Common Stock is changed or exchanged.  In
            the event the Company shall at any time after the Rights
            Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on Common Stock
            payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the out-
            standing Common Stock, or (iii) combine the outstanding
            Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each
            such case the amount set forth in the preceding sentence with
            respect to the exchange or change of shares of Participating
            Cumulative Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying
            such amount by a fraction the numerator of which is the
            number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
            after such event and the denominator of which is the number
            of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
            prior to such event.

                      Section 8.  No Redemption.  The shares of Par-
            ticipating Cumulative Preferred Stock shall not be
            redeemable.

                      Section 9.  Rank.  The Participating Cumulative
            Preferred Stock shall rank junior with respect to payment of
            dividends and on liquidation to all other series of the
            Company's preferred stock outstanding on the date hereof and
            to all such other series that may be issued after the date
            hereof except to the extent that any such other series
            specifically provides that it shall rank junior to the Par-
            ticipating Cumulative Preferred Stock.

                      Section 10.  Amendment.  The Certificate of Incor-
            poration of the Company and these resolutions shall not be
            amended in any manner which would materially alter or change
            the powers, preferences or special rights of the Participat-

                            SUMMARY OF RIGHTS TO PURCHASE
                                   PREFERRED STOCK

                      On June 17, 1988, the Board of Directors of Texas
            Instruments Incorporated (the "Company") declared a dividend
            distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of
            Common Stock of the Company to stockholders of record at the
            close of business on June 30, 1988.  When exercisable, each
            Right entitles the registered holder to purchase from the
            Company a unit consisting of one one-hundredth of a share (a
            "Unit") of Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock, par
            value $25 per share (the "Preferred Stock") at a cash pur-
            chase price of $200 per Unit (the "Purchase Price"), subject
            to adjustment.  The description and terms of the Rights are
            set forth in a Rights Agreement between the Company and
            Morgan Shareholder Services Trust Company, as Rights Agent.

                      Initially, the Rights will be attached to all
            outstanding shares of Common Stock, and no separate Right
            Certificates will be distributed.  The Rights will separate
            from the Common Stock and a Distribution Date will occur upon
            the earlier of: (i) 10 days following a public announcement
            that a person or group of affiliated or associated persons
            (an "Acquiring Person") has acquired beneficial ownership of
            20% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (the
            "Stock Acquisition Date"), or (ii) 10 business days following
            the commencement of a tender offer or exchange offer that
            would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring
            Person.  Until the Distribution Date (or earlier redemption
            or expiration of the Rights), (i) the Rights will be evi-
            denced by the Common Stock certificates and will be trans-
            ferred with and only with such Common Stock certificates,
            (ii) new Common Stock certificates issued after June 30, 1988
            will contain a notation incorporating the Rights Agreement by
            reference, and (iii) the surrender for transfer of any cer-
            tificates for Common Stock will also constitute the transfer
            of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by
            such certificate.

                      The Rights are not exercisable until the Distribu-
            tion Date and will expire at the close of business on June
            17, 1998, unless previously redeemed by the Company as
            described below.

                      As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date,
            Right Certificates will be mailed to holders of record of
            Common Stock as of the close of business on the Distribution

            Date and, thereafter, the separate Right Certificates alone
            will represent the Rights.  Except as otherwise determined by
            the Board of Directors, with certain exceptions, only shares
            of Common Stock issued prior to the Distribution Date will be
            issued with Rights.

                      In the event that any Person shall become an
            Acquiring Person, proper provision will be made so that each
            holder of a Right, other than Rights that are, or (under
            certain circumstances specified in the Rights Agreement)
            were, beneficially owned by an Acquiring Person (which will
            thereafter be void), will thereafter have the right to
            receive upon exercise that number of shares of Common Stock
            having a market value of two times the Purchase Price of the
            Right.  In the event that, at any time following the Stock
            Acquisition Date, (i) the Company is acquired in a merger or
            other business combination transaction or (ii) 50% or more of
            the Company's assets or earning power is sold, each holder of
            a Right shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon
            exercise, common stock of the acquiring company having a
            value equal to two times the Purchase Price of the Right.
            The events described in this paragraph are referred to as the
            "Triggering Events."

                      The Purchase Price payable, and the number of Units
            of Preferred Stock or other securities or property issuable,
            upon exercise of the Rights are subject to adjustment from
            time to time to prevent dilution (i) in the event of a stock
            dividend on, or a subdivision, combination or reclassifica-
            tion of, the Preferred Stock, (ii) if holders of the
            Preferred Stock are granted certain rights or warrants to
            subscribe for Preferred Stock or convertible securities at
            less than the current market price of the Preferred Stock, or
            (iii) upon the distribution to holders of the Preferred Stock
            of evidences of indebtedness or assets (excluding regular
            quarterly cash dividends) or of subscription rights or war-
            rants (other than those referred to above).

                      With certain exceptions, no adjustment in the
            Purchase Price will be required until cumulative adjustments
            amount to at least 1% of the Purchase Price.  No fractional
            Units will be issued and, in lieu thereof, an adjustment in
            cash will be made based on the market price of the Preferred
            Stock on the last trading date prior to the date of exercise.

                      The Rights may be redeemed in whole, but not in
            part, at a price of $.01 per Right by the Board of Directors
            at any time until the tenth day after the Stock Acquisition
            Date (or such later date as a majority of the Continuing

                                         -2-

            Directors (as defined in the Rights Agreement) then in office
            may determine).  Immediately upon the action of the Board of
            Directors ordering redemption of the Rights, the Rights will
            terminate and thereafter the only right of the holders of
            Rights will be to receive the redemption price.

                      Until a Right is exercised, the holder will have no
            rights as a stockholder of the Company (beyond those as an
            existing stockholder), including the right to vote or to
            receive dividends.  While the distribution of the Rights will
            not be taxable to stockholders or to the Company, stock-
            holders may, depending upon the circumstances, recognize
            taxable income in the event that the Rights become exer-
            cisable for Common Stock (or other consideration) of the
            Company or for common stock of an acquiring company as set
            forth above.

                      A copy of the Rights Agreement has been filed with
            the Securities and Exchange Commission as an Exhibit to a
            Registration Statement on Form 8-A.  A copy of the Rights
            Agreement is available free of charge from the Company.  This
            summary description of the Rights does not purport to be
            complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
            Rights Agreement.

                                                              Exhibit 10(a)(i)

                 TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ANNUAL INCENTIVE  PLAN
                        As Amended  April 15, 1993 

The Texas Instruments Annual Incentive Plan is designed to provide an
additional incentive for those employees who are key to the Company's success
in the highly technological and competitive industries in which it operates. 
The Plan provides for rewarding certain employees by awards for outstanding
ability and exceptional service based upon the individual's contribution to
the Company. 
  
For purposes of the Plan unless otherwise indicated, the term "Company" shall
mean Texas Instruments Incorporated and its subsidiaries of which sub-
stantially all of the  voting stock is owned directly or indirectly by Texas
Instruments. 

Eligibility

The employees of the Company eligible to receive awards under the Plan shall
consist of the group of employees (including officers and directors) in
management or other key positions specified for each year  by the Committee
described below and such other employees as said Committee may designate for
such year. If an employee takes an approved leave of absence or dies prior to
a determination of awards to be made under the Plan for a year in which the
employee was eligible to receive awards under the Plan, such employee on leave
or the estate of such deceased employee shall be eligible to receive awards
under the Plan for such year.  Directors who are not full-time or part-time
officers or employees are not eligible to participate in the Plan.  

Administration of Plan 

The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors which
shall be known as the Compensation Committee (the Committee) which shall be
appointed by a majority of the whole Board and shall consist of not less than
three directors.  The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate
members of the Committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at
any meeting of the Committee.  A director may serve as a member or alternate
member of the Committee only during periods in which he is a "disinterested
person" as described in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as in effect from time to time.  No member or alternate member of the
Committee shall be eligible, while a member or alternate member, for
participation in the Plan.  The Committee shall have full power and authority
to construe, interpret and administer the Plan.  It may issue rules and
regulations for administration of the Plan.  It shall meet at such times and
places as it may determine.  A majority of the members of the Committee shall
constitute a quorum and all decisions of the Committee shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon all parties, including the Company, the
stockholders and the employees. 

The Committee shall have the full and exclusive right to make awards  under
the Plan except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan.  In determining
the selection of recipients and the amount or form of any  award, the
Committee shall take into consideration the contribution of the recipients
during the fiscal year to the Company's success and such other factors as the
Committee shall determine.  The Committee shall have the authority to consult
with and receive recommendations from officers or other executives of the
Company with regard to these matters.  

The Committee may delegate such power, authority and rights with respect to
the administration of the Plan as it deems appropriate to one or more members
of the management of the Company (including, without limitation, a committee
of one or more members of management appointed by the Committee); provided,
however, that the Committee shall have the exclusive right to make awards  to
employees who are directors or officers of the Company, and that any
delegation to management shall conform with the requirements of the General
Corporation Law of Delaware, as in effect from time to time.  

                                     1

Expenses of Administration 

The expenses of the administration of this Plan, including the dividend
equivalents and interest provided in the Plan, shall be borne by the Company 
and none of them shall be charged against the Incentive  Reserve described
below. 

Amendments 

The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time and from time to time,
alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any part thereof as it may deem
proper and in the best interests of the Company, provided, however, that no
such action shall affect or impair the rights under any  award  theretofore
granted under the Plan, except that in the case of an employee employed
outside the United States (or his beneficiary) the Board may vary the
provisions of the Plan as it may deem appropriate to conform with local laws,
practices and procedures.  Further, unless the stockholders of the Company
shall have first approved thereof, no amendment shall be made which shall
increase the maximum amount which may be credited to the Incentive  Reserve
described below in any year.
 
Awards

Awards may be made from time to time during each year under the Plan by the
Committee or its delegate(s) in amounts which do not exceed the amount then
available in the Incentive Reserve described below.  Such awards may be
denominated in cash, in shares of the Company's common stock, or both, and may
be payable in cash or shares, or both, as the Committee may determine.

Scope of the Plan

The Committee shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to determine what
payments to eligible employees shall be deemed to be incentive compensation
for the purposes of this Plan.  Awards under the Company's  Patent Incentive
Award program shall be deemed not to have been made under this Plan and
payments under  the Patent Incentive Award program shall not be charged to the
Incentive Reserve described below.  Payments under any incentive plans which
operational organizations of the Company may have from time to time to any
employees who are then eligible to receive awards under this Plan shall be
charged to the Incentive Reserve described below.  Special payments to
employees involved in unusual transactions (including, without limitation, a
sale of a portion of the business of the Company) shall not be charged to the
Incentive Reserve described below unless otherwise determined by the
Committee.  Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as preventing the Company
from having from time to time incentive or other variable compensation plans
applicable to employees who are not then eligible to participate in this Plan,
and payments of incentive or other variable compensation under such plans to
such employees shall not be charged to the Incentive Reserve described below.

Incentive Reserve

For the calendar year 1965 and each of the calendar years thereafter, the
Board of Directors shall cause to be credited to an Incentive  Reserve
(hereinafter called the Reserve) an amount determined as follows: 

     10% of the amount by which the Company's net income for such year
     exceeds 6% of net capital but not in excess of the amount paid out as
     dividends on the common stock of the Company during such year, except
     that the Board may in its discretion direct that a lesser amount be
     credited.

As used in this Plan

     1.    Net income  shall mean the amount reported as net income in the
     annual statement of income for the year as shown by the annual report to
     stockholders  plus interest on long-term debt and amounts credited to
     the Reserve for such year.

                                     2

     2.    Net capital   shall mean the total of stockholders' equity plus
     long-term debt (less current portion) as shown on the balance sheet as
     of the end of the year preceding the year for which net income, as
     above, is determined plus treasury stock held for the purposes of this
     Plan.

As soon as practicable after the end of each year, the Company's independent
auditors  shall determine and report to the Board of Directors the maximum
amount creditable to the Reserve for that year under the provisions of this
Plan.  After receipt of such auditors' report, the Board shall determine the
amount to be credited to the Reserve for such year and the amount so
determined shall be credited to the Reserve as of the close of the year.  The
Committee shall promptly be advised of the amount so credited to the Reserve
and of the total amount available in the Reserve (after deducting any unpaid
installments of incentive awards previously granted).  

The Committee shall make a determination of  awards to be made under the Plan
for each  year at such time or times as the Committee shall deem appropriate. 
The aggregate of such  awards may be less than, but shall not exceed, the
total amount available in the Reserve, except that, after the end of a year
and prior to the Board's determination of an amount to be credited to the
Reserve for that year, the Committee may make awards in excess of the amount
available in the Reserve if such awards are made payable only if an amount
adequate to cover such awards is first credited to the Reserve for such year. 

If the aggregate of the  awards determined by the Committee to be made under
the Plan for a given year shall at any time be less than the total amount
available in the Reserve, the Committee may at any time or times determine
that additional awards be made under the Plan for such year, provided that the
aggregate of all  awards for such year  shall not exceed the total amount
available in the Reserve, and that all  awards for such year shall be
determined on or before December 31 of the following year. 

If (i) the amount determined and reported by the Company's independent
auditors as the maximum amount creditable to the Reserve for any year shall
for any reason later prove to have been overstated and (ii) the amount
credited to the Reserve at the close of such year was in excess of the revised
maximum amount creditable to the Reserve for that year, then the amount
available at that time or subsequently in the Reserve shall be reduced by the
amount of such excess.  Thus excess credits to the Reserve resulting from such
overstatement shall be corrected exclusively by adjustment of the Reserve then
or subsequently available and not by recourse to any person.  

Any balance remaining in the Reserve after making  awards for any year  shall
continue in the Reserve and be available for  awards for future years  except
to the extent otherwise directed by the Committee.   Any payments that are
made by the Company, and any incentive awards that are granted by, or become
obligations of, the Company, through the assumption by the Company of, or in
substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired company
shall not, except in the case of payments made to or incentive awards granted
to employees who are officers or directors of the Company for purposes of
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, be charged to
the Reserve.

Payment of  Awards 

Incentive awards may be made in cash or in Texas Instruments common stock, or
partly in cash and partly in stock as the Committee in its discretion may
determine.  Incentive awards made wholly or partly in stock, or any
installments thereof, may be paid wholly or partly in cash as the Committee in
its discretion may determine.  

The Company shall make available as and when required a sufficient number of
shares of its common stock for the purpose of this Plan.  Such common stock
shall be either authorized and unissued shares or treasury stock. 

Authorized and unissued shares and treasury stock shall be valued for the
purpose of  awards and charged to the Reserve at the simple average of the
high and the low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite
Tape on the date the  awards are made by the Committee (or if there shall be
no trading on that date, then on the first previous date on which there is
such trading).  Authorized and unissued shares and treasury stock shall be
valued for the purpose of payments in cash of  awards made in stock, at the
simple average of the high and the low prices of Texas Instruments common
stock on the Composite Tape on the

                                     3

payment date (or if there shall be no trading on that date, then on the first
previous date on which there is such trading).  

The Committee may direct the  awards to the participants or any of them for
any year to be paid in a single amount or in installments of equal or varying
amounts and may prescribe such terms and conditions concerning payment of such
installments as it deems appropriate, including completion of specific periods
of employment with the Company or achievement of specific goals established by
the Committee, as it deems appropriate, provided that such terms and
conditions are not more favorable to a participant than those expressly set
forth in this Plan.  The Committee may determine that dividend equivalents or
interest, as applicable, will be payable with respect to any installments of
any award.  The Committee may at any time after an incentive award is made
amend any such direction and may amend or delete any such terms and conditions
concerning payment of installments, if the Committee deems it appropriate.  

When the obligation to pay an installment or installments of an  award  has
terminated for any  reason, the amounts relating to such installment or
installments shall  be added back to  the Reserve and shall be available for
use under this Plan.  

Appropriate adjustments in incentive awards payable in Texas Instruments
common stock shall be made to give effect to any mergers, consolidations,
acquisitions, stock splits, or other relevant changes in capitalization
occurring after the effective date of this Plan; however, no fractional shares
shall be distributed. 

Payments of awards to employees of subsidiaries of the Company shall be paid
directly by such subsidiaries.  

Withholding

Whenever a participant is obligated to pay to the Company an amount required
to be withheld under applicable income tax laws in connection with the payment
of stock pursuant to an  award under this Plan,  such payment may be made (a)
in cash, or (b) to the extent from time to time approved by the Committee, (i)
in Texas Instruments common stock or (ii) partly in cash and partly in Texas
Instruments common stock.  For purposes of any payment in Texas Instruments
common stock, such stock shall be valued at the simple average of the high and
low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite Tape on the date
that the payment in stock becomes taxable (or if there is no trading on that
date, then on the first previous date on which there is such trading).

          1988 Stock Option Plans, or to which such an Award relates, are
          forfeited, or if an Award or such an option otherwise terminates
          without the delivery of Shares or of other consideration, then the
          Shares covered by such Award or option, or to which such Award
          relates, or the number of Shares otherwise counted against the
          aggregate number of Shares available under the Plan with respect
          to such Award, to the extent of any such forfeiture or
          termination, shall again be, or shall become, available for
          granting Awards under the Plan to the extent permitted by Rule
          16b-3. 

     (ii) Additional Restriction.  The maximum number of Shares that may be
          awarded under paragraph (b), "Restricted Stock and Restricted
          Stock Units," and paragraph (d), "Other Stock-Based Awards," under
          the heading "Awards" below during the term of the Plan shall be
          1,000,000  shares.

(b)  Accounting for Awards  

     For purposes of this section:

     (i)  If an Award is denominated in Shares, the number of Shares covered
          by such Award, or to which such Award relates, shall be counted on
          the date of grant of such Award against the aggregate number of
          Shares available for granting Awards under the Plan; and

     (ii) Awards not denominated in Shares  shall be counted against the
          aggregate number of Shares available for granting Awards under the
          Plan in such amount and at such time as the Committee shall
          determine under procedures adopted by the Committee consistent
          with the purposes of the Plan;
          
provided, however, that Awards that operate in tandem with (whether granted
simultaneously with or at a different time from) other Awards may be counted
or not counted under procedures adopted by the Committee in order to avoid
double counting.  Any Shares that are delivered by the Company, and any Awards
that are granted by, or become obligations of, the Company, through the
assumption by the Company of, or in substitution for, outstanding awards
previously granted by an acquired company shall not, except in the case of
Awards granted to employees who are officers or directors of the Company for
purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, be
counted against the Shares available for granting Awards under the Plan.

(c)  Sources of Shares Deliverable Under Awards

Any Shares delivered pursuant to an Award may consist, in whole or in part, of
authorized and unissued Shares or of treasury Shares.

(d)  Adjustments  

In the event that the Committee shall determine that any dividend or other
distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other
property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, 

                                     3

reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination,
repurchase or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, issuance
of warrants or other rights to purchase Shares or other securities of the
Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Shares
such that an adjustment is determined by the Committee to be appropriate in
order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits
intended to be made available under the Plan, then the Committee shall, in
such manner as it may deem equitable, adjust any or all of (i) the number and
type of Shares (or other securities or property) which thereafter may be made
the subject of Awards, (ii) the number and type of Shares (or other securities
or property) subject to outstanding Awards, and (iii) the grant, purchase, or
exercise price with respect to any Award or, if deemed appropriate, make
provision for a cash payment to the holder of an outstanding Award; provided,
however, in each case, that with respect to Awards of Incentive Stock Options
no such adjustment shall be authorized to the extent that such authority would
cause the Plan to violate Section 422(b)(1) of the Code or any successor
provision thereof; and provided further,  that the number of Shares subject to
any Award denominated in Shares shall always be a whole number.

Awards

(a)  Options  

The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Options to Participants with the
following terms and conditions and with such additional terms and conditions,
in either case not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan, as the
Committee shall determine:

     (i)  Exercise Price.  The purchase price per Share purchasable under an
          Option shall be determined by the Committee; provided, however,
          that, except in the case of Options granted through assumption of,
          or in substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by
          an acquired company, such purchase price shall not be less than
          the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant of such
          Option.

     (ii) Option Term.  The term of each Option shall be fixed by the
          Committee.

    (iii) Time and Method of Exercise.  The Committee shall determine the
          time or times at which an Option may be exercised in whole or in
          part, and the method or methods by which, and the form or forms,
          including, without limitation, cash, Shares, other Awards, or
          other property, or any combination thereof, having a Fair Market
          Value on the exercise date equal to the relevant exercise price,
          in which, payment of the exercise price with respect thereto may
          be made or deemed to have been made.

    (iv)  Incentive Stock Options.  The terms of any Incentive Stock Option
          granted under the Plan shall comply in all respects with the
          provisions of Section 422 of the Code, or any successor provision
          thereto, and any regulations promulgated thereunder.

(b) Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

     (i)  Issuance.  The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Awards of
          Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units to Participants.

     (ii) Restrictions.  Shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock
          Units shall be subject to such restrictions as the Committee may
          impose (including, without limitation, any limitation on the right
          to vote a Share of Restricted Stock or the right to receive any
          dividend or other right or property), which restrictions may lapse
          separately or in combination at such time or times, in such
          installments or otherwise, as the Committee may deem appropriate.

    (iii) Registration.  Any Restricted Stock granted under the Plan may be
          evidenced in such manner as the Committee may deem appropriate
          including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance
          of a stock certificate or certificates.  In the event any stock
          certificate is issued in respect of Shares of Restricted Stock
          granted under the Plan, such certificate shall be registered in
          the name of the

                                     4

          Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the
          terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Restricted
          Stock.

    (iv)  Forfeiture.  Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon
          termination of employment (as determined under criteria
          established by the Committee) for any reason during the applicable
          restriction period, all Shares of Restricted Stock and all
          Restricted Stock Units still, in either case, subject to
          restriction shall be forfeited and reacquired by the Company;
          provided, however, that the Committee may, when it finds that a
          waiver would be in the best interests of the Company, waive in
          whole or in part any or all remaining restrictions with respect to
          Shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units. 
          Unrestricted Shares, evidenced in such manner as the Committee
          shall deem appropriate, shall be delivered to the holder of
          Restricted Stock promptly after such Restricted Stock shall become
          Released Securities.

(c) Performance Units

The Committee is hereby authorized to grant Performance Units  to
Participants.  Subject to the terms of the Plan,  a Performance Unit  granted
under the Plan (i) may be denominated or payable in cash, Shares (including,
without limitation, Restricted Stock), other securities, other Awards, or
other property and (ii) shall confer on the holder thereof rights valued as
determined by the Committee and payable to, or exercisable by, the holder of
the Performance Unit, in whole or in part, upon the achievement of such
performance goals during such performance periods as the Committee shall
establish.  Subject to the terms of the Plan,  the performance goals to be
achieved during any performance period, the length of any performance period,
the amount of any Performance Unit  granted and the amount of any payment or
transfer to be made pursuant to any Performance Unit  shall be determined by
the Committee.

(d) Other Stock-Based Awards

The Committee is hereby authorized to grant to Participants such other Awards
(including, without limitation, stock appreciation rights) that are
denominated or payable in, valued in whole or in part by reference to, or
otherwise based on or related to, Shares (including, without limitation,
securities convertible into Shares) as are deemed by the Committee to be
consistent with the purposes of the Plan.   Subject to the terms of the Plan, 
the Committee shall determine the terms and conditions of such Awards.  Shares
or other securities delivered pursuant to a purchase right granted under this
paragraph (d) shall be purchased for such consideration, which may be paid by
such method or methods and in such form or forms, including, without
limitation, cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property,
or any combination thereof, as the Committee shall determine, the value of
which consideration, as established by the Committee, shall, except in the
case of Awards granted through assumption of, or in substitution for,
outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired company,  not be less
than the Fair Market Value of such Shares or other securities as of the date
such purchase right is granted. 

(e)  General

     (i)  No Cash Consideration for Awards.  Awards shall be granted for no
          cash consideration or for such minimal cash consideration as may
          be required by applicable law.

     (ii) Awards May Be Granted Separately or Together.  Awards may, in the
          discretion of the Committee, be granted either alone or in
          addition to or in tandem with any other Award or any award granted
          under any other plan of the Company.  Awards granted in addition
          to or in tandem with other Awards, or in addition to or in tandem
          with awards granted under any other plan of the Company, may be
          granted either at the same time as or at a different time from the
          grant of such other Awards or awards.

    (iii) Forms of Payment Under Awards.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, 
          payments or transfers to be made by the Company upon the grant,
          exercise or payment of an Award may be made in such form or forms
          as the Committee shall determine including, without limitation,
          cash, Shares, other securities,

                                     5

          other Awards, or other property, or any combination thereof, and
          may be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments, or
          on a deferred basis, in each case in accordance with rules and
          procedures established by the Committee.  Such rules and
          procedures may include, without limitation, provisions for the
          payment or crediting of reasonable interest on installment or
          deferred payments or the grant or crediting of dividend
          equivalents in respect of installment or deferred payments.

     (iv) Limits on Transfer of Awards.  No Award (other than Released
          Securities), and no right under any such Award, shall be
          assignable, alienable, saleable or transferable by a Participant
          otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution
          (or, in the case of an Award of Restricted Securities, to the
          Company); provided, however, that, if so determined by the
          Committee, a Participant may, in the manner established by the
          Committee, designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries to exercise
          the rights of the Participant, and to receive any property
          distributable, with respect to any Award upon the death of the
          Participant.  Each Award, and each right under any Award, shall be
          exercisable during the Participant's lifetime only by the
          Participant or, if permissible under applicable law, by the
          Participant's guardian or legal representative.  No Award (other
          than Released Securities), and no right under any such Award, may
          be pledged, alienated, attached, or otherwise encumbered, and any
          purported pledge, alienation, attachment or encumbrance thereof
          shall be void and unenforceable against the Company.

     (v)  Term of Awards.  The term of each Award shall be for such period
          as may be determined by the Committee; provided, however, that in
          no event shall the term of any Incentive Stock Option exceed a
          period of ten years from the date of its grant.

   (vi)   Share Certificates.  All certificates for Shares or other
          securities delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award or the
          exercise thereof shall be subject to such stop transfer orders and
          other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the
          Plan or the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the
          Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which
          such Shares or other securities are then listed, and any
          applicable Federal or state securities laws, and the Committee may
          cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to
          make appropriate reference to such restrictions.

Amendment and Termination

Except to the extent prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise
expressly provided in an Award Agreement or in the Plan:

a)   Amendments to the Plan

The Board of Directors of the Company may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue
or terminate the Plan,  without the consent of any share owner, Participant,
other holder or beneficiary of an Award, or other person; provided, however,
that, no such action shall impair the rights under any Award theretofore
granted under the Plan and that, notwithstanding any other provision of the
Plan or any Award Agreement, without the approval of the stockholders of the
Company no such amendment, alteration, suspension, discontinuation or
termination shall be made that would:

     (i)  increase the total number of Shares available for Awards under the
          Plan, except as provided under the heading "Shares Available for
          Awards" above; or

     (ii) permit Options or other Stock-Based Awards encompassing rights to
          purchase Shares to be granted with per Share grant, purchase, or
          exercise prices of less than the Fair Market Value of a Share on
          the date of grant thereof, except to the extent permitted in
          paragraphs (a) or (d) under the heading "Awards" above.

                                     6

(b)  Amendments to Awards

The Committee may waive any conditions or rights under, amend any terms of, or
amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate, any Award theretofore
granted, prospectively or retroactively, without the consent of any relevant
Participant or holder or beneficiary of an Award, provided that no such action
shall impair the rights of any relevant Participant or holder or beneficiary
under any Award theretofore granted under the Plan; and provided further that,
except as provided for in paragraph (d) under the heading "Shares Available
for Awards" above and in paragraph (c) below, no such action shall reduce the
exercise price of any Option.

(c)  Adjustments of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or
Nonrecurring Events

The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in the terms and
conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual
or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, the events described in
paragraph (d) under the heading "Shares Available for Awards" above) affecting
the Company, or the financial statements of the Company, or of changes in
applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, whenever the Committee
determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution
or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made
available under the Plan.

(d)  Correction of Defects, Omissions and Inconsistences

The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any
inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it
shall deem desirable to carry the Plan into effect.

General Provisions

(a)  No Rights to Awards

No employee, Participant or other person shall have any claim to be granted
any Award under the Plan, and there is no obligation for uniformity of
treatment of employees, Participants, or holders or beneficiaries of Awards
under the Plan.  The terms and conditions of Awards need not be the same with
respect to each recipient.

(b)  Delegation

The Committee may delegate to one or more officers or managers of the Company,
or a committee of such officers or managers, the authority, subject to such
terms and limitations as the Committee shall determine, to grant Awards to, or
to cancel, modify, waive rights with respect to, alter, discontinue, suspend
or terminate Awards held by, employees who are not officers or directors of
the Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended; provided, that any delegation to management shall conform with the
requirements of the General Corporation Law of Delaware, as in effect from
time to time.

(c)  Withholding

The Company shall be authorized to withhold from any Award granted or any
payment due or transfer made under any Award or under the Plan the amount (in
cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards, or other property) of
withholding taxes due in respect of an Award, its exercise, or any payment or
transfer under such Award or under the Plan and to take such other action
(including, without limitation, providing for elective payment of such amounts
in cash, Shares, other securities, other Awards or other property by the
Participant) as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all
obligations for the payment of such taxes.

                                     7

(d)  No Limit on Other Compensation Arrangements

Nothing contained in the Plan shall prevent the Company from adopting or
continuing in effect other or additional compensation arrangements, and such
arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific
cases.

(e)  No Right to Employment

The grant of an Award shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right
to be retained in the employ of the Company.  Further, the Company may at any
time dismiss a Participant from employment, free from any liability, or any
claim under the Plan, unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in
any Award Agreement.

(f)  Governing Law

The validity, construction, and effect of the Plan and any rules and
regulations relating to the Plan shall be determined in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware and applicable Federal law.

(g)  Severability

If any provision of the Plan or any Award is or becomes or is deemed to be
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or as to any person or
Award, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed
applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed
amended to conform to applicable laws, or if it cannot be so construed or
deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially
altering the intent of the Plan or the Award, such provision shall be stricken
as to such jurisdiction, person or Award, and the remainder of the Plan and
any such Award shall remain in full force and effect.

(h)  No Trust or Fund Created

Neither the Plan nor any Award shall create or be construed to create a trust
or separate fund of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company
and a Participant or any other person.  To the extent that any person acquires
a right to receive payments from the Company pursuant to an Award, such right
shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the
Company.

(i)  No Fractional Shares

No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any
Award, and the Committee shall determine whether cash, other securities or
other property shall be paid or transferred in lieu of any fractional Shares,
or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be canceled,
terminated or otherwise eliminated.

Effective Date of the Plan

The Plan shall be effective as of the date of its approval by the stockholders
of the Company.

Term of the Plan

No Award shall be granted under the Plan after April 14, 2003.  However,
unless otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or in an applicable Award
Agreement, any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond such date, and the
authority of the Committee to amend, alter, adjust, suspend, discontinue, or
terminate any such Award, or to waive any conditions or rights under any such
Award, and the authority of the Board of Directors of the Company to amend the
Plan, shall extend beyond such date.

     Texas Instruments Incorporated, a Delaware corporation with its
principal office in Dallas, Texas hereinafter sometimes referred to as "TI",
for the purpose of amending the TI Directors Retirement Benefit Plan dated
January 1, 1987 and heretofore amended (the "Plan") does hereby agree that the
Plan is amended in the following respects:

     1.   Section 2-2 of the Plan is hereby amended so as to read as
          follows:

          "Section 2-2.  Amount of Retirement Benefits.  The retirement
          benefits payable to Participants under this Plan shall be in the

          the greater of (a) the life of the Participant, or (b) the number
          of years equal to the combined number of full years the
          Participant served as a Director and as a General Director of TI. 
          For purposes of this Section, the term "year" shall mean a twelve

          as a Director or General Director, as applicable, and each
          anniversary of such month."

     3.   A new Section 2-6, reading as follows, is hereby added to the Plan
          immediately following Section 2-5 thereof:

          "Section 2-6.  Optional Form of Payment.  Notwithstanding the
          provisions of Section 2-4 and Section 2-5 of this Plan, in the
          event a Participant who is entitled to receive retirement benefits
          hereunder shall elect at the time and in the manner described
          below, all of the retirement benefits payable to such Participant
          hereunder shall be paid in the form of a single lump sum payment
          equal to the then actuarial present value of such retirement
          benefits.  The actuarial present value of the retirement benefits
          which a Participant is entitled to receive under this Plan shall
          be determined for purposes of this Section by use of the actuarial
          assumptions for optional forms of retirement benefit being
          utilized by the TI Employees Pension Plan for determination of
          lump sum distributions at the time when such determination is
          made.  The election for a single lump sum payment shall be made in
          the manner specified by TI and shall be made prior to the date on
          which the Participant retires from the Board of Directors of TI,
          dies or becomes totally disabled, except that Directors who
          retired prior to February 18, 1994 and who as of such date are
          receiving benefits under this Plan shall make such election with
          respect to the remaining benefits to which such retired Directors
          are entitled on or before May 31, 1994".

     This Amendment shall be effective as of February 18, 1994.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, this instrument is executed as of the effective
date.

                            STATEMENT OF POLICY
                          THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

                      TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED

             TOP OFFICER AND BOARD MEMBER RETIREMENT PRACTICES

The need for an orderly succession of top TI officers is expressed in the
Statement of Policy entitled "Assurance of Organizational Health." As a
stimulus to the desired succession, this Statement of Policy provides for
optional early retirement of some officers and mandatory retirement of all
officers and Board members in accordance with government age discrimination
regulations. 

A.   POLICY 

     1.   Retirement of all TI officers for whom it is permitted by the Age
          Discrimination in Employment Act is mandatory at age 65. 

     2.   A Board member will not be eligible to stand for reelection to the
          Board after attaining age 70. 

     3.   The Board of Directors may make available to certain top officers
          the option to retire at or any time after attaining age 58.  This
          option is separate from and in addition to the early retirement
          provisions in the TI Employees Pension Plan applicable to all
          personnel.  Those eligible will include the Chairman of the Board,
          the President, and other personnel specified by the Board. In
          determining such eligibility, the Board will ordinarily review all
          employees in job grades specified by the Board.  However, a few
          individuals not in such job grades may also be offered the early
          retirement option.  The Board may specify minimum lengths of
          service as a condition of eligibility.  Officers other than the
          Chairman and the President will be advised of their forthcoming
          eligibility at any time after the Board has acted to make the
          option available to them (usually after attaining age 53). 
          Individuals other than the Chairman and the President to whom the
          option may be offered will be recommended to the Board by the
          Compensation Committee upon the suggestion from the Chairman and
          President. 

          Anyone electing optional early retirement will enter into  an
          Early Retirement Agreement, which includes a non-compete clause,
          and will receive Supplemental Early Retirement Compensation,
          determined in accordance with Appendix A made a part of this
          statement of policy.

                           -Retirement...Page 1-

     a.   Advising Officers of Early Retirement Options. It will be the
          responsibility of the Chairman to ensure that any individual
          receiving an early retirement option from the Board is so advised
          by the officer to whom the individual is responsible in written
          form acceptable to the Secretary of the Company.

     b.   Compensation and Benefits for a Top Officer Exercising Early
          Retirement.  In addition to the benefits to which a retiree is
          entitled under current and future TI benefit programs, an officer
          who exercises his or her option to retire early, at age 58 or some
          older age, will receive compensation under an Early Retirement
          Agreement which provides for supplemental early retirement
          payments determined in accordance with Appendix A attached hereto.
          
     c.   Early Retirement Agreement. An agreement which includes a non-
          compete clause will be entered into with each top officer when he
          or she elects early retirement.  Such agreement will be
          substantially in the form provided in Appendix B attached hereto,
          with such changes as may be approved by the Chief Executive
          Officer and counsel for TI.  Determinations of whether an activity
          is or is reasonably expected to be competitive with TI and whether
          there would be significant harm to TI from such competition shall
          be made by the Chief Executive Officer of TI or his designee after
          consulting with counsel for the Company.  It will be  the
          responsibility of the Secretary of the Company to make periodic
          appropriate inquiries and advise the Board that the non-compete
          clause is not violated. 

     d.   Initiation of Optional Early Retirement. An individual who elects
          optional early retirement will be responsible for advising in
          written form, acceptable to the Secretary of the Company, the
          officer to whom he or she reports of his or her intended date of
          early retirement.  Such advice should precede the date of
          retirement to accomplish sufficiently an orderly succession.

                            STATEMENT OF POLICY
                          THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

                      TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED

                                APPENDIX A
             TOP OFFICER AND BOARD MEMBER RETIREMENT PRACTICES


                  SUPPLEMENTAL EARLY RETIREMENT PAYMENTS


Those employees who are designated by the Board for entitlement to
supplemental early retirement payments are entitled to the following upon
retirement in accordance with the Top Officer and  Board Member Retirement
Practices statement of policy:  

     1.   Retirement income from TI Employees Pension Trust calculated in
          full compliance with the provisions of the TI Employees Pension
          Plan in effect at the time of retirement. 

     2.   Retiree medical insurance for the retirees and their eligible
          dependents as described in the TI Retiree Medical Insurance
          Certificate in effect at the time of retirement. 

     3.   Benefits under any other programs to which they may become
          entitled in the future as retirees. 

     4.   Supplemental early retirement payments as described below. 

Determination of Supplemental Early Retirement Payments  

     Calculation of this payment results from the following: 

          Normal retirement annual benefit at age 65, as defined below

                                   times

          Reduction percentage appropriate to attained age at early
          retirement from reduction percentage table below

                                   minus

          Early retirement annual benefit from the TI Employees Pension
          Trust, as defined below

                                  equals

          Annual supplemental early retirement payment for life.

Normal retirement annual benefit at age 65 is the benefit which would have
been payable to an individual retiring at age 65 and electing the option of
annual payment for life from the TI Employees Pension Trust, assuming the top
officer would have continued to work to age 65 at a rate of compensation equal
to the average annual eligible earnings during his or her last three years
before retiring. 

                -Retirement Practices-Appendix A...Page 1-

Reduction percentage appropriate to attained age at early retirement is:

                                 Percentage Appropriate
         Age                        to Attained Age

         58                               89.5%
         59                               91.0
         60                               92.5
         61                               94.0
         62                               95.5
         63                               97.0
         64                               98.5
         65                              100.0

Early retirement annual benefit from TI Employees Pension Trust is the annual
retirement benefit for an individual electing the option of single life
annuity annual payments for life from the TI Employees Pension Trust payable
at the individual's early retirement date. 

Although the annual supplemental early retirement payment from the calculation
above represents the annual payment payable for life, the employee may, at his
or her option, choose to have the benefit paid through age 68.  This adjusted
amount is calculated as follows: 

     (1)  Convert the annual payment if paid for life to a present value
          lump sum amount using the same lump sum conversion provision that
          is used for converting an annual pension payment for life to a
          lump sum payment for the TIer under the TI Pension Plan in effect
          at the time of retirement. 

     (2)  Convert the lump sum amount from (1) above to annual payment under
          early retirement agreement by multiplying the lump sum amount by
          the following factor: 

                    I (1 + I)N
                   ------------
                   (1 + I)N - 1
     Where

     I =  The annual interest rate used in the lump sum
          conversion table described in (1) above. 

     N =  One-twelfth of the number of whole calendar
          months which will expire between the date of
          the individual's retirement and the TIer's 69th
          birthday (N may be an improper fraction).

The payments, whether paid for life or through age 68, are converted to
monthly payments by dividing the annual payment by 12.

If a retiree elects payments through age 68 and should die before attaining
age 69, such payments shall be made to his or her heirs, legatees,
distributees, or personal representatives as if retiree were still living. 

                -Retirement Practices-Appendix A...Page 2-

If a retiree elects payments for life, he or she may elect a 50% joint and
survivors payment which will be computed by use of the factors in use for
computation of the joint and survivor annuity normal form of benefit payable
under the TI Employees Pension Plan at the TIer's early retirement date.

the Retiree shall forfeit all rights to any future payments he or she would
have received under this agreement.  The TI Board of Directors will in its
sole and absolute discretion determine at any time what business activities
compete substantially with the business of TI and also may waive the
provisions of this paragraph. 

     4.   Retiree shall not be an employee of TI hereunder.  Retiree shall
upon request of TI, unless prevented by valid reasons such as health, act as a
consultant to TI as an independent contractor for such periods of time (not

     5.   Retiree shall keep confidential, shall not use for his or her own
benefit and shall not disclose to others any nonpublic TI information learned
by Retiree in the course of his or her activities as a former employee of TI. 

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed these presents on

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF TEXAS INSTRUMENTS:

Strong performance in TI's semiconductor business led the company to one of
the best financial years in its history.  Earnings per share doubled from 1992
on a 15 percent increase in revenues.  The company set records for revenues,
profits and earnings per share in 1993.

Financial Summary
- -----------------
TI's net revenues for 1993 were $8523 million, compared with $7440 million in
1992.  Essentially all of the increase was in semiconductor revenues, with
strength across all major product lines and in all major geographic regions. 
Profit from operations was $728 million in 1993, up 73 percent from $420
million in 1992.  Higher semiconductor operating profits and higher royalties
accounted for virtually all of the increase.  Results for 1993 include a
profit-sharing accrual of $83 million.  There was no accrual for profit
sharing in 1992.  Net income for the year was $472 million, compared with $247
million in 1992.  Earnings per share were $5.03, compared with $2.50 per share
in 1992.  Results for the year include royalty revenues of $521 million,
compared with $391 million in 1992.  Profit after tax return on assets (PAT
ROA) was 8.1 percent, compared with 4.1 percent in 1992.  This represents
substantial progress toward our goal of achieving a sustainable 8-10 percent
PAT ROA to increase shareholder value.  

Results Validate Strategies
- ---------------------------
In the last few years, we have taken actions to reposition our businesses in
the marketplace and streamline operations across TI.  The improvement in our
financial performance shows that our strategies are working:

- --   About one-half of our semiconductor revenues are from differentiated
     products.  We believe TI's semiconductor revenues grew faster than the
     market in 1993 for the second consecutive year.  TI is gaining share in
     microprocessors.  We are the acknowledged leader in the rapidly growing
     digital signal processor market, and we have a strong position in the
     market for linear mixed-signal devices.  TI's bipolar business is
     shifting to advanced system logic, with new differentiated products for
     emerging markets in computers, consumer electronics and
     telecommunications.

- --   Our defense business is handling a difficult restructuring job
     exceptionally well, and continues to maintain stable margins and meet
     TI's goal for return on assets.  We are continuing to size for a smaller
     market, and we are winning new contracts and exploring opportunities for
     strategic growth.

- --   Our information technology activity is focused on building a major
     business in software productivity tools and applications.  The financial
     performance of this business in 1993 was below expectations.  We
     continue to strengthen our product position in client/server software. 
     We have moderated the planned growth rate for this business to focus on
     achieving acceptable profitability.

- --   Our materials and controls business has invested in several
     opportunities that could add substantial growth.  The TIRIS(TM) radio-
     frequency identification system was adopted by Ford in Europe for auto
     security.  The TIRIS system is an excellent example of applying our
     technology in creative ways to open new markets.


- --   We are becoming known as a valued business partner in every region of
     the world.  We strengthened our position as the number one foreign
     supplier to the Japanese semiconductor market in 1993.  Our revenues in
     the Asia-Pacific

                                     3

     region have doubled in the past two years and grew significantly faster
     than the market in 1993.  In Europe, we are building a strong position
     in semiconductors for the telecommunications market based on alliances
     with the market leaders.  

- --   We have established a mechanism for nurturing potentially breakthrough
     opportunities that fall outside our current businesses.  We've made
     substantial investments to develop the digital micromirror device
     (DMD)(TM) technology.  We are still assessing the business potential for
     this technology, but it could offer a significant opportunity for the
     future.  

Pursuing Operational Excellence
- -------------------------------
We could not have achieved these results without making significant changes in
the way we operate.  Our success has come from the efforts of thousands of
teams of TIers, dedicated to quality and willing to make the changes necessary
to improve processes and satisfy our customers.  

We believe there is a strong correlation between commitment to total quality
and improvement in financial measures such as profitability and cash flow. 
Our semiconductor business has consistently achieved greater than 90 percent
on-time delivery performance and has reduced manufacturing cycle times by more
than half in the last two years.  Customer recognition of these achievements
has resulted in more than 100 quality awards in that time, including the Total
Quality Excellence Award from Ford.  The reduction in cycle time and other
operational improvements contributed significantly to the increase in
semiconductor revenues in 1993.  In addition, they also have resulted in
improved cash flow and lower inventories relative to revenues.  In what we
believe to be a record for the industry, TECH Semiconductor, the joint-venture
facility in Singapore, achieved volume production of four-megabit DRAMs in
December, only three months after initial qualification.  Our defense
electronics business, a 1992 winner of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
Award, consistently turns in strong financial performance.  As part of its
strategy for achieving business excellence, TI Europe has adopted the European
Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) criteria, which are similar to the
Baldrige criteria and accepted by European customers.  This focus on cycle
time and quality has contributed to greater productivity for TI as a whole,
with net revenues per person improving by about 40 percent in the last two
years.

Building for the Future
- -----------------------
In addition to turning in record financial performance, we are also doing the
things needed for the future.  In late 1993, we combined our consumer and
peripheral products businesses to create a new operation focused on products
that enhance personal productivity.  While this required a pretax charge in
the fourth quarter, we expect the consolidation, when fully implemented, to
result in annual savings of about $25 million through more efficient
operations and combined marketing channels.  We will continue to streamline
operations as necessary in all of our businesses.

At the same time, we have added and converted resources to take advantage of
new market opportunities.  With higher royalties, we were able to increase
research and development (R&D) investments by $120 million in 1993, to $590
million.  We expect to increase these investments to about $700 million in
1994, with most of the increase supporting new semiconductor technologies.  We
have also strengthened our patent evaluation and filing process.  In the past
three years, TI has received about 1,200 new patents.  Several of these are in
technology areas that we believe will be important to the future of the
electronics industry, including video graphics, signal processing, memory
modules, and advanced semiconductor packaging.  We believe these new patents
strengthen our intellectual property portfolio for the future.

We also invested $730 million in capital in 1993.  We began construction of a
new wafer-fabrication facility in Dallas.  The initial phase is expected to
reduce sharply the time required to get new semiconductor products from
research to vol-

                                     4

ume production.  Capital expenditures in 1994 are expected to be about $1
billion, primarily for expansion of submicron CMOS semiconductor capacity,
including investments in the new Dallas facility.

New TI Leadership Structure
- ---------------------------
Building on what we have accomplished in the last few years, and to prepare
for the next phase of growth, we established a new leadership structure for
the company in December 1993.  We created an Office of the Chief Executive,
and a Strategy Leadership Team composed of TI senior officers.  This team will
be the focal point for key decisions in the company.  This structure embodies
a management philosophy based on teamwork and partnership.  It gives top
managers more time to spend with customers, it promotes faster and better
decisions, and it will help us build a more integrated, global company that
can take full advantage of growth opportunities around the world.  

Outlook
- -------
For 1994, we believe world semiconductor demand will grow in line with the
long-term trend of about 15 percent, as the major economies of the world
continue to experience low inflation rates and increased capital spending to
improve productivity.  While weakness in the economies of Japan and Germany
will restrain the pace of near-term market growth, the strength of U.S.
electronics and the emergence of new markets in Asia provide sufficient
opportunities to continue steady growth in our semiconductor business.  

For the longer term, conservative capacity additions relative to revenues and
continued tight control of semiconductor inventories by end-equipment
manufacturers should lead to greater stability for the semiconductor industry. 
This means more orderly growth around the long-term trend line.  Such an
environment would provide the opportunity to continue our emphasis on
operational improvements and productivity gains, helping to achieve our goal
for return on assets.

In defense electronics, we expect to see continued market decline in 1994,
with a dampening effect on TI's defense revenues.  

Because of actions taken in the last several years, TI today is much more
competitive in world markets.  Our priorities for 1994 are to implement the
new leadership and organization changes, to achieve further improvement in
total cycle time and quality, and to continue improving our productivity. 
Success in these areas will contribute to achieving our goal of a sustainable
8-10 percent profit after tax return on assets.  We believe this level of
performance provides an appropriate return to our shareholders while allowing
us to reinvest in the business, achieve continually higher levels of customer
satisfaction, and build an increasingly productive, rewarding work
environment.

                     Notes to Financial Statements

Accounting Policies and Practices                              
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted two new accounting standards: 
SFAS No. 106, which requires the accrual of expected retiree health care
benefit costs during the employees' working careers, and SFAS No. 109, which
requires increased recording of deferred income tax assets.  This resulted in
a charge of $294 million ($3.14 per share) for SFAS No. 106 and a credit of
$290 million ($3.10 per share) for SFAS No. 109, for the cumulative effect of
the accounting changes.

   The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all
subsidiaries.  Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting.  With
regard to accounts recorded in currencies other than U.S. dollars, current
assets (except inventories), deferred income taxes, other assets, current
liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in
effect at year end.  Inventories, property, plant and equipment and
depreciation thereon are remeasured at historic exchange rates.  Revenue and
expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the
appropriate month-end rate of exchange.  Net currency exchange gains and
losses from remeasurement and currency exchange contracts to hedge exposure
are charged or credited to income currently.  Gains and losses from currency
and interest exchange contracts to hedge specific transactions are included in
the measurement of the related transactions.

   Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, current replacement cost or
estimated realizable value.  Cost is generally computed on a currently
adjusted standard (which approximates current average costs) or average basis
except for the cost of certain inventories of metals and metal products, which
are computed on the LIFO basis.

   For the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, royalty revenue of $521 million, $391
million and $256 million is included in net revenues.  Royalty revenue is
recognized by the company upon fulfillment of its contractual obligations and
determination of a fixed royalty amount, or, in the case of ongoing royalties,
upon sale by the licensee of royalty-bearing products, as estimated by the
company.

   Substantially all depreciation is computed by either the declining-
balance method (primarily 150 percent declining method) or the sum-of-the-
years-digits method.  Fully depreciated assets are written off against
accumulated depreciation.

   Earnings (loss) per common and common equivalent share are based on
average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (93,605,749 shares,
85,310,690 shares and 81,970,372 shares for 1993, 1992 and 1991).  Shares
issuable upon exercise of dilutive stock options and upon conversion of
dilutive conversion preferred stock and convertible debentures are included in
average common and common equivalent shares outstanding.  In computing per-
share earnings, "net income, less dividends accrued on preferred stock" is
increased by $19 million and $4 million in 1993 and 1992 for dividends and
interest (net of tax and profit sharing effect) on the conversion preferred
stock and convertible debentures considered dilutive common stock equivalents.

Short-Term Investments                                         
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Short-term investments consist primarily of commercial paper, notes and short-
term U.S. government securities with original maturities beyond three months
stated at cost, which approximates market value.  Similar items with original
maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.

</TABLE>
    Approximately 34% and 43% of the December 31, 1993 and 1992, inventories
before progress billings related to long-term contracts.

    Revenues under long-term fixed price and fixed-price incentive contracts
are recognized as deliveries are made or as performance targets are achieved.
Revenues under cost-reimbursement contracts are recorded as costs are incurred
and include estimated earned fees.

    Inventories related to long-term contracts are stated at actual production
costs, including manufacturing overhead and special tooling and engineering
costs, reduced by amounts identified with revenues recognized on units
delivered or with progress completed.  Such inventories are reduced by
charging any amounts in excess of estimated realizable value to cost of
revenues.  The costs attributed to units delivered under long-term contracts
are based on the estimated average cost of all units to be produced under
existing firm orders and are determined under the learning curve concept,
which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production
techniques become more efficient through repetition.  Production costs
included in inventories in excess of the estimated cost of in-process
inventories (on the basis of estimated average cost of all units to be
produced) were not material.

    The replacement cost of LIFO inventories exceeded the carrying cost, which
was immaterial, by approximately $29 million at December 31, 1993, and $30
million at December 31, 1992.

                                    24

    To secure access to additional semiconductor plant capacity, TI entered
into three joint ventures formed to construct and operate semiconductor
manufacturing capacity.  Upon formation of the ventures TI contributed
technology and cash to acquire minority interests and entered into long-term
inventory purchase commitments with each joint venture.  Under the agreements,
TI purchases the output of the ventures at prices based upon percentage
discounts from TI's average selling prices.  Certain venturers have the right
to buy a portion of the output from TI.  Under certain circumstances, TI may
increase its ownership and potentially acquire a majority interest in the
ventures.  Under the ventures' financing arrangements, the venturers have
provided certain debt and other guarantees.  At December 31, 1993 and 1992, TI
was contingently liable for an aggregate of $43 million and $61 million of
such guarantees.  Inventory purchases from the ventures aggregated $356
million and $66 million in 1993 and 1992.  Receivables from and payables to
the ventures were $6 million and $45 million at December 31, 1993, and $4
million and $15 million at December 31, 1992.  Purchases prior to 1992 were
insignificant.  TI purchases are expected to increase in 1994.

during a 30-day period beginning in September 1994.  The debentures are
convertible at the holder's option into an aggregate 2,413,273 shares of TI
common stock at a common stock conversion price of $82.875 per share.

    The coupon rates for the notes due 1999, 2001 and 2003 have been swapped
for commercial paper-based variable rates through March 1995 for an effective
interest rate of approximately 6.4% and 6.5% as of December 31, 1993 and 1992.
The 9.0% notes due 1999 may be redeemed at par, at the company's option,
beginning in July 1996.  The Italian lira mortgage notes, and related swaps,
are due in installments through 2003.  The mortgage notes are collateralized
by real estate and equipment.

    Interest paid on loans (net of amounts capitalized as a component of
construction costs) was $54 million in 1993, $51 million in 1992 and $33
million in 1991.

    At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the fair value of long-term debt, based on
current interest rates, was approximately $998 million and $965 million,
compared with the carrying amount of $905 million and $925 million.

    Unused lines of credit for short-term financing were approximately $569
million at December 31, 1993 and $595 million at December 31, 1992.  Of these
amounts, $470 million and $477 million were available to support commercial
paper borrowings.

                       Notes to Financial Statements

Financial Instruments and Risk Concentration
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Financial instruments:  In addition to the swaps discussed in the preceding
note, the company has forward currency exchange contracts outstanding totaling
$239 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, to hedge exposure and transactions
denominated in European and East Asian currencies.  At December 31, 1993 and
1992, the settlement values of these swaps and forward contracts, based on
current market rates, were not significant.  These financial instruments are
designed to minimize exchange rate risks and financing costs in the regular
course of business.

    The company has an agreement to sell, on a revolving basis, up to $175
million of an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of
accounts receivable, with limited recourse.  Accounts receivable are shown net
of $175 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992, representing receivables sold. 
The comparable amount for December 31, 1991 is $175 million.  The related
discount expense, which varies with commercial paper rates, is included in
other income (expense) net.  The agreement expires November 1995 and may be
terminated earlier by either party under certain circumstances.

    Risk concentration:  Financial instruments which potentially subject the
company to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash investments and
accounts receivable.  The company places its cash investments in investment
grade, short-term debt instruments and limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one commercial issuer.  Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the
receivables are limited due to the large number of customers in the company s
customer base, and their dispersion across different industries and geographic
areas.  The company maintains an allowance for losses based upon the expected
collectibility of all accounts receivable, including receivables sold.

Stockholders' Equity
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.  The
following series of preferred stock have been issued:

    Market auction preferred stock:  On August 9, 1991, all outstanding shares
were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for new market auction preferred stock
with a higher maximum dividend rate.  In November 1993, all of the remaining
$75 million of these shares were redeemed by the company at their
liquidation value of $100,000 per share.  Dividends, which were cumulative,
were set every 49 days through auction procedures.  The dividend rates (per
annum) averaged 3.2%, 5.3% and 6.5% in 1993, 1992 and 1991.  Dividends
declared per share averaged $2,564, $5,239 and $6,230 in 1993, 1992 and 1991.

    Money market preferred stock:  The shares outstanding prior to August 9,
1991 were convertible into TI common stock; on August 9, 1991, all such shares
were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for new non-convertible money market
preferred stock with a higher maximum dividend rate.   In October 1993, all of
the remaining $74.6 million of these shares were redeemed by the company at
their liquidation value of $100,000 per share.  Dividends, which were
cumulative, were set every 49 days through auction procedures.  The dividend
rates (per annum) averaged 3.4%, 5.4% and 6.6% in 1993, 1992 and 1991.
Dividends declared per share averaged $2,729, $5,138 and $6,520 in 1993, 1992
and 1991.

    Series A conversion preferred stock:  Each Series A conversion preferred
share was represented by four depositary shares, for a total of 11,114,000
depositary shares.  The depositary shares were redeemable, at the company's
option, in exchange for TI common stock having a market value equal to a
predetermined call price specified by the date of redemption.  In a series of
three redemptions of approximately equal numbers of shares, the company
redeemed all of its Series A Conversion Preferred Stock and related depositary
shares during 1993.  In exchange for the aggregate 11,114,000 depositary
shares redeemed, the company issued the following number of shares of TI
common stock:  2,412,829 on June 25; 2,025,024 on September 10; and 1,828,665
on September 27.

    Each outstanding share of the company's common stock carries a stock
purchase right.  Under certain circumstances, each right may be exercised to
purchase one one-hundredth of a share of the company's participating
cumulative preferred stock for $200.  Under certain circumstances following
the acquisition of 20% or more of the company's outstanding common stock by an
acquiring person (as defined in the rights agreement), each right (other than
rights held by an acquiring person) may be exercised to purchase common stock
of the company or a successor company with a market value of twice the $200
exercise price.  The rights, which are redeemable by the company at 1 cent per
right, expire in June 1998.

Stock Options
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company has stock options outstanding to participants under the Texas
Instruments Long-Term Incentive Plan, approved by stockholders on April 15,
1993.  Options are also outstanding under the 1974, 1984 and 1988 Stock Option
Plans; however, no further options may be granted under these plans.  Under
all these stockholder-approved plans, the exercise price per share may not be
less than 100 percent of the fair market value on the date of the grant.
Options granted become exercisable in such amounts, at such intervals and
subject to such terms and conditions as determined by the compensation
committee of the board of directors.

    Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the company may grant stock options,
including incentive stock options; restricted stock and restricted stock
units; performance units; and other stock-based awards, including stock
appreciation rights.  The plan provides for the issuance of 4,000,000 shares
of the company's common stock; in addition, if any option under the 1974, 1984
or 1988 Stock Option Plans terminates, then any unissued shares subject to the
terminated option become available for granting awards under the plan.  No
more than 1,000,000 shares of common stock may be awarded as restricted stock,
restricted stock units or other stock-based awards under the plan.

    The company also has stock options outstanding under an Employees Stock
Option Purchase Plan approved by stockholders in 1988.  The plan provides for
options to be offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a
percentage of the employee's prior year's compensation.  If the optionee
authorizes and does not cancel payroll deductions which, with interest, will
be equal to or greater than the purchase price, options granted become
exercisable 14 months, and expire not more than 27 months, from date of grant.

Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company provides various incentive plans for employees, including general
profit sharing and savings programs as well as an annual incentive plan for
key employees.  The company also provides pension and retiree health care
benefit plans in the U.S. and pension plans in certain non-U.S. locations.

    Profit sharing:  Profit sharing expense was $83 million in 1993.  There
was no profit sharing expense in 1992 or 1991.  Under the plans, unless
otherwise provided by local law, the company and certain of its subsidiaries
contribute a portion 

                                    27

                     Notes to Financial Statements

of their net profits according to certain formulas, but not to exceed the
lesser of 25% of consolidated income (as defined) before profit sharing and
income taxes or 15% of the compensation of eligible participants.  Unless
otherwise provided by local law, such contributions are invested in TI common
stock.

    Except in the event of company contributions in stock, investments in TI
common stock are made by the trustees through purchases of outstanding shares
or through purchases of shares offered from time to time by the company.  The
board of directors has authorized the issuance of previously unissued shares
for purposes of the plans; 712,404 of such shares were available for future
issuance at December 31, 1993.

    The trustees of the profit sharing plans purchased 626,670 outstanding
shares of TI common stock in 1993 (105,688 shares in 1992 and 310,256 shares
in 1991) and 209,464 previously unissued shares in 1993 (none in 1992 and
1991).

    Savings program:  The company provides a matched savings program whereby
U.S. employees' contributions of up to 4% of their salary are matched by the
company at the rate of 50 cents per dollar.  Contributions are subject to
statutory limitations.  The contributions may be invested in several
investment funds including TI common stock.  The company's expense under this
program was $21 million in 1993, $20 million in 1992 and $22 million in 1991.

    U.S. pension plan:  The company has a defined benefit plan covering most
U.S. employees with benefits based on years of service and employee's
compensation.  The plan is a career-average-pay plan which has been amended
periodically in the past to produce approximately the same results as a final-
pay type plan.  The board of directors of the company has expressed an intent
to make such amendments in the future, circumstances permitting, and the
expected effects of such amendments have been considered in calculating U.S.
pension expense.  The company's funding policy is to contribute to the plan at
least the minimum amount required by ERISA.  Plan assets consist primarily of
common stock, U.S. government obligations, commercial paper and real estate.

    The projected benefit obligations for 1993 and 1992 were determined using
assumed discount rates of 7.0% and 8.0% and assumed average long-term pay
progression rates of 4.25% and 6.7%.  The assumed long-term rate of return
on plan assets was 9.0%.

    Non-U.S. pension plans:  Retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees of the
company is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans.
Retirement benefits are based on years of service and employee's compensation,
generally during a fixed number of years immediately prior to retirement.
Funding policies are based on local statutes.  Plan assets consist primarily
of common stock, government obligations and corporate bonds.

    The range of assumptions used for the non-U.S. plans reflects the
different economic environments within the various countries.  The projected
benefit obligations were determined using a range of assumed discount rates of
4.75% to 9.0% in 1993 and 5.75% to 9.0% in 1992 and a range of assumed average
long-term pay progression rates of 4.0% to 7.0% in 1993 and 4.5% to 7.0% in
1992.  The range of assumed long-term rates of return on plan assets was 8.0%
to 10.0%.  Accrued pension at December 31 includes approximately $79 million
in 1993 and 1992 for two non-U.S. plans that are not funded.  Pension
accounting rules require recognition in the balance sheet of an additional
minimum pension liability equal to the excess of the accumulated benefit
obligation over the value of the plan assets.  A corresponding amount is
recognized as an intangible asset, not to exceed the amount of unrecognized
prior service cost, with the balance recorded as a reduction of stockholders'
equity.  As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the company has recorded an
additional non-U.S. minimum pension liability of $24 million and $47 million
and an equity reduction of $10 million and $37 million.

    Retiree health care benefit plan:  The company's U.S. employees are
currently eligible to receive, during retirement, specified company-paid
medical benefits.  The plan is contributory and premiums are adjusted
annually.  For employees retiring on or after January 5, 1993, the company has
specified a maximum annual amount per retiree, based on years of service, that
it will pay toward retiree medical premiums.  For employees who retired prior
to that date, the company maintains a consistent level of cost sharing between
the company and the retiree.  The company is pre-funding the plan obligation
in amounts determined at the discretion of management.  Plan assets consist
primarily of common stock, U.S. government obligations, commercial paper, and
state and local government obligations.

    Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which requires
the accrual of expected retiree health care benefit costs during the
employees' working careers, instead of when the claims are incurred.  The
company recorded an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $454
million and a related deferred income tax asset of $160 million, which
resulted in a $294 million charge ($3.14 per share) for the cumulative effect
of the accounting change.  Retiree health care benefit expense in 1992 and
1991 was computed on a claims-incurred basis.

    Expense of the retiree health care benefit plan includes the following
components:

    Retiree health care benefit amounts were determined using health care cost
trend rates of 11.0% for 1994 decreasing to 6.0% by 1999, and an assumed
discount rate of 7.0%.

                                    29

                     Notes to Financial Statements

Increasing the health care cost trend rates by 1% would have increased the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 by $39
million and 1993 plan expense by $5 million.  A trust holding a portion of the
plan assets is subject to federal income taxes at a 39.6% rate.  The assumed
long-term rate of return on plan assets, after taxes, was 7.3%.  Retiree
health care benefit expense was $24 million in 1992 and $21 million in 1991.

    Employment-reduction programs:  During 1991, the company implemented
special voluntary and involuntary employment-reduction programs and as a
result incurred pretax charges of $130 million in the second quarter, $55
million in the third quarter and $45 million in the fourth quarter of that
year.  The company recognized a $25 million pretax gain from the settlement of
the related pension obligation in the fourth quarter of 1991.

Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The company is engaged in the development, manufacture and sale of a variety
of products in the electrical and electronics industry for industrial,
government and consumer markets.  These products consist of components
(semiconductors, such as integrated circuits, discrete devices and
subassemblies, and electrical and electronic control devices); defense
electronics (such as radar systems, navigation systems, infrared surveillance
and fire control systems, defense suppression missiles, missile guidance and
control systems, and electronic warfare systems); and digital products (such
as software productivity tools, integrated enterprise information solutions,
notebook computers, printers, electronic calculators and learning aids, and
custom manufacturing services).  In fourth quarter 1992, the company sold its
commercial multiuser minicomputer systems and service operations.  In October
1991, the sale of substantially all the company's industrial automation and
control systems business was completed.  Both of these operations were part of
the digital products segment.  The company also produces metallurgical
materials (including clad metals, precision-engineered parts and electronic
connectors).

    The company's business is based principally on its broad semiconductor
technology and application of this technology to selected electronic end-
equipment markets.

    Industry segment and geographic area profit (loss) is not equivalent to
income (loss) before provision for income taxes and cumulative effect of
accounting changes due to exclusion of general corporate expenses, net
interest, currency exchange gains and losses, and other items along with
elimination of unrealized profit in assets.  Profit sharing expense is
allocated to segment results based on payroll costs.  Royalty revenue from
patent license agreements is included in the U.S. geographic net revenues and
(except for royalty revenue from microcomputer system patent license
agreements, which is included in the digital products segment) is principally
included in the components segment.

    Identifiable assets are those associated with segment or geographic area
operations, excluding unallocated cash and short-term investments, internal
company receivables and deferred income taxes.  Generally, revenues between
industry segments and between geographic areas are based on prevailing market
prices or an approximation thereof.<PAGE>

Income Taxes
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," which requires increased recording of deferred income tax
assets.  As a result, the company recorded additional deferred income tax
assets of $203 million, after a valuation allowance of $404 million, and
reduced deferred income tax liabilities by $87 million, which resulted in a
$290 million credit ($3.10 per share) for the cumulative effect of the
accounting change.

    With the exception of interarea elimination of unrealized profit in
assets, which increased $1 million in 1993, decreased $20 million in 1992, and
decreased $23 million in 1991, the remaining corporate items consist primarily
of general corporate expenses which are applicable to both U.S. and non-U.S.
operations.  These expenses, as well as U.S. research and development costs
allocated to non-U.S. operations, are generally deductible for tax purposes in
the U.S.

    Provision has been made for deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that dividend payments from such companies
are expected to result in additional tax liability.  The remaining
undistributed earnings (approximately $525 million at December 31, 1993) have
been indefinitely reinvested; therefore, no provision has been made for taxes
due upon remittance of these earnings.  Determination of the amount of
unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not
practicable.

    The primary components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities
at December 31 were as follows:

    At December 31, 1993, the net deferred income tax asset of $528 million
was presented in the balance sheet, based on tax jurisdiction, as deferred
income tax assets of $568 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $40
million.

    Temporary differences at December 31, 1992 consisted primarily of
inventory reserves and other reserves not yet deducted for tax purposes,
differences in depreciation rates and long-term contract valuation amounts,
and undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries.

    The company has aggregate non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately
$425 million.  Of this amount, $395 million expires through the year 2003 and
$30 million has no expiration.

    Income taxes paid were $231 million, $108 million and $22 million for
1993, 1992 and 1991.

facilities and also leases a portion of its data processing and other
equipment.  The lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal
provisions and require the company to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance
costs.

Report of Ernst & Young, Independent Auditors
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board of Directors
Texas Instruments Incorporated

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Texas
Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Texas
Instruments Incorporated and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the results of its operations and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

    As discussed in the "Profit Sharing and Retirement Plans" and "Income
Taxes" notes to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company changed its
method of accounting for retiree health care benefits and income taxes.

Management Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The management discussion and analysis of the company's financial condition
and results of operations consists of the letter to stockholders set forth on
pages 3 through 5 of this report and the following additional information:

1993 Results of Operations Compared with 1992
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  TI's orders for 1993 were $8595 million, up 12 percent from $7645 million
in 1992.  Significantly higher semiconductor orders in the components segment
were the primary contributor to the change.

  TI's net revenues for 1993 were $8523 million, compared with $7440 million
in 1992.  Essentially all of the increase was in semiconductor revenues in the
components segment, resulting primarily from new products and increased
shipments.  Royalty revenues for the year were $521 million, up 33 percent
from 1992.  The increase was primarily the result of new agreements with
personal computer manufacturers covering TI's computer systems patents and
higher shipments by licensees under TI's semiconductor patents.  Profit from
operations was $728 million in 1993, up 73 percent from $420 million in 1992. 
Higher semiconductor operating profits and higher royalties accounted for
virtually all of the increase.  Results for 1993 include a profit-sharing
accrual of $83 million.  There was no accrual for profit sharing in 1992.

  The income tax provision for 1993 is for U.S. and non-U.S. taxes, net of a
third-quarter increase in deferred tax assets for the effect of the increase
in the U.S. statutory rate.  TI's income tax rate for the year was 31.6
percent.  The fourth-quarter tax rate was 33.9 percent.  

  TI's orders for the fourth quarter of 1993 were $2247 million, compared
with $2211 million for the same period in 1992.  Higher semiconductor orders
in the components segment and a sharp increase in notebook computer orders in
the digital products segment offset a decline in defense electronics orders.  

  Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 1993 were $2374 million, up 19
percent from the fourth quarter of 1992.  Most of the increase was in
semiconductor revenues, resulting from new products and, to a lesser extent,
increased shipments and higher semiconductor prices.  Profit from operations
increased 75 percent to $198 million, from $113 million in the same period of
1992.  The improvement was in the components segment, reflecting improved
semiconductor operating results and higher royalties.  Semiconductor margins
continued their pattern of consistent improvement and were at double-digit
levels in the fourth quarter of 1993.

  Fourth-quarter 1993 results include an accrual of $31 million for profit
sharing and a pretax charge of $23 million related to the consolidation of
TI's consumer and peripheral products businesses.  There were no profit-
sharing accruals or consolidation charges in the fourth quarter of 1992.  Net
income in the fourth quarter of 1993 was $134 million, and earnings per share
were $1.42, compared with net income of $78 million and earnings per share of
$0.80 in the fourth quarter of 1992.  Royalty revenues in the fourth quarter
of 1993 were $133 million, compared with $89 million in the same period of
1992.  Virtually all of the royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of 1993
were related to licensee shipments during the quarter.

  TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1993, was $3805 million,
up $72 million from the end of 1992, as increases in semiconductor backlog
more than offset a decline in defense electronics.  Backlog was down $126
million from the end of the third quarter of 1993 because of a decline in
defense electronics backlog.  

  TI-funded R&D was $590 million for 1993 and $170 million for the fourth
quarter, compared with $470 million and $121 million for the same periods of
1992.  Customer-funded R&D was $391 million in 1993, compared with $421
million in 1992.

  Capital expenditures were $730 million in 1993 and $218 million in the
fourth quarter, compared with $429 million and $147 million in the same
periods of 1992. 

  Depreciation for 1993 was $617 million, compared with $610 million in 1992,
and $167 million in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with $156 million in
the same period of 1992.  Depreciation in 1994 is expected to be about $700
million.

Components Segment
Orders in the components segment were up 32 percent for the year, and revenues
up 28 percent, from 1992.  Components segment profit doubled from 1992, with
semiconductor operating improvement accounting for virtually all of the
increase.

For the fourth quarter of 1993, orders in the components segment were up 30
percent over the same period of 1992, with strong increases in semiconductor
orders.  Segment revenues were up 33 percent from the same period of a year
ago, reflecting higher semiconductor revenues.  Segment profit increased
substantially over the fourth quarter of 1992 because of improved
semiconductor operating performance and higher royalties.

Defense Electronics Segment
In TI's defense electronics segment, 1993 orders were down 26 percent from
1992 because Operation Desert Storm replenishment orders were not repeated in
1993.  Revenues were down 7 percent from 1992, primarily because of reduced
shipments of the High-Speed Antiradiation Missile.  Margins for the year were
essentially flat with 1992.

Fourth-quarter 1993 orders in defense electronics were down 48 percent from
the fourth quarter of 1992 because of the absence of Desert Storm-related
orders.  Revenues were down 4 percent from the fourth quarter of 1992. 
Revenues were up substantially from the third quarter of 1993, reflecting
shipments that were delayed from the third quarter and 

                                    35

the phasing of low-margin programs.  Margins remained stable from the fourth
quarter of 1992.

Digital Products Segment
Orders in TI's digital products segment were up 11 percent in 1993, and
revenues up 8 percent, compared with 1992.  Excluding the effect of the 1992
sale of TI's multiuser minicomputer systems and service operations to Hewlett-
Packard, 1993 orders were up 25 percent, and revenues up 24 percent, over
1992.  The segment operated at a profit for the year 1993, as royalty revenues
more than offset operating losses.

For the fourth quarter of 1993, orders in the digital segment were up 26
percent, and revenues were up 15 percent, from the same period of 1992. 
Before the effect of the $23 million consolidation charge, the segment was
essentially at breakeven in the fourth quarter of 1993, as royalty revenues
offset a loss in consumer products.  

Metallurgical Materials Segment
In the metallurgical materials segment, orders were up 12 percent, and
revenues were up 5 percent, from 1992.  The segment operated at a small loss
for the year, primarily because of increased investments in new technologies,
including solar energy.  In the fourth quarter of 1993, orders were up 11
percent, and revenues were up 11 percent, from the same period of 1992.  The
segment operated at a small loss in the fourth quarter of 1993.

Intellectual Property
During 1993, TI reached new semiconductor patent-license agreements with
Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd.  and Nippon Steel Semiconductor
Corporation.  We also reached computer systems patent-license agreements with
personal computer manufacturers including Compaq Computer Corporation, Daewoo
Electronics Company, Ltd., Daewoo Telecom Co., Ltd., Dell Computer
Corporation, Gateway 2000, Inc., Hyundai, Packard Bell Electronics, Inc.,
Toshiba Corporation, and Zenith Data Systems.

Litigation in Japan continues with Fujitsu Limited regarding TI s Japanese
patent on the invention of the integrated circuit (the  Kilby  patent).  TI is
seeking damages and injunctive relief, and Fujitsu is seeking a declaration
that Fujitsu products do not infringe the Kilby patent.  TI is also in
litigation in the United States with other companies concerning its patents
relating to semiconductors and computer systems.

Negotiations with additional potential semiconductor and personal-computer
licensees are ongoing.  These negotiations by their nature are not predictable
as to outcome or timing, and results may vary depending on the parties 
relative patent posture, the use by each party of the other s patents, the
sales volume of each party, and other factors.  TI continues to earn a
significant ongoing stream of royalty revenue.

Financial Condition
- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
TI's financial condition continued to strengthen in 1993.  The company made
further progress toward management's goal of reducing TI's debt-to-total-
capital ratio and generated positive cash flow net of additions to property,
plant and equipment.

During 1993, cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments increased
by $29 million to $888 million as of December 31, 1993.  Cash provided by
operating activities net of additions to property, plant and equipment was a
positive $204 million for the year.  In addition, the company raised $77
million of cash through the sale of common stock in conjunction with employee
benefit plans.  TI's debt-to-total-capital ratio was .28 at the end of the
year, down .01 from the third quarter and down .05 from year-end 1992.  TI's
goal is to reduce this ratio to about .25.

In a series of three redemptions of approximately equal numbers of shares, the
company redeemed all of its Series A Conversion Preferred Stock and related
depositary shares during 1993.  In exchange for the aggregate 11,114,000
depositary shares redeemed, the company issued the following number of shares
of TI common stock: 2,412,829 on June 25; 2,025,024 on September 10; and
1,828,665 on September 27.  At the end of the third quarter, the company
classified as a current liability its $200 million of 2.75 percent convertible
subordinated debentures due 2002, since these debentures may be redeemed at
the holder's option, by prior notice, during a 30-day period beginning
September 29, 1994.  In anticipation of this potential redemption, the company
is considering various financing alternatives.

On October 19 and November 2, 1993, the company redeemed its remaining two
series of auction-rate preferred stock (liquidation value $74.6 million and
$75.0 million, respectively) at liquidation value plus accrued and unpaid
dividends.

Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted a new FASB statement, SFAS No.
106, which requires the accrual of expected retiree health care benefit costs
during the employees' working careers, instead of when the claims are
incurred.  The company recorded an accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation of $454 million and a related deferred income tax asset of $160
million, which resulted in a $294 million charge ($3.14 per share) for the
cumulative effect of the accounting change.  In 1993, pretax expense for this
benefit plan was $41 million.  The aggregate pension and retiree health care
benefit expense is expected to be somewhat lower in 1994 than in 1993, as the
effect of lower interest rates is more than offset by the effect of favorable
investment returns, fewer employees and changes in other assumptions.  In
1992, pretax expense for retiree health care, on a claims-incurred basis, was
$24 million.  The company is partially funding the plan obligation.


                                    36

                    Supplemental Financial Information

Also adopted effective January 1, 1993, was SFAS No. 109, which requires
increased recording of deferred income tax assets.  As a result, the company
recorded additional deferred income tax assets of $203 million, after a
valuation allowance of $404 million, and reduced deferred income tax
liabilities by $87 million, which resulted in a $290 million credit ($3.10 per
share) for the cumulative effect of the accounting change.

The net effect of the two cumulative accounting change amounts was a $4
million charge ($0.04 per share).

At December 31, 1993, the company had deferred income tax assets of $568
million, after a valuation allowance of $350 million, and deferred income tax
liabilities of $40 million.  The valuation allowance reflects the company's
assessment regarding the realizability of certain non-U.S. deferred income tax
assets.  The balance of the deferred income tax assets is considered
realizable based on carryback potential, existing taxable temporary
differences, and expectation of future income levels comparable to recent
results.  Such future income levels are not assured because of the nature of
the company's businesses which are generally characterized by rapidly changing
technology and intense competition.  The company evaluates realizability of
the deferred income tax assets quarterly.

The company maintains unused lines of credit to support commercial paper
borrowing and to provide additional liquidity.  Unused lines of credit were
approximately $569 million at December 31, 1993.  Of this amount, $470 million
was available to support commercial paper borrowing.  

Authorizations for future capital expenditures were approximately $603 million
at December 31, 1993.  In view of greater semiconductor demand, we plan to
increase capital expenditures in 1994 to about $1 billion, from $730 million
in 1993.  The funds will be supplied by cash from operations and existing cash
balances.

The company believes that its financial condition provides the foundation for
continued support of the programs essential to TI's future.

1992 Results of Operations Compared with 1991
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TI's orders for 1992 were $7645 million, up 14 percent from $6725 million in
1991.  Significantly higher semiconductor orders in components were the
primary contributor to the change, along with replenishment orders in defense
electronics resulting from Operation Desert Storm.

    TI's net revenues for 1992 were $7440 million, compared with $6784
million in 1991.  Increased semiconductor revenues, across all major product
lines, were the largest contributor to this change. Profit from operations was
$420 million in 1992, compared with a loss from operations of $249 million in
1991.  Operating results improved in every TI business as a result of cost
savings and operating improvements, with the largest gain in semiconductors.
For 1991, charges for cost reductions, net of a pension settlement gain in the
fourth quarter, were $240 million.

    Net income for 1992 was $247 million, compared with a net loss of $409
million in 1991.

    The income tax provision for 1992 was for U.S. and non-U.S. taxes, net
of an increase in deferred tax assets.  For 1991, the provision was primarily
for non-U.S. taxes and a decrease in deferred tax assets.

    TI's backlog of unfilled orders as of December 31, 1992, was $3733
million, up $156 million from the end of 1991, primarily because of increases
in semiconductor backlog and replenishment orders in defense electronics.

    TI-funded R&D was $470 million in 1992, compared with $527 million in
1991.  Customer-funded R&D was $421 million in 1992, compared with $388
million in 1991.

    Capital expenditures were $429 million in 1992, compared with $504
million in 1991.

    Depreciation for 1992 was $610 million, compared with $590 million in
1991.

Components Segment
Orders in the components segment were up 20 percent for the year, and revenues
up 16 percent, from 1991.  Semiconductor operating results were substantially
improved from 1991, as a result of increased shipments, especially in
application-specific products; benefits from the cost reductions initiated in
1991; and operating improvements in memory.  The 1991 segment results included
charges of $121 million for cost reductions.

Defense Electronics Segment
In TI's defense electronics segment, 1992 orders were up 10 percent, and
revenues were up 3 percent, from 1991.  Margins in defense electronics were
essentially stable in 1992 compared with the previous year, after adjusting
for the 1991 cost-reduction charge of $67 million.

Digital Products Segment
Orders in TI's digital products segment were up 1 percent in 1992, and
revenues up 2 percent, compared with 1991.  The 1991 results included charges
of $31 million for cost reductions.  The segment operated at a profit in 1992.

Metallurgical Materials Segment
In the metallurgical materials segment, orders and revenues in 1992 were both
down 4 percent from 1991.  Revenues were affected by sluggish world economies
and resulting weakness in key markets.  Profits in 1992 were restrained by
new-venture investments for solar energy.

Intellectual Property
Net revenues for 1992 included royalty revenues of $391 million, compared with
$256 million in 1991.  The increase in 1992 took into consideration new
semiconductor patent-license agreements with Mitsubishi Electric Corporation;
Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd.; and six other Japanese semiconductor manufacturers.

                   Supplemental Financial Information


Inflation
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the limits of generally accepted accounting principles, the company
believes its financial statements tend to reasonably match current levels of
costs with revenues of the period, except for depreciation.  To the extent
current costs of fixed assets exceed historical costs, depreciation on an
inflation-adjusted basis would be greater than historical cost depreciation.

Common Stock Prices and Dividends

    Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted two new accounting
standards: SFAS No. 106, which requires accrual of expected retiree health
care benefit costs during the employees' working careers, and SFAS No. 109,
which requires increased recording of deferred income tax assets.  This
resulted in a first quarter charge of $294 million ($3.12 per share) for SFAS
No. 106 and a credit of $290 million ($3.08 per share) for SFAS No. 109, for
the cumulative effect of the accounting changes.

    Earnings per common and common equivalent share are based on average
common and common equivalent shares outstanding (94,154,923 shares and
95,713,491 shares for the fourth quarters of 1993 and 1992) and "net income,
less dividends accrued on preferred stock" ($133 million and $69 million for
the fourth quarters of 1993 and 1992).  In computing per-share earnings, "net
income, less dividends accrued on preferred stock" is increased by $1 million
and $7 million for the fourth quarters of 1993 and 1992 for dividends and
interest (net of tax and profit sharing effect) on the conversion preferred
stock and convertible debentures considered dilutive common stock equivalents.
