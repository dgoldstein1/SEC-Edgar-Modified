                                     PART I

ITEM 1.   Business. 

General
- -------
          Texas Instruments Incorporated (hereinafter the "Registrant," 
including subsidiaries except where the context indicates otherwise) is 
engaged in the development, manufacture, and sale of a variety of products in 
the electrical and electronics industry for industrial, government, and 
consumer markets.  These products consist of components, defense systems and 
electronics, and digital products.  The Registrant also produces metallurgical 
materials.  In addition, the Registrant's patent portfolio has been 
established as an ongoing contributor to the Registrant's revenues.  The 
Registrant's business is based principally on its broad semiconductor 
technology and application of this technology to selected electronic end-
equipment markets.  The Registrant from time to time considers acquisitions 
and divestitures which may alter its business mix.  The Registrant may effect 
one or more such transactions at such time or times as the Registrant 
determines to be appropriate.  

          The information with respect to net revenues, profit and 
identifiable assets of the Registrant's industry segments and operations 
outside the United States, which is contained in the note to the financial 
statements captioned "Industry Segment and Geographic Area Operations" on 
pages 35-37 of the Registrant's 1995 annual report to stockholders, is 
incorporated herein by reference to such annual report.

Components
- ----------
          Components consist of semiconductor integrated circuits (such as 
digital signal processors, mixed signal and analog circuits, microprocessors/ 
microcontrollers, applications processors, memories, and digital circuits), 
semiconductor discrete devices, semiconductor subassemblies (such as custom 
modules for specific applications), and electrical and electronic control 
devices (such as motor protectors, starting relays, circuit breakers, 
thermostats, sensors, and radio-frequency identification systems).

          These components are used in a broad range of products for 
industrial end-use (such as computers and peripheral equipment, 
telecommunications, instrumentation, and industrial motor controls and 
automation equipment), consumer end-use (such as televisions, cameras, 
automobiles, home appliances, and residential air conditioning and heating 
systems), and government end-use (such as defense and space equipment).  The 
Registrant sells these components primarily to original equipment 
manufacturers principally through its own marketing organizations and to a 
lesser extent through distributors.

Defense Systems and Electronics
- -------------------------------
          Defense systems and electronics consist of radar systems, navigation 
systems, infrared surveillance and fire control systems, defense suppression 
missiles, other weapon systems (including antitank and interdiction weapons), 
missile guidance and control systems, electronic warfare systems, and other 
defense electronic equipment.  Sales are made to the U.S. government (either 
directly or through prime contractors) and to international customers approved 
by the U.S. government.






                                       2

Digital Products
- ----------------
          Digital products include software productivity tools, mobile 
computing products, printers, and electronic calculators.  Subsequent to year-
end 1995, the Registrant reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the 
Registrant's custom manufacturing services business.

          Digital products are used in a broad range of enterprise-wide, work 
group and personal information-based applications.  The Registrant markets 
these products through various channels, including system suppliers, business 
equipment dealers, distributors, retailers, and direct sales to end-users and 
original equipment manufacturers.

Metallurgical Materials
- -----------------------
          Metallurgical materials include clad metals, precision-engineered 
parts and electronic connectors for use in a variety of applications such as 
appliances, automobiles, electronic components, and industrial and 
telecommunications equipment.  These metallurgical materials are primarily 
sold directly to original equipment manufacturers.

Competition
- -----------
          The Registrant is engaged in highly competitive businesses.  Its 
competitors include several of the largest companies in the United States, 
Asia, and elsewhere abroad as well as many small, specialized companies.  
The Registrant is a significant competitor in each of its principal 
businesses.  Generally, the Registrant's businesses are characterized by 
rapidly changing technology which has, throughout the Registrant's history, 
intensified the competitive factors, primarily performance and price. 

Government Sales
- ----------------
          Net revenues directly from federal government agencies in the United 
States, principally related to the defense systems and electronics segment, 
accounted for approximately 8% of the Registrant's net revenues in 1995.

          Contracts for government sales generally contain provisions for 
cancellation at the convenience of the government.  In addition, companies 
engaged in supplying military equipment to the government are dependent on 
congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, and may be 
affected by changes in government policies resulting from various military and 
political developments.  See "ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings."

Backlog
- -------
          The dollar amount of backlog of orders believed by the Registrant to 
be firm was $4528 million as of December 31, 1995 and $3913 million as of 
December 31, 1994.  Approximately 18% of the 1995 backlog (involving defense 
systems and electronics) is not expected to be filled within the current year.  
The backlog is significant in the business of the Registrant only as an 
indication of future revenues which may be entered on the books of account of 
the Registrant. 










                                       3

Raw Materials
- -------------
          The Registrant purchases materials, parts and supplies from a number 
of suppliers.  The Registrant's silicon materials operation became part of a 
joint venture with MEMC Electronic Materials, Inc., in May 1995.  The 
Registrant retains a minority ownership interest in the joint venture.  The 
materials, parts and supplies essential to the Registrant's business are 
generally available at present and the Registrant believes at this time that 
such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable 
future, although the Registrant has experienced some extended lead times on 
certain raw materials, particularly for silicon wafers, because of the rapid 
industry growth over the past three years.

Patents and Trademarks
- ----------------------
          The Registrant owns many patents in the United States and other 
countries in fields relating to its business.  The Registrant has developed a 
strong, broad-based patent portfolio.  The Registrant also has several 
agreements with other companies involving license rights and anticipates that 
other licenses may be negotiated in the future.  The Registrant does not 
consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent 
license, although taken as a whole, the rights of the Registrant and the 
products made and sold under patents and patent licenses are important to the 
Registrant's business.  As noted above, the Registrant's patent portfolio has 
been established as an ongoing contributor to the revenues of the Registrant.  
See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations" and "ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings."

          The Registrant owns trademarks that are used in the conduct of its 
business.  These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which 
are "Texas Instruments" and the Registrant's corporate monogram. 

Research and Development
- ------------------------
          The Registrant's research and development expense was $927 million 
in 1995 compared with $689 million in 1994 and $590 million in 1993.

Seasonality
- -----------
          The Registrant's revenues are subject to some seasonal variation. 

Employees
- ---------
          The information concerning the number of persons employed by the 
Registrant at December 31, 1995 on page 21 of the Registrant's 1995 annual 
report to stockholders is incorporated herein by reference to such annual 
report.

ITEM 2.   Properties.

          The Registrant's principal offices are located at 13500 North 
Central Expressway, Dallas, Texas.  The Registrant owns and leases plants in 
the United States and 16 other countries for manufacturing and related 
purposes.  The following table indicates the general location of the principal 
plants of the Registrant and the industry segments which make major use of 
them.  Except as otherwise indicated, the principal plants are owned by the

          The Registrant's facilities in the United States contained 
approximately 18,300,000 square feet as of December 31, 1995, of which 
approximately 4,300,000 square feet were leased.  The Registrant's facilities 
outside the United States contained approximately 7,000,000 square feet as of 
December 31, 1995, of which approximately 1,800,000 square feet were leased. 

          The Registrant believes that its existing properties are in good 
condition and suitable for the manufacture of its products.  At the end of 
1995, the Registrant utilized substantially all of the space in its 
facilities. 

          Leases covering the Registrant's leased facilities expire at varying 
dates generally within the next 10 years.  The Registrant anticipates no 
difficulty in either retaining occupancy through lease renewals, month-to-
month occupancy or purchases of leased facilities, or replacing the leased 
facilities with equivalent facilities.


                                       5

ITEM 3.   Legal Proceedings.

          On January 1, 1996, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Federal 
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against Samsung Electronics 
Co., Ltd. of Korea, and its two U.S. subsidiaries ("Samsung"), seeking 
injunctive relief, alleging that Samsung is in violation of several of the 
Registrant's patents relating to the manufacture of semiconductor devices, 
including DRAMs.  Also on that date, Samsung brought a lawsuit in Federal 
District Court for the Northern District of Texas seeking injunctive relief 
against the Registrant, alleging that the Registrant is infringing several of 
Samsung's patents, and seeking a declaratory judgment that certain of the 
Registrant's patents are either invalid, not infringed or unenforceable 
against Samsung and that certain of the Registrant's intellectual property 
licensing practices are unfair.  

Separately, on January 16, 1996, the Registrant filed a complaint with the 
International Trade Commission (the "ITC") under Section 337 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (the "Tariff Act"), charging that Samsung's importation 
and sale in the U.S. of electronic products that are produced using processes 
covered by the Registrant's patents is an unfair act.  The complaint seeks a 
permanent exclusion order preventing Samsung from importing and selling 
products that infringe the Registrant's patents in the U.S. On February 12, 
1996, Samsung filed a complaint with the ITC under Section 337 of the Tariff 
Act charging that the Registrant's importation and sale in the U.S. of certain 
semiconductor products, including DRAMs that include structures covered by 
Samsung's patents and that are produced using processes covered by Samsung's 
patents, is an unfair act.  Samsung's complaint seeks a permanent exclusion 
order preventing the Registrant from importing and selling semiconductor 
products in the U.S.  See "ITEM 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

          On July 19, 1991, the Registrant filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District 
Court against Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu") seeking injunctive relief, alleging 
that Fujitsu's manufacture and sale of certain DRAMs infringe the Registrant's 
Japanese patent on the invention of the integrated circuit (the "Kilby" 
patent).  Concurrently, Fujitsu brought a lawsuit in the same court against 
the Registrant, seeking a declaration that Fujitsu is not infringing the Kilby 
patent.  On August 31, 1994, the district court ruled that Fujitsu's 
production of 1-megabit and 4-megabit DRAMs and 32K EPROMs does not infringe 
the Kilby patent.  The Registrant has appealed the court's decision to the 
Tokyo High Court.

          The Registrant is included among a number of U.S. defense 
contractors which are currently the subject of U.S. government investigations 
regarding alleged procurement irregularities.  The Registrant is unable to 
predict the outcome of the investigations at this time or to estimate the 
kinds or amounts of claims or other actions that could be instituted against 
the Registrant.  Under present government procurement regulations, such 
investigations could lead to a government contractor's being suspended or 
debarred from eligibility for awards of new government contracts for an 
initial period of up to three years.  In the current environment, even matters 
that seem limited to disputes about contract interpretation can result in 
criminal prosecution.  While criminal charges against contractors have 
resulted from such investigations, the Registrant does not believe such 
charges would be appropriate in its case and has not, at any time, lost its 
eligibility to enter into government contracts or subcontracts under these 
regulations.

          The Registrant is involved in various investigations and proceedings 
conducted by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and certain state 



                                       6

environmental agencies regarding disposal of waste materials.  Although the 
factual situations and the progress of each of these matters differ, the 
Registrant believes that the amount of its liability will not have a material 
adverse effect upon its financial position or results of operations and, in 
most cases, the Registrant's liability will be limited to sharing clean-up or 
other remedial costs with other potentially responsible parties.

                     TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN
                          As Amended November 30, 1995



The Texas Instruments Annual Incentive Plan is designed to provide an 
additional incentive for those employees who are key to the Company's success 
in the highly technological and competitive industries in which it operates.  
The Plan provides for rewarding certain employees by awards for outstanding 
ability and exceptional service based upon the individual's contribution to the 
Company.

For purposes of the Plan unless otherwise indicated, the term "Company" shall 
mean Texas Instruments Incorporated and its subsidiaries of which substantially 
all of the voting stock is owned directly or indirectly by Texas Instruments. 

Eligibility

The employees of the Company eligible to receive awards under the Plan shall 
consist of the group of employees (including officers and directors) in 
management or other key positions specified for each year by the Committee 
described below and such other employees as said Committee may designate for 
such year. If an employee takes an approved leave of absence or dies prior to 
a determination of awards to be made under the Plan for a year in which the 
employee was eligible to receive awards under the Plan, such employee on leave 
or the estate of such deceased employee shall be eligible to receive awards 
under the Plan for such year.  Directors who are not full-time or part-time 
officers or employees are not eligible to participate in the Plan.  

Administration of Plan 

The Plan shall be administered by a Committee of the Board of Directors which 
shall be known as the Compensation Committee (the Committee) which shall be 
appointed by a majority of the whole Board and shall consist of not less than 
three directors.  The Board may designate one or more directors as alternate 
members of the Committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at 
any meeting of the Committee.  A director may serve as a member or alternate 
member of the Committee only during periods in which he is a "disinterested 
person" as described in Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as in effect from time to time.  No member or alternate member of the Committee 
shall be eligible, while a member or alternate member, for participation in the 
Plan.  The Committee shall have full power and authority to construe, interpret 
and administer the Plan.  It may issue rules and regulations for administration 
of the Plan.  It shall meet at such times and places as it may determine.  A 
majority of the members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum and all 
decisions of the Committee shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all 
parties, including the Company, the stockholders and the employees. 

The Committee shall have the full and exclusive right to make awards under the 
Plan except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan.  In determining the 
selection of recipients and the amount or form of any award, the Committee 
shall take into consideration the contribution of the recipients during the 
fiscal year to the Company's success and such other factors as the Committee 
shall determine.  The Committee shall have the authority to consult with and 


                                       17

receive recommendations from officers or other executives of the Company with 
regard to these matters.  

The Committee may delegate such power, authority and rights with respect to the 
administration of the Plan as it deems appropriate to one or more members of 
the management of the Company (including, without limitation, a committee of 
one or more members of management appointed by the Committee); provided, 
however, that the Committee shall have the exclusive right to make awards to 
employees who are directors or officers of the Company, and that any delegation 
to management shall conform with the requirements of the General Corporation 
Law of Delaware, as in effect from time to time.  

Expenses of Administration 

The expenses of the administration of this Plan, including the dividend 
equivalents and interest provided in the Plan, shall be borne by the Company 
and none of them shall be charged against the Incentive Reserve described 
below. 

Amendments 

The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time and from time to time, 
alter, amend, suspend or terminate the Plan or any part thereof as it may deem 
proper and in the best interests of the Company, provided, however, that no 
such action shall affect or impair the rights under any award theretofore 
granted under the Plan, except that in the case of an employee employed outside 
the United States (or his beneficiary) the Board may vary the provisions of the 
Plan as it may deem appropriate to conform with local laws, practices and 
procedures.  Further, unless the stockholders of the Company shall have first 
approved thereof, no amendment shall be made which shall increase the maximum 
amount which may be credited to the Incentive Reserve described below in any 
year.

Awards

Awards may be made from time to time during each year under the Plan by the 
Committee or its delegate(s) in amounts which do not exceed the amount then 
available in the Incentive Reserve described below.  Such awards may be 
denominated in cash, in shares of the Company's common stock, or both, and may 
be payable in cash or shares, or both, as the Committee may determine.

Scope of the Plan

The Committee shall have the power, in its sole discretion, to determine what 
payments to eligible employees shall be deemed to be incentive compensation for 
the purposes of this Plan.  Awards under the Company's Patent Incentive Award 
program shall be deemed not to have been made under this Plan and payments 
under the Patent Incentive Award program shall not be charged to the Incentive 
Reserve described below.  Payments under any incentive plans which operational 
organizations of the Company may have from time to time to any employees who 
are then eligible to receive awards under this Plan shall be charged to the 
Incentive Reserve described below.  Special payments to employees involved in 
unusual transactions (including, without limitation, a sale of a portion of the 
business of the Company) shall not be charged to the Incentive Reserve 
described below unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  Nothing in this 
Plan shall be construed as preventing the Company from having from time to time 
incentive or other variable compensation plans applicable to employees who are 



                                       18

not then eligible to participate in this Plan, and payments of incentive or 
other variable compensation under such plans to such employees shall not be 
charged to the Incentive Reserve described below.

Incentive Reserve

For the calendar year 1965 and each of the calendar years thereafter, the Board 
of Directors shall cause to be credited to an Incentive Reserve (hereinafter 
called the Reserve) an amount determined as follows: 

     10% of the amount by which the Company's net income for such year exceeds 
     6% of net capital but not in excess of the amount paid out as dividends on 
     the common stock of the Company during such year, except that the Board 
     may in its discretion direct that a lesser amount be credited.

As used in this Plan

     1.  "Net income" shall mean the amount reported as net income in the 
         annual statement of income for the year as shown by the annual report 
         to stockholders plus interest on long-term debt and amounts credited 
         to the Reserve for such year.

     2.  "Net capital" shall mean the total of stockholders' equity plus long-
         term debt (less current portion) as shown on the balance sheet as of 
         the end of the year preceding the year for which net income, as above, 
         is determined plus treasury stock held for the purposes of this Plan.

As soon as practicable after the end of each year, the Company's independent 
auditors shall determine and report to the Board of Directors the maximum 
amount creditable to the Reserve for that year under the provisions of this 
Plan.  The Board shall determine the amount to be credited to the Reserve for 
such year.  Prior to receipt of such report of the auditors, the Board may make 
such determination based on an estimate made by the Company's Chief Financial 
Officer of the maximum amount creditable, provided that such a determination 
shall be effective only upon receipt of the auditors' report by the Secretary 
of the Board of Directors and only to the extent of the maximum amount 
creditable to the Reserve, as reported by the auditors.  The amount determined 
by the Board shall be credited to the Reserve as of the close of the year.  The 
Committee shall promptly be advised of the amount so credited to the Reserve 
and of the total amount available in the Reserve (after deducting any unpaid 
installments of incentive awards previously granted).

The Committee shall make a determination of awards to be made under the Plan 
for each year at such time or times as the Committee shall deem appropriate.  
The aggregate of such awards may be less than, but shall not exceed, the total 
amount available in the Reserve, except that, after the end of a year and prior 
to the Board's determination of an amount to be credited to the Reserve for 
that year, the Committee may make awards in excess of the amount available in 
the Reserve if such awards are made payable only if an amount adequate to cover 
such awards is first credited to the Reserve for such year. 

If the aggregate of the awards determined by the Committee to be made under the 
Plan for a given year shall at any time be less than the total amount available 
in the Reserve, the Committee may at any time or times determine that 
additional awards be made under the Plan for such year, provided that the 
aggregate of all awards for such year shall not exceed the total amount 
available in the Reserve, and that all awards for such year shall be determined 
on or before December 31 of the following year. 


                                       19

If (i) the amount determined and reported by the Company's independent auditors 
as the maximum amount creditable to the Reserve for any year shall for any 
reason later prove to have been overstated and (ii) the amount credited to the 
Reserve at the close of such year was in excess of the revised maximum amount 
creditable to the Reserve for that year, then the amount available at that time 
or subsequently in the Reserve shall be reduced by the amount of such excess.  
Thus excess credits to the Reserve resulting from such overstatement shall be 
corrected exclusively by adjustment of the Reserve then or subsequently 
available and not by recourse to any person.  

Any balance remaining in the Reserve after making awards for any year shall 
continue in the Reserve and be available for awards for future years except to 
the extent otherwise directed by the Committee.  Any payments that are made by 
the Company, and any incentive awards that are granted by, or become 
obligations of, the Company, through the assumption by the Company of, or in 
substitution for, outstanding awards previously granted by an acquired company 
shall not, except in the case of payments made to or incentive awards granted 
to employees who are officers or directors of the Company for purposes of 
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, be charged to 
the Reserve.

Payment of Awards 

Incentive awards may be made in cash or in Texas Instruments common stock, or 
partly in cash and partly in stock as the Committee in its discretion may 
determine.  Incentive awards made wholly or partly in stock, or any 
installments thereof, may be paid wholly or partly in cash as the Committee in 
its discretion may determine.  

The Company shall make available as and when required a sufficient number of 
shares of its common stock for the purpose of this Plan.  Such common stock 
shall be either authorized and unissued shares or treasury stock. 

Authorized and unissued shares and treasury stock shall be valued for the 
purpose of awards and charged to the Reserve at the simple average of the high 
and the low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite Tape on 
the date the awards are made by the Committee (or if there shall be no trading 
on that date, then on the first previous date on which there is such trading). 
Authorized and unissued shares and treasury stock shall be valued for the 
purpose of payments in cash of awards made in stock, at the simple average of 
the high and the low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite 
Tape on the payment date (or if there shall be no trading on that date, then on 
the first previous date on which there is such trading).  

The Committee may direct the awards to the participants or any of them for any 
year to be paid in a single amount or in installments of equal or varying 
amounts and may prescribe such terms and conditions concerning payment of such 
installments as it deems appropriate, including completion of specific periods 
of employment with the Company or achievement of specific goals established by 
the Committee, as it deems appropriate, provided that such terms and conditions 
are not more favorable to a participant than those expressly set forth in this 
Plan.  The Committee may determine that dividend equivalents or interest, as 
applicable, will be payable with respect to any installments of any award.  The 
Committee may at any time after an incentive award is made amend any such 
direction and may amend or delete any such terms and conditions concerning 
payment of installments, if the Committee deems it appropriate.  




                                       20

When the obligation to pay an installment or installments of an award has 
terminated for any reason, the amounts relating to such installment or 
installments shall be added back to the Reserve and shall be available for use 
under this Plan.  

Appropriate adjustments in incentive awards payable in Texas Instruments common 
stock shall be made to give effect to any mergers, consolidations, 
acquisitions, stock splits, or other relevant changes in capitalization 
occurring after the effective date of this Plan; however, no fractional shares 
shall be distributed. 

Payments of awards to employees of subsidiaries of the Company shall be paid 
directly by such subsidiaries.  

Withholding

Whenever a participant is obligated to pay to the Company an amount required to 
be withheld under applicable income tax laws in connection with the payment of 
stock pursuant to an award under this Plan, such payment may be made (a) in 
cash, or (b) to the extent from time to time approved by the Committee, (i) in 
Texas Instruments common stock or (ii) partly in cash and partly in Texas 
Instruments common stock.  For purposes of any payment in Texas Instruments 
common stock, such stock shall be valued at the simple average of the high and 
low prices of Texas Instruments common stock on the Composite Tape on the date 
that the payment in stock becomes taxable (or if there is no trading on that 
date, then on the first previous date on which there is such trading).
