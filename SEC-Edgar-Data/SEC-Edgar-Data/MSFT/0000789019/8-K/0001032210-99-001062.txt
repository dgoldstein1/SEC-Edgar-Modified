Item 5. Other Events.

     On June 30, 1999, Microsoft announced it would change the way that it
reports revenue and costs associated with product support, consulting, Internet
access, and certification of system integrators.  Henceforth, amounts received
from customers from these activities will be classified as revenue in a manner
consistent with Microsoft's primary businesses.  Direct costs of these
activities will be classified as cost of revenue.  Prior financial statements
have been reclassified for consistent presentation and are set forth as Exhibits
99.1 and 99.2 hereto.  Attached hereto as Exhibit 27 are restated Financial Data
Schedules for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1998 and June 30, 1997, and for
the quarters ending March 31, 1999, December 31, 1998, September 30, 1998,
March 31, 1998, December 31, 1997, and September 30, 1997.

     Microsoft has also announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission is
conducting a non-public investigation into the Company's accounting reserve
practices.  Management currently believes that the resolution of this
investigation will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial
position or its results of operations.

Item 7.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.

     The Exhibits to this report are listed in the Index to Exhibits on page 3.
