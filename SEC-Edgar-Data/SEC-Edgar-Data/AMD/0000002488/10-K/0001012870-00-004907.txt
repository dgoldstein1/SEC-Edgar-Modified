FUJITSU AMD SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

In 1993, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Fujitsu Limited (Fujitsu) formed a
joint venture, Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited (FASL or the Company), for the
development and manufacture of non-volatile memory devices. Through FASL, the
two companies have constructed and are operating an advanced integrated circuit
manufacturing facility in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, to produce Flash memory
devices. FASL also uses a foundry facility in Iwate, Japan. AMD has a 49.992%
interest in FASL, and Fujitsu has the remaining interest.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

FISCAL YEAR.  The Company's fiscal year ends March 31.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. The accounting records of the Company are maintained in
accordance with accounting practices prevailing in Japan. The accompanying
financial statements, however, include adjustments that have not been recorded
in the legal books of account of the Company but are necessary to conform to
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S.
GAAP). These adjustments consist principally of depreciation under a different
method and its impact on the valuation of inventories, provision for deferred
income taxes, and adjustments stemming from the translation of the Company's
financial statements into the U.S. dollar for reporting purposes.

CASH EQUIVALENTS.  Cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are
readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or
less at the time of acquisition.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. The functional currency of the Company is the
Japanese yen. Financial statements are translated into the U.S. dollar using the
exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities and a
weighted-average exchange rate for each period for income statement items.
Translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of stockholders'
equity in the U.S. dollar financial statements.

REVENUE RECOGNITION.  Revenue is recognized from sales when products are shipped
to the customer.

UNIT SELLING PRICE. In June 1999, a new transfer price agreement, which includes
the basis for determining the unit selling price, was approved by the Board of
Directors. Under the old transfer price agreement, the unit selling price to
Fujitsu and AMD was calculated based on a percentage of their ultimate average
selling price at a predetermined, nonnegotiable exchange rate. Under the new
transfer price agreement, the unit selling price is calculated using
approximately 106 percent of cost of sales based on the Commercial Code in
Japan. The change is retroactively applied to the unit selling price of products
shipped on and after April 1, 1999.

FUJITSU AMD SEMICONDUCTOR LIMITED
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INVENTORIES. Inventories are stated at the lower of actual cost (average method)
or market (net realizable value).

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost.
Depreciation for U.S. GAAP purposes is provided on the straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes and on
accelerated methods for tax purposes. Estimated useful lives for financial
reporting purposes are as follows: machinery and equipment 3 to 5 years;
buildings up to 26 years.

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE. Net income (loss) per share has been
computed using the weighted-average common shares outstanding.  The Company has
no potentially dilutive securities.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In 1999, the Financial Standards Board extended
the adoption date of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" (FAS 133). FASB
Statement No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," an
amendment of SFAS 133, defers implementation of SFAS until fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company will adopt FAS 133 in fiscal 2001.
FAS 133 will require the Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance
sheet at a fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair
value. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the
change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments
through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings. The portion of a derivative's change in fair
value is ineffective as a hedge will be immediately recognized in the results of
operations. The Company does not currently use derivative instruments; therefore
SFAS 133 is expected to have no impact on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows.

In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No 101, "Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements" or SAB 101. SAB 101 provides guidance on
the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial
statements. In recent actions, the SEC has further delayed the required
implementation date which, for the Company, will be the fourth quarter of fiscal
2000, retroactive to the beginning of the fiscal year. The SEC has indicated
that additional implementation guidance will be forthcoming in the form of
"Frequently Asked Questions," however, such guidance has not been issued to
date. Although the Company cannot fully assess the impact of SAB 101 until the
additional guidance from the SEC is issued, the Company is still in the process
of assessing the impact of SAB 101 on its results of operations, financial
position, and cash flows based upon the most current information.

USE OF ESTIMATES. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ
from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial
statements.

FINANCIAL PRESENTATION. The Company has reclassified certain prior year amounts
on the financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company is 100 percent owned by AMD and Fujitsu, with AMD having a 49.992%
interest, and Fujitsu having the remaining interest. Under the terms of the
joint venture agreement, FASL production is allocated nearly equally between AMD
and Fujitsu. All of the Company's accounts receivable and sales as of and for
the years ended March 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 were with these related parties.
FASL made purchases from AMD and Fujitsu totaling $59 million, $49 million and
$62 million in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. At March 31, 2000 and 1999,
FASL owed AMD, Fujitsu and Fujitsu's subsidiaries approximately $36 million and
$142 million, respectively, which consisted of loan, trade and royalty payables.

The Company has an agreement with Fujitsu Capital Limited (FCAP), a wholly owned

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

subsidiary of Fujitsu, to provide financing to FASL at lower interest rates than
banks. Had the Company obtained financing from a lender other than FCAP, the
additional interest expense would have been immaterial. FASL completed
construction of the building for a second Flash memory device wafer fabrication
facility, FASL II, in the third quarter of 1997 at a site contiguous to the
existing FASL facility in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan. Equipment installation is in
progress and the facility is expected to cost approximately $1 billion when
fully equipped. Approximately $439 million of the cost of the facility has been
funded as of March 31, 2000. Capital expenditures for FASL II construction to
date have been funded by cash generated from FASL operations and borrowings by
FASL. However, to the extent that FASL is unable to secure the necessary funds
for FASL II, AMD and Fujitsu may be required to contribute cash or guarantee
third-party loans in proportion to their respective interests in FASL. At March
31, 2000, AMD and Fujitsu did not have any loan guarantees outstanding with
respect to such loans. The planned FASL II costs are denominated in yen and are
therefore subject to change due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.

The Company has a severance benefit package for employees formerly employed by
Fujitsu. FASL accrues the Company's share of severance benefits at year-end in
an amount to be settled with Fujitsu if the eligible employee terminates their
service with FASL and returns to Fujitsu or another Fujitsu group company.

4.  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS

As required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 (SFAS
130), unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments,
are included in other comprehensive loss.

As of March 31, 2000 and March 31, 1999 the components of accumulated other
comprehensive loss, consisting only of cumulative translation adjustments, were
$ 8,464,000 and $71,057,000, respectively.

5.  INCOME TAXES

6. SEGMENT REPORTING

As required by SFAS 131, the Company has determined it has only one principle
business and one reportable segment: non-volatile memory devices. FASL derives
all of its revenues from sales of only one product, Flash memory devices, and is
not organized by multiple operating segments for the purposes of making
operating decisions or assessing performance. Accordingly, the Company operates
in one reportable segment.

The Company derives revenues from its sales to AMD and Fujitsu. All long-lived
assets are located in Japan.

7. COMMITMENTS

At March 31, 2000, the Company had commitments of approximately $154 million for
the purchase and installation of equipment in FASL facilities.

The Company leases the land from Fujitsu under an agreement that expires May 31,
2023. The lease fee is revised every three years based on the fair market value
of the land. In addition, certain manufacturing equipment is used under
operating lease contracts. For each of the next five years and beyond, lease
obligations are:

8. RETAINED EARNINGS

The amount of retained earnings available for dividends under the Commercial
Code in Japan is based on the amount recorded in the Company's books maintained
in accordance with Japanese accounting practices. The adjustments included in
the accompanying financial statements but not recorded in the books as explained
in Note 2 have no effect on the determination of retained earnings available for
dividends under the Commercial Code in Japan.

9. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On July 20, 2000, FASL broke ground for a third fabrication facility for the
manufacture of Flash memory devices in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan. The facility,
designated as JV3, is expected to cost approximately $1.3 billion when fully
equipped. Capital expenditures for JV3 construction to date have been funded by
cash generated from FASL operations and borrowings by FASL.

                        Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor Limited

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor
Limited as of March 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related statements of
operations, stockholders', equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended March 31, 2000. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

We have also reported separately on the financial statements of Fujitsu AMD
Semiconductor Limited for the same years prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in Japan.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Fujitsu AMD Semiconductor
Limited at March 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2000 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

          Subject to variations in the voting powers, designations, preferences

     (B)  Common Stock
          ------------

          (1)  After the requirements with respect to preferential dividends
          upon all classes and series of stock entitled thereto shall have been
          paid or declared and set apart for payment and after the corporation
          shall have complied with all requirements, if any with respect to the
          setting aside of sums as a sinking fund or for a redemption account on
          any class of stock, then and not otherwise, the holders of Common

          distributed to the holders of all classes and series of stock entitled
          thereto in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
          dissolution or winding up of the corporation, the holders of the
          Common Stock shall be entitled to receive all the remaining assets of
          the corporation.

          (3)  Each holder of Common Stock shall have one vote in respect of
          each share of such stock held by him, subject, however, to such
          special voting rights by class as are or may be granted to holders of
          Serial Preferred Stock with respect to the election of a limited
          number of directors upon default by the corporation in the payment of
          dividends of such Serial Preferred Stock.

     FIFTH. In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred by
     statute, the Board of Directors is expressly authorized:

          To make, alter or repeal the Bylaws of the corporation.

          When and as authorized by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-
          thirds of the stock issued and outstanding having voting power given
          at a stockholders' meeting duly called upon such notice as is required
          by stature, or when authorized by the written consent of the holders
          of two-thirds of the voting stock issued and outstanding, to sell,
          lease or exchange all or substantially all of the property and assets
          of the corporation, including its

                                       3
<PAGE>

          good will and its corporate franchises, upon such terms and conditions
          and for such consideration, which may consist in whole or in part of
          money or property including shares of stock in, and/or other
          securities of, any other corporation or corporations, as the Board of
          Directors shall deem expedient and for the best of interests of the
          corporation.

     SIXTH.  Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
     Delaware, as the Bylaws may provide.  The books of the corporation may be
     kept (subject to any provision contained in the statutes) outside the State
     of Delaware at such place or places as may be designated from time to time
     by the Board of Directors or in the Bylaws of the corporation.  Elections
     of directors need not be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the
     corporation shall so provide.

     SEVENTH.  The corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
     repeal any provision contained in this certificate of incorporation, in the
     manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred
     upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

     EIGHTH.  A director of the corporation shall not be personally liable to
     the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of
     fiduciary duty as a director, except liability (i) for any breach of the
     director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for
     acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct
     or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the Delaware
     General Corporation Law, or (iv) for any transaction from which the
     director derived an improper personal benefit.

     If the Delaware General Corporation Law hereafter is amended to authorize
     the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then
     the liability or a director of the corporation, in addition to the
     limitation on personal liability provided herein, shall be limited to the
     fullest extent permitted by the amended Delaware General Corporation Law.
     Any repeal or modification of this Article by the stockholders of the
     corporation shall be prospective only, and shall not adversely affect any
     limitation on the personal liability of a director of the corporation for
     acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such amendment.
