       NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. Basis of Presentation

   The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of
   Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the Company or AMD) have been prepared in
   accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim
   financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10
   of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the results of operations for the interim
   periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be
   expected for the full fiscal year ending December 26, 1999. In the opinion of
   the Company's management, the information contained herein reflects all
   adjustments necessary to make the results of operations for the interim
   periods a fair statement of such operations. All such adjustments are of a
   normal recurring nature. The interim financial statements should be read in
   conjunction with the financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on
   Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 1998.

   The Company uses a 52- to 53-week fiscal year ending on the last
   Sunday in December.  The quarters ended June 27, 1999 and June 28, 1998 each
   included 13 weeks.

   Certain prior year amounts on the condensed consolidated financial
   statements have been reclassified to conform to the 1999 presentation.

2. Restructuring and Other Special Charges

   Restructuring and other special charges were $17.5 million in the second
   quarter of 1999 and $15.0 million in the first quarter of 1999. These charges
   were the result of the Company's efforts to better align its cost structure
   with expected revenue growth rates. The restructuring efforts resulted in
   non-cash charges for the:

     . closure of a submicron development laboratory facility;
     . write-off of equipment in the Submicron Development Center (SDC);
     . write-off of equipment taken out of service in Fab 25, the Company's
       integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing facility located in Austin, Texas,
       related to the 0.35-micron wafer fabrication process; and
     . write-off of capitalized costs related to discontinued system projects.

  Cash charges consisted of:

     . severance and benefits to terminated employees including 50 employees in
       the Information Technology department and 128 employees in the SDC and
       sales offices;
     . costs for leases of vacated and unused sales offices; and
     . costs for the disposal of equipment taken out of service in Fab 25 and
       the SDC.

  The Company's remaining reserves for severance and employee benefits will be
  paid during the third quarter of 1999. The Company anticipates that the
  remaining reserves for sales office facilities will be utilized over the
  period through lease termination in the second quarter of 2002. The remaining
  reserves for the equipment disposal costs will be fully discharged by the
  first quarter of 2000.

4. Debt

   The 1996 syndicated bank loan agreement (the Credit Agreement) provided for a
   $150 million three-year secured revolving line of credit and a $250 million
   four-year secured term loan. On June 25, 1999, we terminated the secured
   revolving line of credit. Approximately $86 million of the four-year secured
   term loan was outstanding as of June 27, 1999. As of June 27, 1999, we were
   in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. In July 1999, we
   repaid the outstanding balance on the secured term loan, terminated the
   Credit Agreement and replaced the Credit Agreement with a new Loan and
   Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with a consortium of banks led by
   Bank of America. Under the Loan Agreement, which provides for a four-year
   secured revolving line of credit of up to $200 million, we can borrow up to
   85 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from Original Equipment
   Manufacturers (OEMs) and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from
   distributors, subject to reserves which may be set aside by the lenders. The
   Company will be subject to compliance with certain financial covenants if the
   levels of domestic cash it holds declines to certain levels, or the amount of
   borrowings under the Loan Agreement rises to certain levels. Our obligations
   under the Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of most of our accounts
   receivable, inventory, general intangibles and the related proceeds.

5. Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

   Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted-
   average common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per common share is
   computed using the weighted average common shares outstanding plus any
   potential dilutive securities. Dilutive securities include stock options,
   restricted stocks, warrants and convertible debt. The following table sets
   forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common
   share:

   Options to purchase 8,223,255 shares of common stock at a weighted-average
   price of $17.48 per share were outstanding during the quarter ended June 27,
   1999, but were not included in the computation of diluted net income per
   common share because the options' exercise price was greater than the average
   market price of the common shares during the period. Options and restricted
   stock were outstanding during the quarter ended June 28, 1998 and both of the
   six month periods ended June 27, 1999 and June 28, 1998, but were not
   included in the computation of diluted net loss per common share because the
   effect in periods with a net loss would be antidilutive. Warrants and
   convertible debt were outstanding during both of the six month periods ended
   June 27, 1999 and June 28, 1998, but were not included in the computation of
   diluted net loss per common share because the effect in periods with a net
   loss would be antidilutive.

6. Investment in Joint Venture

   In 1993, AMD and Fujitsu Limited formed a joint venture, Fujitsu AMD
   Semiconductor Limited (FASL), for the development and manufacture of non-
   volatile memory devices. FASL operates

                                       9
<PAGE>

   advanced IC manufacturing facilities in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, to produce
   Flash memory devices. The Company's share of FASL is 49.992 percent and the
   investment is being accounted for under the equity method. As of June 27,
   1999, the cumulative adjustment related to the translation of the FASL
   financial statements into U.S. dollars resulted in a decrease in the
   investment in FASL of $34 million. The following are the significant FASL
   related-party transactions and balances:

7. Segment Reporting

   During the six months ended June 27, 1999, AMD had two principal businesses
   and had two reportable segments: (1) the AMD segment, which consists of three
   product groups-Computation Products Group, Memory Group and Communications
   Group, and (2) the Vantis segment, which consists of the Company's
   programmable logic subsidiary, Vantis Corporation (Vantis). The reportable
   segments were organized as discrete and separate functional units with
   separate management teams and separate performance assessment and resource
   allocation processes. The AMD segment produces microprocessors, core logic
   products, Flash memory devices, Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory
   (EPROM) devices, telecommunication products, networking and

                                       10
<PAGE>

   input/output (I/O) products and embedded processors. The Vantis segment
   produced complex and simple, high-performance complementary metal oxide
   semiconductor (CMOS) programmable logic devices (PLDs).

   On June 15, 1999, AMD completed the sale of Vantis to Lattice Semiconductor
   Corporation. Therefore, results from the second quarter of 1999 included
   operations of the Vantis segment only through June 15, 1999. (See Note 8.)

   The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in
   the summary of significant accounting policies contained in the Company's
   financial statements in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
   December 27, 1998. The Company evaluates performance and allocates resources
   based on segment operating income (loss).

8. Sale of Vantis Corporation

   On June 15, 1999, AMD sold Vantis to Lattice Semiconductor Corporation for
   approximately $500 million in cash.  AMD received, net of cash and cash
   equivalents of about $46 million held by Vantis, approximately $454 million.
   AMD's pre-tax gain on the sale of Vantis was $432 million,

                                       11
<PAGE>

    subject to adjustment, if any, based on the final determination of the net
    asset value of Vantis at June 15, 1999. The gain is computed based on
    Vantis' preliminary net assets as of June 15, 1999 and other direct expenses
    related to the sale. The applicable tax rate on the gain was 40 percent.

    Subsequent to the Vantis sale, the Company will continue to provide services
    to Vantis pursuant to various re-negotiated service contracts. According to
    the service contracts, the Company will continue to provide, among other
    things, wafer fabrication and assembly, test, mark, pack services to Vantis.
    The wafer, fabrication and assembly, test, mark and pack service agreements
    will continue until September 2003.

    9.  Comprehensive Income (Loss)

    Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting
    Comprehensive Income," unrealized gains or losses on the Company's
    available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments
    are included in other comprehensive loss.

10. Contingencies

    AMD V. ALTERA CORPORATION. This litigation, which began in 1994, involves
    multiple claims and counterclaims for patent infringement relating to AMD's
    and Altera Corporation's programmable logic devices. In a trial held in May
    1996, a jury found that five of the eight AMD patents-

                                      12
<PAGE>

  in-suit were licensed to Altera. As a result of the bench trial held in August
  1997, the Court held that Altera was licensed to the three remaining AMD
  patents-in-suit. Seven patents were asserted by Altera in its counterclaim
  against AMD. The Court determined that the Company is licensed to five of the
  seven patents and two remain in suit. Altera filed a motion to recover
  attorneys' fees in November 1997. The Company then filed, and the Court
  granted, a motion to stay determination of the attorneys' fees motion until
  resolution of its appeal. The Company filed an appeal of the rulings of the
  jury and Court determinations that Altera is licensed to each of its eight
  patents-in-suit. Both parties filed briefs and the Federal Court of Appeal
  heard oral argument on our appeal in November 1998. In April 1999, the Federal
  Court of Appeal reversed the earlier jury and Court decisions and held that
  Altera is not licensed to the eight AMD patents-in-suit. Also in April 1999,
  and following the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, Altera filed a
  petition for rehearing. In June 1999, in connection with the sale of Vantis to
  Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, AMD transferred this proceeding and
  substantially all of its rights and liabilities relating to this action to
  Vantis.

  SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATIONS.  Between March 10, 1999 and April 22,
  1999, AMD and certain individual officers of AMD were named as defendants in
  the following lawsuits: Arthur S. Feldman v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et
  al.; Pamela Lee v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Izidor Klein v.
  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Nancy P. Steinman v. Advanced Micro
  Devices, Inc., et al.; Robert L. Dworkin v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et
  al.; Howard M. Lasker v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; John K.
  Thompson v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Dan Schwartz v. Advanced
  Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Serena Salamon and Norman Silverberg v. Advanced
  Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; David Wu and Hossein Mizraie v. Advanced Micro
  Devices, Inc., et al.; Eidman v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Nold v.
  Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Freeland v. Advanced Micro Devices,
  Inc., et al.; Fradkin v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. et al.; Ellis Investment
  Co. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Dezwareh v. Advanced Micro
  Devices, Inc., et al.; and Tordjman v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.
  These class action complaints allege various violations of federal securities
  law, including violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and
  Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Most of the complaints purportedly were
  filed on behalf of all persons, other than the defendants, who purchased or
  otherwise acquired common stock of AMD during the period from October 6, 1998
  to March 8, 1999. Two of the complaints allege a class period from July 13,
  1998 to March 9, 1999. All of the complaints allege that materially misleading
  statements and/or material omissions were made by AMD and certain individual
  officers of AMD concerning design and production problems relating to high-
  speed versions of the AMD-K6(R)-2 and AMD-K6-III microprocessors. The
  complaints seek unspecified damages, equitable relief, interest, fees and
  other litigation costs.

  The Company expects that these suits will be consolidated into one action
  within the next several months. AMD intends to contest the litigation
  vigorously. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company
  does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits will have a
  material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

During the six months ended June 27, 1999, we participated in all three
technology areas within the digital integrated circuit (IC) market - memory
circuits, logic circuits and microprocessors - through (1) our AMD segment,
which consists of our three product groups - Computation Products Group (CPG),
Memory Group and Communications Group and (2) our Vantis segment, which
consisted of our former programmable logic subsidiary, Vantis Corporation
(Vantis). CPG products include microprocessors, core logic products and embedded
processors. Memory Group products include Flash memory devices and Erasable
Programmable Read-Only Memory (EPROM) devices. Communications Group products
include telecommunication products, networking, and input/output (I/O) products.
Vantis products are complex and simple high-performance complementary metal
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) programmable logic devices (PLDs).

On June 15, 1999, we completed the sale of our Vantis segment to Lattice
Semiconductor Corporation for approximately $500 million in cash. The actual
cash received was approximately $454 million, which was net of Vantis' cash and
cash equivalent balance of approximately $46 million as of the closing.

The following is a summary of the net sales of the AMD and Vantis segments for
the periods presented below:

Net Sales Comparison of Quarters Ended June 27, 1999 and March 28, 1999

Net sales for the second quarter of 1999 decreased by six percent compared to
the first quarter of 1999.

CPG net sales of $317 million decreased 20 percent in the second quarter of 1999
compared to the first quarter of 1999 due primarily to a decrease in sales of
microprocessors.  Net sales from our AMD-K6(R) family of microprocessors
substantially declined from the previous quarter as a result of aggressive Intel
marketing, pricing and product bundling. Unit shipments declined approximately
14 percent, and the average selling price declined approximately 15 percent for
our AMD-K6 family of microprocessors compared to the previous quarter. We expect
net sales from our AMD-K6

                                       15
<PAGE>

family of microprocessors to decline due to the decreasing average selling
prices. CPG sales growth during the remainder of 1999 is dependent on a
successful production ramp and market acceptance of our AMD Athlon(TM)
microprocessor, as to which we cannot give any assurance.

Memory Group net sales of $166 million increased by 32 percent in the second
quarter of 1999 compared to the first quarter of 1999 as a result of strong
growth in unit shipments of Flash memory devices at higher average selling
prices, slightly offset by a decline in unit shipments of EPROM devices.  Demand
for Flash memory devices, particularly in the cellular phone industry, grew
during the second quarter of 1999.  Demand for EPROM devices continues to
decline due to a shift away from EPROM devices to Flash memory devices.  As a
result of this ongoing trend, we continue to expect future EPROM sales to
decline.

Communications Group net sales of $70 million increased nine percent in the
second quarter of 1999 compared to the first quarter of 1999.  This was due to
an increase in unit shipments of telecommunication products as a result of
improved Asian and world economies, particularly in China and Latin America.
This increase was partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of
communication products due to price pressures, and a decrease in net sales of
networking products.  Sales of our new higher-performance networking products
have not grown enough to offset the decline in sales of our older products.

Vantis net sales of $40 million decreased 15 percent in the second quarter of
1999 compared to the first quarter of 1999, primarily as a result of only 11
weeks of sales in the second quarter due to the sale of Vantis on June 15, 1999,
as compared to a full 13 weeks of sales in the prior quarter.

Net Sales Comparison of Quarters Ended June 27, 1999 and June 28, 1998

Net sales for the second quarter of 1999 increased by 13 percent compared to the
second quarter of 1998.

CPG net sales increased by 17 percent in the second quarter of 1999 compared to
the same quarter in the previous year due primarily to an increase in sales of
microprocessors.  Unit shipments of our AMD-K6 family of microprocessors
increased 40 percent as a result of our development of a broader and stronger
customer base and more competitive products.  This increase in unit shipments
was partially offset by a 20 percent decrease in average selling prices.
Aggressive Intel marketing, pricing and product bundling in the second quarter
of 1999 caused the decline of the average selling price of our AMD-K6 family of
microprocessors compared to the same period in 1998. We expect net sales from
our AMD-K6 family of microprocessors to decline due to the decreasing average
selling prices. CPG sales growth during the remainder of 1999 is dependent on a
successful production ramp and market acceptance of our AMD Athlon
microprocessor, as to which we cannot give any assurance.

Memory Group net sales increased by 26 percent in the second quarter of 1999
compared to the second quarter of 1998.  We experienced significant growth in
unit shipments of Flash memory devices, which were partially offset by lower
average selling prices of Flash memory devices and lower net sales of EPROM
devices.  Demand for Flash memory devices, particularly in the cellular phone
industry, grew during the second quarter of 1999.  Demand for EPROM devices

                                       16
<PAGE>

continues to decline with the shift away from EPROM devices to Flash memory
devices.  As a result of this ongoing trend, we continue to expect future EPROM
sales to decline.

Communications Group net sales were relatively flat in the second quarter of
1999 compared to the second quarter of 1998.  This was due to a combination of a
slight decrease in net sales of telecommunication products and a slight increase
in net sales of networking products.

Vantis net sales decreased by 23 percent in the second quarter of 1999 compared
to the second quarter of 1998.  This decrease was due to lower sales of SPLD
products which were partially offset by higher sales of CPLD products, as well
as only 11 weeks of sales in the second quarter due to the sale of Vantis on
June 15, 1999, as compared to a full 13 weeks of sales in the second quarter of
1998.

Net Sales Comparison of Six Months Ended June 27, 1999 and June 28, 1998

Net sales for the first half of 1999 increased by 15 percent compared to the
first half of 1998.

CPG net sales increased by 42 percent in the first half of 1999 compared to the
first half of 1998.  Our net sales of AMD-K6 family of microprocessors doubled
during this period.  Growth in our AMD-K6 family of microprocessors was
primarily driven by a 91 percent increase in unit shipments which resulted from
our development of a stronger customer base and more competitive products.
Aggressive Intel marketing, pricing and product bundling in the first half of
1999 caused the decline of the average selling price of our AMD-K6 family of
microprocessors from the first half of 1998. We expect net sales from our AMD-K6
family of microprocessors to decline due to the decreasing average selling
prices. CPG sales growth during the remainder of 1999 is dependent on a
successful production ramp and market acceptance of our AMD Athlon
microprocessor, as to which we cannot give any assurance.

Memory Group net sales decreased two percent in the first half of 1999 compared
to the first half of 1998 due to lower net sales of EPROM devices.  This
decrease was partially offset by slightly higher net sales of Flash memory
devices as a result of growing demand for Flash in the latter part of the
period.  Demand for EPROM devices continues to decline with the shift away from
EPROM devices to Flash memory devices.  As a result of this ongoing trend, we
continue to expect future EPROM sales to decline.

Communications Group net sales decreased 16 percent in the first half of 1999
compared to the first half of 1998. This decrease was a result of fewer
unit shipments as well as lower average selling prices of both telecommunication
and networking products. During the later part of the period, sales of our
telecommunication products increased, but not enough to have a significant
impact on the full period. Sales of our new higher-performance networking
products have not grown enough to offset the decline in sales of our older
products.

                                       17
<PAGE>

Vantis net sales decreased 19 percent in the first half of 1999 compared to the
first half of 1998. This decrease was due to lower sales of SPLD products which
were partially offset by higher sales of CPLD products, as well as only 24 weeks
of sales in the first half of 1999 due to the sale of Vantis on June 15, 1999,
as compared to a full 26 weeks of sales in the first half of 1998.

</TABLE>

We operate in an industry characterized by high fixed costs due to the capital-
intensive manufacturing process, particularly due to the state-of-the-art
production facilities required for microprocessors.  As a result, gross margin
is significantly affected by fluctuations in product sales.  Gross margin
percentage growth is dependent on increased sales from microprocessor and other
products as fixed costs continue to rise due to additional capital investments
made as we continue to expand production capacity.

Gross margin percentage of 23 percent in the second quarter of 1999 decreased
from 29 percent in the first quarter of 1999.  The decrease in gross margin
percentage was due to lower net sales of microprocessors and higher fixed costs.
Fixed costs will continue to increase as we introduce equipment for 0.18-micron
process technology capacity and facilitize Fab 25, our IC manufacturing facility
in Austin, Texas.  Dresden Fab 30 will also contribute to an increase in cost of
sales at the time it begins producing units for sale, which we anticipate to be
no earlier than the first quarter of 2000.  Accordingly, absent significant
increases in sales, particularly with respect to microprocessors, we will
continue to experience pressure on our gross margin percentage.  Gross margin
percentage of 23 percent in the second quarter of 1999 decreased from 26 percent
in the same quarter of 1998.  This decrease was primarily due to higher fixed
costs as a result of continued investment in Fab 25. Gross margin percentage of
26 percent in the first half of 1999 increased from 24 percent in the first half
of 1998, due to higher net sales of microprocessors.

                                       18
<PAGE>

Research and development expenses of $167 million in the second quarter of 1999
increased four percent compared to the first quarter of 1999.  Increased costs
related to the facilitization of Dresden Fab 30 and research and development
activities for the AMD Athlon microprocessor were partially offset by decreases
in expenses as a result of spending controls.  Research and development expenses
in the second quarter of 1999 increased 20 percent compared to the second
quarter of 1998 primarily due to increased costs for the facilitization of
Dresden Fab 30 and the 1998 alliance with Motorola for the development of Flash
memory and logic process technologies, which were partially offset by the
recognition of deferred credits in 1999 on foreign capital grants and interest
subsidies related to the costs of Dresden Fab 30. These credits of approximately
$13 million per quarter will continue to be offset against Dresden Fab 30
expenses in future quarters until June 2007. Beginning no earlier than the first
quarter of 2000, we expect Dresden Fab 30 to begin producing units for sale. At
that time, a significant portion of Dresden Fab 30 expenses, including the
deferred credits referred to above, will shift from research and development
expense to cost of sales. Research and development expenses of $327 million in
the first half of 1999 increased 22 percent compared to the first half of 1998
due to increased costs for the facilitization of Dresden Fab 30, the 1998
alliance with Motorola for the development of Flash memory and logic process
technologies and research and development activities for the AMD Athlon
microprocessor, which were partially offset by the recognition of deferred
credits in 1999 as discussed above as well as decreases in expenses resulting
from spending controls.

Marketing, general and administrative expenses of $125 million in the second
quarter of 1999 decreased two percent compared to the first quarter of 1999.
This was due to nonrecurring software charges incurred in the first quarter as
well as slightly lower spending on Year 2000 upgrade. These increases were
partially offset by costs incurred late in the quarter for introduction of the
AMD Athlon microprocessor. Marketing, general and administrative expenses in the
second quarter of 1999 increased 24 percent compared to the second quarter of
1998 primarily due to significantly higher marketing and promotional activities,
along with increased depreciation expense and costs associated with the
installation of new order management and accounts receivable systems. Marketing,
general and administrative expenses of $252 million in the first half of 1999
increased 33 percent compared to the first half of 1998 primarily due to
significantly higher marketing and promotional activities and increased
amortization expense and costs associated with the installation of new order
management and accounts receivable systems.

In the first quarter of the current fiscal year we initiated a review of our
cost structure. Based upon this review, we recorded restructuring and other
special charges of $18 million in the second quarter and $15 million in the
first quarter of 1999 as a result of certain of our actions to better align our
cost structure with expected revenue growth rates. Although we have achieved the
expected cost savings as a result of this realignment, we have not achieved the
expected revenue growth rates. As a result, we will continue to evaluate our
cost structure and expect to incur additional restructuring and other special
charges during the third quarter, and possibly the fourth quarter, of the
current fiscal year.

The restructuring activities and other special charges primarily relate to: 1)
the closure of a submicron development laboratory facility; 2) write-offs of
certain equipment, including estimated disposal costs, in the Submicron
Development Center (SDC); 3) write-offs of equipment utilized in the
discontinued 0.35-micron wafer fabrication process; 4) the elimination of job
responsibilities for 50 employees in the first quarter and 128 employees in the
second quarter in the SDC, sales offices and Information Technology department;
5) the write-off of

                                       19
<PAGE>

discontinued system projects; and 6) costs for vacated and unused sales office
leases. During the second quarter of 1999, we discharged our accrual balance of
$779 thousand which was incurred in the first quarter of 1999 relating to the
severance costs for the termination of 50 employees. We expect to discharge our
second quarter accrual balances as follows: 1) the $3.5 million accrual for SDC
equipment disposal costs is expected to be discharged by the first quarter of
2000; 2) the $1.7 million accrual for severance costs will be discharged during
the third quarter of the current fiscal year; and 3) the $968 thousand accrual
for costs related to vacated and unused sales office leases will be discharged
through the second quarter of 2002.

On June 15, 1999, we completed the sale of our Vantis segment to Lattice
Semiconductor Corporation for approximately $500 million in cash.  The actual
cash received was net of Vantis' cash and cash equivalent balance of
approximately $46 million at the closing.  Our pre-tax gain on the sale of
Vantis was $432 million, subject to adjustment, if any, based on the final
determination of the net asset value of Vantis at June 15, 1999.  The gain is
computed based on Vantis' net assets as of June 15, 1999 and other direct
expenses related to the sale.  The applicable tax rate on the gain was 40
percent.

A litigation settlement of approximately $12 million was recorded during the six
months ended June 28, 1998 for the settlement of a class action securities
lawsuit against AMD and certain current and former officers and directors.  We
paid the settlement during the third quarter of 1998.

Interest income and other, net of $7 million in the second quarter of 1999
decreased $4 million compared to the first quarter of 1999.  This decrease was
due primarily to a nonrecurring gain realized in the first quarter of 1999
related to the sale of an investment.  Interest income and other, net decreased
$1 million compared to the second quarter of 1998.  This decrease was mainly due
to lower average cash balances.  Interest income and other, net of $18 million
in the first half of 1999 increased $4 million compared to the first half of
1998.  This increase was primarily due to the gain on the sale of an investment.

Interest expense of $18 million in the second quarter of 1999 decreased $3
million compared to the first quarter of 1999.  This decrease was primarily due
to a higher amount of interest that was capitalized rather than expensed.
Interest expense remained flat compared to the same quarter in the previous
year.  Interest expense of $39 million in the first half of 1999 increased $9
million compared to the first half of 1998.  This increase was a result of
higher average debt balances, including the $517.5 million of Convertible
Subordinated Notes sold in May 1998 (the Convertible Subordinated Notes),
partially offset by higher capitalized interest.

Income Tax

We recorded an income tax provision of $172.8 million in the second quarter of
1999 and a tax benefit of $44.1 million in the second quarter of 1998.
Excluding the gain on the sale of Vantis and restructuring and other special
charges, the effective tax rate for the quarter and six months ended June 27,
1999 is zero percent, and effective tax benefit rate for the quarter and six
months

                                       20
<PAGE>

ended June 28, 1998 is 39 percent. The tax provision recorded in the second
quarter of 1999 is attributable to the gain on the sale of the Vantis
subsidiary. No tax benefits were recorded for the operating losses in the
quarter and six months ended June 27, 1999 because the deferred tax assets
arising from such losses are offset by a valuation allowance. The effective tax
rate is expected to be zero for the remainder of 1999.

We had net deferred tax liabilities of  $10.3 million as of June 27, 1999
representing certain foreign deferred taxes.

Other Items

International sales as a percent of net sales were 58 percent in both the second
quarter of 1999 and the first quarter of 1999, and 48 percent in the second
quarter of 1998.  International sales were 58 percent of net sales in the first
half of 1999 and 52 percent of net sales in the first half of 1998.  During the
first half of 1999, approximately nine percent of our net sales were denominated
in foreign currencies.  We do not have sales denominated in local currencies in
those countries which have highly inflationary economies (as defined by
generally accepted accounting principles).  The impact on our operating results
from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not
been material.

sales by product group.

On June 15, 1999, we completed the sale of our Vantis segment to Lattice
Semiconductor Corporation for approximately $500 million in cash.  The actual
cash received of approximately $454 million was net of Vantis' cash and cash
equivalent balance of approximately $46 million as of the closing.

The following is a summary of operating income (loss) by segment for the periods
presented below:

</TABLE>

The AMD segment incurred a larger operating loss in the second quarter of 1999
compared to the first quarter of 1999 due to a decrease in net sales of the AMD
segment, primarily as a result of aggressive Intel marketing, pricing and
product bundling. While net sales decreased, cost of sales remained high, and
research and development costs and restructuring and other special charges
increased. The AMD segment's operating loss increased in the second quarter of
1999 compared to the same quarter in 1998, and in the first half of 1999
compared to the first half of 1998, despite higher net sales. These operating
loss increases were caused by higher costs associated

                                       21
<PAGE>

with the facilitization of Fab 25 and Dresden Fab 30, the alliance with
Motorola, research and development on the AMD Athlon microprocessor,
restructuring and other special charges and depreciation on the new order
management and accounts receivable systems.

Net sales for the Vantis segment decreased for all periods presented due to the
sale of the Vantis segment on June 15, 1999, which created a fewer number of
weeks included in the quarter and six months ended June 27, 1999.  The Vantis
segment incurred an operating loss in the second quarter of 1999 compared to
operating income in the first quarter of 1999 due to lower net sales in the
Vantis segment, higher research and development expenses and higher marketing,
general and administrative expenses.  Research and development expenses were
higher as a result of increased work on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
products.  Marketing, general and administrative expenses increased due to
various employee bonus plans.  The Vantis segment's operating income decreased
in the second quarter of 1999 compared to the same quarter in 1998.  This was
due to lower net sales and higher marketing, general and administrative expenses
resulting from employee incentive plans and the implementation of new order
management and accounts receivable systems.  The Vantis segment's operating
income decreased in the first half of 1999 compared to the first half of 1998
due to lower net sales along with higher marketing, general and administrative
expenses.  These expenses resulted from various employee incentive plans and
additional sales and marketing employees.



- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINANCIAL CONDITION

Cash and cash equivalents in the first half of 1999 decreased by $141 million
compared to a decrease of $80 million in the first half of 1998.  Year to date
capital expenditures in 1999 have been offset by cash received on the sale of
Vantis in the second quarter of 1999.  A portion of these cash proceeds were
used to pay down our debt holdings by $150 million in the current year.  By
comparison, capital expenditures in the first half of 1998 were financed
primarily through proceeds from borrowings and foreign grants.

Operating activities consumed $18 million in the first half of 1999 compared to
positive operating cash flows of $72 million in the first half of 1998.  The
cash used in current year operations is primarily due to our cumulative net loss
of $48 million which was partially offset by a decrease in net operating assets
of $42 million.  Depreciation expense, non-cash restructuring charges and other
non-cash adjustments of $446 million that would normally be added back to net
loss were offset by the gain on the sale of Vantis of $432 million and deferred
foreign grant and subsidy income of $25 million.

Net investing activities generated $4 million during the first half of 1999.
Proceeds from the sale of Vantis of $454 million more than offset current year
capital expenditures of $347 million.  This increase in cash was offset by the
investment of nearly $105 million in cash in short-term securities during the
first half of this year.  Investing activities used $788 million in the first
half of 1998, primarily due to $490 million of capital expenditures and $304
million of cash invested in short-term securities.

                                       22
<PAGE>

Financing activities consumed $116 million during the first half of 1999,
primarily as a result of debt payments of $150 million which were partially
offset by proceeds from borrowings and stock issuances. Financing activities in
the first half of 1998 generated $638 million mostly from the issuance of debt
and the receipt of foreign grants.

Our 1996 syndicated bank loan agreement (the Credit Agreement) provided for a
$150 million three-year secured revolving line of credit and a $250 million
four-year secured term loan. On June 25, 1999, we terminated the secured
revolving line of credit. Approximately $86 million of the four-year secured
term loan was outstanding as of June 27, 1999. As of June 27, 1999, we were in
compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement. In July 1999, we
repaid the outstanding balance on the secured term loan, terminated the Credit
Agreement and refinanced the Credit Agreement with a new Loan and Security
Agreement (the Loan Agreement) with a consortium of banks led by Bank of
America. Under the Loan Agreement, which provides for a four-year secured
revolving line of credit of up to $200 million, we can borrow up to 85 percent
of our eligible accounts receivable from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)
and 50 percent of our eligible accounts receivable from distributors, subject to
reserves which may be set aside by the lenders. AMD will be subject to
compliance with certain financial covenants if the levels of domestic cash it
holds declines to certain levels, or the amount of borrowings under the Loan
Agreement rises to certain levels. Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are
secured by a pledge of most of our accounts receivable, inventory, general
intangibles and the related proceeds.

As of June 27, 1999, we had available unsecured uncommitted bank lines of credit
in the amount of $68 million, of which $6 million was outstanding.

We plan to continue to make significant capital investments throughout the
remainder of 1999. These investments include those relating to the continued
facilitization of Dresden Fab 30 and Fab 25.

AMD Saxony Manufacturing GmbH (AMD Saxony), an indirect wholly owned German
subsidiary of AMD, has constructed and is installing equipment in Dresden Fab
30, a 900,000-square-foot submicron integrated circuit manufacturing and design
facility located in Dresden, in the State of Saxony, Germany. AMD, the Federal
Republic of Germany, the State of Saxony and a consortium of banks are
supporting the project. We currently estimate construction and facilitization
costs of Dresden Fab 30 to be $1.8 billion. In March 1997, AMD Saxony entered
into a loan agreement and other related agreements (the Dresden Loan Agreements)
with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG. The Dresden Loan Agreements
provide for the funding of the construction and facilitization of Dresden Fab
30. The funding consists of:

     .  equity, subordinated loans and loan guarantees from AMD;
     .  loans from a consortium of banks; and
     .  grants, subsidies and loan guarantees from the Federal Republic of
        Germany and the State of Saxony.

The Dresden Loan Agreements, which were amended in February 1998 to reflect
planned upgrades in wafer production technology as well as the decline in the
deutsche mark relative to the U.S. dollar, require that we partially fund
Dresden Fab 30 project costs in the form of subordinated loans to, or equity
investments in, AMD Saxony. In accordance with the terms of the Dresden Loan
Agreements, we have invested $286 million to date (most of which is

                                       23
<PAGE>

denominated in deutsche marks) in the form of subordinated loans and equity in
AMD Saxony. We amended the Dresden Loan Agreements in June 1999 to remove a
requirement that we sell at least $200 million of our stock by June 30, 1999 in
order to fund a $70 million loan to AMD Saxony. In lieu of the stock offering,
we funded the $70 million loan to AMD Saxony with proceeds from the sale of
Vantis. We are required to make additional subordinated loans to, or equity
investments in, AMD Saxony of $100 million before December 31, 1999.

Additionally, the consortium of banks referred to above has made available $871
million in loans (denominated in deutsche marks) to AMD Saxony to help fund
Dresden Fab 30 project costs. AMD Saxony had $264 million of such loans
outstanding as of June 27, 1999.

Finally, the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Saxony are supporting
the Dresden Fab 30 project, in accordance with the Dresden Loan Agreements, in
the form of:

     .  guarantees of 65 percent of AMD Saxony bank debt up to a maximum amount
        of $871 million;
     .  capital investment grants and allowances totaling $287 million; and
     .  interest subsidies totaling $159 million.

Of these amounts (which are all denominated in deutsche marks), AMD Saxony had
received $275 million in capital investment grants and $15 million in interest
subsidies as of June 27, 1999. The grants and subsidies are subject to
conditions, including meeting specified levels of employment in December 2001
and maintaining those levels until June 2007. Noncompliance with the conditions
of the grants and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion
of the future amounts to be received as well as the repayment of all or a
portion of amounts received to date. As of June 27, 1999, we were in compliance
with all of the conditions of the grants and subsidies.

The Dresden Loan Agreements also require that we:

     .  provide interim funding to AMD Saxony if either the remaining capital
        investment allowances or the remaining interest subsidies are delayed,
        such funding to be repaid to AMD as AMD Saxony receives the grants or
        subsidies from the State of Saxony;
     .  fund shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any default under
        the subsidy agreements caused by AMD Saxony or its affiliates;
     .  guarantee a portion of AMD Saxony's obligations under the Dresden Loan
        Agreements up to a maximum of $115 million (denominated in deutsche
        marks) until Dresden Fab 30 has been completed;
     .  fund certain contingent obligations including obligations to fund
        project cost overruns, if any; and
     .  make funds available to AMD Saxony, after completion of Dresden Fab 30,
        up to approximately $77 million (denominated in deutsche marks) if AMD
        Saxony does not meet its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant.

Because our obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements are denominated in
deutsche marks, the dollar amounts set forth above are subject to change based
on applicable conversion rates. We used the exchange rate at the end of the
second quarter of 1999, which was

                                       24
<PAGE>

approximately 1.89 deutsche marks to 1 U.S. dollar, to value our obligations
denominated in deutsche marks.

The definition of defaults under the Dresden Loan Agreements includes the
failure of AMD, AMD Saxony or AMD Saxony Holding GmbH (AMD Holding), the parent
company of AMD Saxony and a wholly owned subsidiary of AMD, to comply with
obligations in connection with the Dresden Loan Agreements, including:

     .  material variances from the approved schedule and budget;
     .  our failure to fund equity contributions or shareholder loans or
        otherwise comply with our obligations relating to the Dresden Loan
        Agreements;
     .  the sale of shares in AMD Saxony or AMD Holding;
     .  the failure to pay material obligations;
     .  the occurrence of a material adverse change or filings or proceedings in
        bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, AMD Saxony or AMD Holding;
        and
     .  the occurrence of default under the indenture dated August 1, 1996
        between AMD and the United States Trust Company of New York (the
        Indenture) pursuant to which our $400 million aggregate principal amount
        of 11% Senior Secured Notes due 2003 (the Senior Secured Notes) were
        issued or the Loan Agreement.

Generally, any such default which either (1) results from our non-compliance
with AMD obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements and is not cured by AMD
or (2) results in recourse to AMD of more than $2.5 million and is not cured by
AMD, would result in a cross-default under the Dresden Loan Agreements, the
Indenture and the Loan Agreement. Under certain circumstances, cross-defaults
result under the Convertible Subordinated Notes, the Indenture, and the Dresden
Loan Agreements.

In the event we are unable to meet our obligation to make loans to, or equity
investments in, AMD Saxony as required under the Dresden Loan Agreements, AMD
Saxony will be unable to complete Dresden Fab 30 and we will be in default under
the Dresden Loan Agreements, the Indenture and the Loan Agreement, which would
permit acceleration of certain indebtedness, which would have a material adverse
effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain
the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations. Any such failure would have a
material adverse effect on our business.

FASL, a joint venture formed by AMD and Fujitsu Limited in 1993, is continuing
the facilitization of its second Flash memory device wafer fabrication facility,
FASL II, in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan. We expect the facility, including equipment,
to cost approximately $1 billion when fully equipped. As of June 27, 1999,
approximately $394 million of this cost had been funded. Capital expenditures
for FASL II construction to date have been funded by cash generated from FASL
operations and local borrowings by FASL. We currently anticipate that during
1999, FASL capital expenditures will continue to be funded by cash generated
from FASL operations and local borrowings by FASL. However, to the extent that
FASL is unable to secure the necessary funds for FASL II, we may be required to
contribute cash or guarantee third-party loans in proportion to our 49.992
percent interest in FASL. As of June 27, 1999, we had loan guarantees of $47
million outstanding with respect to these loans. The planned FASL II costs are

                                       25
<PAGE>

denominated in yen and are, therefore, subject to change due to foreign exchange
rate fluctuations.

We believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances, together
with external financing activities, will be sufficient to fund operations and
capital investments through the next twelve months.

RISK FACTORS

Our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to a
number of risk factors, including the following:

Microprocessor Products

Future Dependence on AMD Athlon Microprocessor. We will need to successfully
market our seventh-generation microprocessor, the AMD Athlon microprocessor, in
order to increase our microprocessor product revenues in 1999 and beyond, and to
benefit fully from the substantial financial investments and commitments we have
made and continue to make related to microprocessors. We commenced initial
shipments of the AMD Athlon microprocessor in June 1999. Our production and
sales plans for the AMD Athlon microprocessor are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties, including:

     .  our ability to produce the AMD Athlon microprocessor in the volume
        required by customers on a timely basis;
     .  the availability and acceptance of motherboards and chipsets designed
        for the AMD Athlon microprocessor;
     .  market acceptance of the AMD Athlon microprocessor;
     .  our ability to maintain average selling prices of the AMD Athlon
        microprocessor despite Intel marketing, pricing and bundling activities
        or deterioration of market conditions or customer relationships which
        affect market demand;
     .  the successful development and installation of 0.18-micron process
        technology and copper interconnect technology;
     .  the pace at which we are able to transition production in Fab 25 from
        0.25 to 0.18-micron process technology and to ramp production in Dresden
        Fab 30 on 0.18-micron copper interconnect process technology;
     .  the use and market acceptance of a non-Intel processor bus (adapted by
        us from Digital Equipment Corporation's EV6 pin bus) in the design of
        the AMD Athlon microprocessor, and the availability of chipset vendors
        who will develop, manufacture and sell chipsets with the EV6 interface
        in volumes required by us;
     .  our ability to expand our chipset and system design capabilities;
     .  the availability to our customers of cost and performance competitive
        Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs) (including Tag chips) if Intel
        corners the market for SRAM production capacity through its relationship
        with SRAM manufacturers; and
     .  our ability to design and manufacture processor modules through
        subcontractors.

If we fail to achieve market acceptance of the AMD Athlon microprocessor, our
business will be materially and adversely affected.

                                       26
<PAGE>

Investment in and Dependence on K86(TM) AMD Microprocessor Products. Our
microprocessor product revenues have significantly impacted, and will continue
in 1999 and 2000 to significantly impact, our revenues, profit margins and
operating results. We plan to continue to make significant capital expenditures
to support our microprocessor products both in the near and long term. These
capital expenditures will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and cash
balances.

Our ability to increase microprocessor product revenues, and benefit fully from
the substantial financial investments and commitments we have made and continue
to make related to microprocessors, depends upon the success of the AMD Athlon
microprocessor, which is our seventh-generation Microsoft Windows compatible
microprocessor, the AMD-K6-2 and AMD-K6-III microprocessors with 3DNow!(TM)
technology (the AMD-K6 family of microprocessors or the AMD-K6 microprocessors),
and the future generations of K86 microprocessors. The microprocessor market is
characterized by short product life cycles and migration to ever-higher
performance microprocessors. To compete successfully against Intel in this
market, we must transition to new process technologies at a faster pace than
before and offer higher performance microprocessors in significantly greater
volumes. We must achieve acceptable yields while producing microprocessors at
higher speeds. In the past, we have experienced significant difficulty in
achieving microprocessor yield and volume plans. Such difficulties have in the
past, and may in the future, adversely affect our results of operations and
liquidity. If we fail to offer higher performance microprocessors in significant
volume on a timely basis in the future, our business could be materially and
adversely affected. We may not achieve the production ramp necessary to meet our
customers' volume requirements for higher performance AMD Athlon and AMD-K6
microprocessors. It is also possible that we may not increase our microprocessor
revenues enough to achieve sustained profitability.

To sell the volume of AMD Athlon and AMD-K6 microprocessors we currently plan to
make in 1999 and 2000, we must increase sales to existing customers and develop
new customers. If we lose any current top tier OEM customer, or if we fail to
attract additional customers through direct sales and through our distributors,
we may not be able to sell the volume of units planned. This result could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

Our production and sales plans for the AMD Athlon and AMD-K6 microprocessors are
subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:

     .  market acceptance of the AMD Athlon microprocessor, including the timely
        availability of motherboards and chipsets designed for this processor;
     .  whether we can successfully fabricate higher performance AMD Athlon and
        AMD-K6 microprocessors in planned volume mixes;
     .  the effects of Intel's new product introductions, marketing strategies
        and pricing;
     .  the continued development of worldwide market acceptance for the AMD-K6
        microprocessors and systems based on them;
     .  whether we will have the financial and other resources necessary to
        continue to invest in the microprocessor products, including leading-
        edge wafer fabrication equipment and advanced process technologies;
     .  the possibility that our newly introduced products may be defective;
     .  adverse market conditions in the personal computer (PC) market and
        consequent diminished demand for our microprocessors; and

                                       27
<PAGE>

     .  unexpected interruptions in our manufacturing operations.

Because Intel dominates the industry and has brand strength, we have in the past
priced the AMD-K6 microprocessors below the published price of Intel processors
offering comparable performance. Thus, Intel's decisions on processor prices can
impact and have impacted the average selling prices of the AMD-K6
microprocessors, and consequently can impact and have impacted our margins. Our
business could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to:

     .  achieve the product performance improvements necessary to meet customer
        needs;
     .  continue to achieve market acceptance of our AMD-K6 microprocessors and
        increase market share;
     .  substantially increase revenues of the AMD-K6 family of microprocessors;
        and
     .  successfully ramp production and sales of the AMD Athlon microprocessor.

See also discussions below regarding Intel Dominance and Process Technology.

Intel Dominance. Intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in PCs
for a long time. Because of its dominant market position, Intel sets and
controls x86 microprocessor and PC system standards and, thus, dictates the type
of product the market requires of Intel's competitors. In addition, Intel can
vary prices on its microprocessors and other products at will and thereby affect
the margins and profitability of its competitors due to its financial strength
and dominant position. Intel exerts substantial influence over PC manufacturers
and their channels of distribution through the Intel Inside advertising rebate
program and other marketing programs. Intel invests hundreds of millions of
dollars in, and as a result exerts influence over, many other technology
companies. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in research and
development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies, and to
remain dominant:

     .  through the Intel Inside and other marketing programs;
     .  through other contractual constraints on customers, retailers, industry
        suppliers and other third parties;
     .  by controlling industry standards; and
     .  by controlling supply and demand of motherboards, chipsets and other
        system components.

As an extension of its dominant microprocessor market share, Intel also now
dominates the PC platform. As a result, it is difficult for PC manufacturers to
innovate and differentiate their product offerings. We do not have the financial
resources to compete with Intel on such a large scale. As long as Intel remains
in this dominant position, we may be materially and adversely affected by its:

     .  product mix and introduction schedules;
     .  product bundling and pricing strategies;
     .  control over industry standards, PC manufacturers and other PC industry
        participants, including motherboard, chipset and BIOS suppliers; and
     .  customer brand loyalty.

As Intel has expanded its dominance over the PC system platform, many PC
manufacturers have reduced their system development expenditures and have
purchased microprocessors in conjunction with chipsets or in assembled
motherboards. PC OEMs have become increasingly dependent on Intel, less
innovative on their own and more of a distribution channel for Intel

                                       28
<PAGE>

technology. In marketing our microprocessors to these OEMs and dealers, we
depend on companies other than Intel for the design and manufacture of core-
logic chipsets, motherboards, basic input/output system (BIOS) software and
other components. In recent years, these third-party designers and manufacturers
have lost significant market share to Intel. In addition, these companies
produce chipsets, motherboards, BIOS software and other components to support
each new generation of Intel's microprocessors only if Intel makes information
about its products available to them in time to address market opportunities.
Delay in the availability of such information makes, and will continue to make,
it increasingly difficult for these third parties to retain or regain market
share.

To compete with Intel in the microprocessor market in the future, we intend to
continue to form closer relationships with third-party designers and
manufacturers of core-logic chipsets, motherboards, BIOS software and other
components. Similarly, we intend to expand our chipset and system design
capabilities, and to offer OEMs licensed system designs incorporating our
microprocessors and companion products. We cannot be certain, however, that our
efforts will be successful. We expect that, as Intel introduces future
generations of microprocessors, chipsets and motherboards, the design of
chipsets, memory and other semiconductor devices, and higher level board
products which support Intel microprocessors, will become increasingly dependent
on the Intel microprocessor design and may become incompatible with non-Intel
processor-based PC systems.

Intel's Pentium(R) II, III and Celeron(TM) microprocessors are sold only in form
factors that are not physically or interface protocol compatible with "Socket 7"
motherboards currently used with AMD-K6 microprocessors. Thus, Intel no longer
supports the Socket 7 infrastructure as it has transitioned away from its
Pentium processors. Because the AMD-K6 microprocessors are designed to be Socket
7 compatible, and will not work with motherboards designed for Pentium II, III
and Celeron processors, we intend to continue to work with third-party designers
and manufacturers of motherboards, chipsets and other products to ensure the
continued availability of Socket 7 infrastructure support for the AMD-K6
microprocessors, including support for enhancements and features we add to our
microprocessors. Socket 7 infrastructure support for the AMD-K6 microprocessors
may not endure over time as Intel moves the market to its infrastructure
choices. We do not currently plan to develop microprocessors that are bus
interface protocol compatible with the Pentium II, Pentium III and Celeron
processors because our patent cross-license agreement with Intel does not extend
to microprocessors that are bus interface protocol compatible with Intel's sixth
and subsequent generation processors. Thus, the AMD Athlon microprocessor card
is not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with
Intel microprocessors. Our ability to compete with Intel in the market for AMD
Athlon seventh-generation and future generation microprocessors will depend on
our:

     .  success in designing and developing the microprocessors; and
     .  ability to ensure that the microprocessors can be used in PC platforms
        designed to support Intel's microprocessors and our microprocessors, or
        that alternative platforms are available which are competitive with
        those used with Intel processors.

A failure for any reason of the designers and producers of motherboards,
chipsets and other system components to support our K86 microprocessor offerings
would have a material adverse effect on our business.

                                       29

Dependence on Microsoft and Logo License. Our ability to innovate beyond the x86
instruction set controlled by Intel depends on support from Microsoft in its
operating systems. If Microsoft does not provide support in its operating
systems for the x86 instructions that we innovate and design into our
processors, independent software providers may forego designing their software
applications to take advantage of our innovations. This would adversely affect
our ability to market our processors. In addition, we have entered into logo
license agreements with Microsoft that allow us to label our products as
"Designed for Microsoft Windows." We have also obtained appropriate
certifications from recognized testing organizations for our K86
microprocessors. If we fail to maintain the logo license agreements with
Microsoft, we may lose our ability to label our K86 microprocessors with the
Microsoft Windows logo. This could impair our ability to market the products and
could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Fluctuations in PC Market. Since most of our microprocessor products are used in
PCs and related peripherals, our future growth is closely tied to the
performance of the PC industry. Industry-wide fluctuations in the PC marketplace
have in the past and may in the future materially and adversely affect our
business.

Financing Requirements

We plan to continue to make significant capital investments in 1999. These
investments include those relating to the continued facilitization of Dresden
Fab 30 and Fab 25.

In 1998, equipment was installed and production was initiated in FASL II. We
expect the facility, including equipment, to cost approximately $1 billion when
fully equipped. Capital expenditures for FASL II construction to date have been
funded by cash generated from FASL operations and borrowings by FASL. If FASL is
unable to secure the necessary funds for FASL II, we may be required to
contribute cash or guarantee third-party loans in proportion to our 49.992
percent interest in FASL.

In 1996, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which provided for a $150 million
three-year secured revolving line of credit and a $250 million four-year secured
term loan. Approximately $86 million of the secured term loan was outstanding as
of June 27, 1999. On June 25, 1999, we terminated the secured revolving line of
credit. In July 1999, we repaid the outstanding balance on the secured term
loan, terminated the Credit Agreement and replaced the Credit Agreement with the
Loan Agreement. Under the Loan Agreement, which provides for a four-year secured
revolving line of credit of up to $200 million, we can borrow up to 85 percent
of our eligible accounts receivable from OEMs and 50 percent of our eligible
accounts receivable from distributors, subject to reserves which may be set
aside by the lenders. AMD will be subject to compliance with certain financial
covenants if the levels of domestic cash it holds declines to certain levels,
or the amount of borrowings under the Loan Agreement rises to certain levels.
Our obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a pledge of most of our
accounts receivable, inventory, general intangibles and the related proceeds.

In March 1997, our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, AMD Saxony, entered the
Dresden Loan Agreements with a consortium of banks led by Dresdner Bank AG. The
terms of the Dresden Loan Agreements required us to make subordinated loans to
AMD Saxony totaling $100 million in 1998. The Dresden Loan Agreements, which
were amended in February 1998 to reflect planned upgrades in wafer production
technology as well as the decline in the deutsche mark

                                       30
<PAGE>

relative to the U.S. dollar, require that we partially fund Dresden Fab 30
project costs in the form of subordinated loans to, or equity investments in,
AMD Saxony. In accordance with the terms of the Dresden Loan Agreements, we have
invested $286 million to date in the form of subordinated loans and equity in
AMD Saxony. We amended the Dresden Loan Agreements in June 1999 to remove a
requirement that we sell at least $200 million of our stock by June 30, 1999 in
order to fund a $70 million loan to AMD Saxony. In lieu of the stock offering,
we funded the $70 million loan to AMD Saxony with proceeds from the sale of
Vantis. We are required to make additional subordinated loans to, or equity
investments in, AMD Saxony of $100 million before December 31, 1999.

Because our obligations under the Dresden Loan Agreements are denominated in
deutsche marks, the dollar amounts set forth herein are subject to change based
on applicable conversion rates. As of the end of the second quarter of 1999, the
exchange rate was approximately 1.89 deutsche marks to 1 U.S. dollar (which we
used to calculate our obligations denominated in deutsche marks).

If we are unable to meet our obligation to make loans to, or equity investments
in, AMD Saxony as required under the Dresden Loan Agreements, AMD Saxony will be
unable to complete Dresden Fab 30 and we will be in default under the Dresden
Loan Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the Indenture, which would permit
acceleration of indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our
business. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these
obligations, our business will be materially and adversely affected.

Manufacturing

Capacity. We underutilize our manufacturing facilities from time to time as a
result of reduced demand for certain of our products. Our operations related to
microprocessors have been particularly affected by this situation. If we
underutilize our manufacturing facilities in the future, our revenues may
suffer. We are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by making
significant capital investments in Fab 25 and Dresden Fab 30. In addition, the
building construction of FASL II, a second Flash memory device manufacturing
facility, is complete and equipment installation is in progress. We have also
built a new test and assembly facility in Suzhou, China. We are basing our
strategy of increasing our manufacturing capacity on industry projections for
future growth. If these industry projections are inaccurate and demand for our
products does not increase, we will likely underutilize our manufacturing
facilities and our business could be materially and adversely affected.

In contrast to the above, there also have been situations in the past in which
our manufacturing facilities were inadequate to meet the demand for certain of
our products. Our inability to generate sufficient manufacturing capacities to
meet demand, either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar
arrangements with others, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
At this time, the risk is that we will have insufficient capacity to meet demand
for Flash memory products and significant capacity relative to demand for our
microprocessor offerings.

Process Technology. In order to remain competitive, we must make continuing
substantial investments in improving our process technologies. In particular, we
have made and continue to make significant research and development investments
in the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our microprocessor products
and our Flash memory devices. Portions of these

                                       31
<PAGE>

investments might not be fully recovered if we fail to continue to gain market
acceptance or if the market for our Flash memory products should significantly
deteriorate. Likewise, we are making a substantial investment in Dresden Fab 30.
The business plan for Dresden Fab 30 calls for the successful development and
installation of 0.18-micron process technology and copper interconnect
technology in order to manufacture the AMD Athlon microprocessor in Dresden Fab
30. We have entered into a strategic alliance with Motorola to co-develop the
copper interconnect technology required for the AMD Athlon microprocessor and
subsequent generations of microprocessors. We cannot be certain that the
strategic alliance will be successful or that we will be able to develop or
obtain the leading-edge process technologies that will be required in Fab 25 or
Dresden Fab 30 to fabricate the AMD Athlon microprocessor successfully.

Manufacturing Interruptions and Yields. Any substantial interruption of our
manufacturing operations, either as a result of a labor dispute, equipment
failure or other cause, could materially and adversely affect our business
operations. We also have been and may in the future be materially and adversely
affected by fluctuations in manufacturing yields. For example, our results in
the past have been negatively affected by disappointing AMD-K6 microprocessor
yields. The design and manufacture of ICs is a complex process. Normal
manufacturing risks include errors and interruptions in the fabrication process
and defects in raw materials, as well as other risks, all of which can affect
yields. Additional manufacturing risks incurred in ramping up new fabrication
areas and/or new manufacturing processes include equipment performance and
process controls as well as other risks, all of which can affect yields.

Product Incompatibility. Our products may possibly be incompatible with some or
all industry-standard software and hardware. If our customers are unable to
achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products is shipped in
volume, we could be materially adversely affected. It is also possible that we
may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems that are
discovered or that corrections will be unacceptable to customers or made in an
untimely manner. In addition, the mere announcement of an incompatibility
problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Product Defects. One or more of our products may possibly be found to be
defective after we have already shipped such products in volume, requiring a
product replacement, recall, or a software fix which would cure such defect but
impede performance. We may also be subject to product returns which could impose
substantial costs on us and have a material and adverse effect our business.

Essential Manufacturing Materials. Certain raw materials we use in the
manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers.
For example, a few foreign companies principally supply several types of the IC
packages purchased by us, as well as by the majority of other companies in the
semiconductor industry. Interruption of supply or increased demand in the
industry could cause shortages in various essential materials. We would have to
reduce our manufacturing operations if we were unable to procure certain of
these materials. This reduction in our manufacturing operations could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

International Manufacturing and Foundries. Nearly all product assembly and final
testing of our products are performed at our manufacturing facilities in Penang,
Malaysia; Bangkok, Thailand; and Singapore; or by subcontractors in Asia. We
have also constructed an additional assembly

                                       32
<PAGE>

and test facility in Suzhou, China. We also depend on foreign foundry suppliers
and joint ventures for the manufacture of a portion of our finished silicon
wafers. Foreign manufacturing and construction of foreign facilities entail
political and economic risks, including political instability, expropriation,
currency controls and fluctuations, changes in freight and interest rates, and
loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs. For example, if we
were unable to assemble and test our products abroad, or if air transportation
between the United States and our overseas facilities were disrupted, there
could be a material adverse effect on our business.

Impact of Year 2000

General. The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer software and firmware
being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year.
If our computer software and firmware with date-sensitive functions are not Year
2000 capable, they may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than
the year 2000. This could result in a system failure or miscalculations causing
disruptions of operations, including, among other things, interruptions in
manufacturing operations or in the ability to process transactions, send
invoices or engage in other normal business activities.

Our multi-step Year 2000 readiness plan includes development of corporate
awareness, assessment of internal systems, project planning, project
implementation (including remediation, upgrading and replacement), validation
testing and contingency planning for both information technology (IT) and non-IT
internal systems.

The Plan. Our plan covers four areas that are critical to our business
operations:

     .  Information Technology, which includes application software,
        infrastructure and network engineering and telecommunications;
     .  Manufacturing, which includes wafer fabrication facilities, assembly and
        test facilities and third-party foundries;
     .  Products and product design, which includes our commercial products and
        the hardware and software tools used specifically for product design;
        and
     .  Organizational support, which includes non-fabrication facilities,
        security, corporate supply management, shipping, quality and
        environmental health and safety (EHS) departments.

 . Information Technology. We have modified or replaced significant portions of
our application software so that our systems will function properly with respect
to dates in the year 2000 and thereafter. Application software consists of
business software required for our corporate business systems, including our
accounts payable and receivable, payroll, order management, general ledger and
shipping applications. In December 1998, we installed new Year 2000 capable
order management and accounts receivable systems. As of June 27, 1999, we
completed remediation of all core business software that did not require an
upgrade or a replacement. A few other core business related software programs
still require upgrades. We plan to continue to test our application software
through the end of the third quarter of 1999. Our goal is to complete testing
and put all application systems into production by September 30, 1999. If
required modifications to existing software are not made, or are not completed
in a timely manner, the Year 2000 issue could have a material impact on our
business.

                                       33
<PAGE>

IT infrastructure consists of hardware and software other than application
software that supports our mainframe and distributed computer systems, including
PCs, operating systems and system utilities.  We have tested Year 2000 capable
versions of all our infrastructure software and are in the process of
transitioning such software into productive use. Approximately 99 percent of our
Year 2000 capable infrastructure hardware and software was installed and in
production as of June 27, 1999.  Our goal is for the remaining one percent to be
completed by September 30, 1999.  If we are unable to successfully transition
our infrastructure software or to install and put our infrastructure hardware
and software into production as anticipated, our business could be materially
and adversely affected.

Network engineering and telecommunications consists of components in our data
and voice communication networks.  All of the data components and the voice
components in our communication networks were Year 2000 capable as of June 27,
1999.  However, we do not currently have all of the information necessary to
determine if certain of our international network service providers will be Year
2000 capable in a timely manner.  If they are not Year 2000 capable, our
business could be materially and adversely affected.

 .  Manufacturing.  We are dedicating substantial resources to Year 2000 issues
with respect to our wafer fabrication facilities worldwide to ensure continued
operation of all critical wafer fabrication systems in the year 2000 and
thereafter.  We have retained an outside firm to provide Year 2000 program
management and implementation assistance in connection with problem assessment,
remediation and compliance testing.  Approximately 90 percent of the critical
wafer fabrication equipment was made Year 2000 capable as of June 27, 1999.  It
is our goal that 99 percent of the wafer fabrication equipment will be
Year 2000 capable by September 30, 1999 and the remaining one percent of the
equipment will be Year 2000 capable by year-end 1999. Fabrication equipment
software testing and installation is ongoing and will continue through the
fourth quarter of 1999. Some vendors have indicated that Year 2000 capable
upgrades will not be available until late 1999. If these vendors do not provide
Year 2000 capable upgrades in time for us to install the products and to do
adequate testing, or if the products do not adequately address the Year 2000
problem, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

Our assembly and test facilities are located in Malaysia, Thailand, China and
Singapore. The remediation and replacement process for noncompliant systems and
equipment in these facilities was 99 percent complete as of June 27, 1999. Our
goal is to complete this remediation by September 30, 1999.

We believe that all critical Year 2000-related manufacturing areas, including
our wafer fabrication facilities and assembly and test facilities, will be Year
2000 capable by year-end 1999.  We have begun contingency planning for critical
areas of our wafer manufacturing facilities and will continue developing and
refining these plans throughout 1999.

However, we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in our efforts
to resolve any Year 2000 issues and to continue operations in our wafer
fabrication facilities in the year 2000.  Our failure to successfully resolve
such issues could result in a shutdown of some or all of our operations, which
would have a material adverse effect on our business.

                                       34
<PAGE>

 .  Products and Product Design. We have reviewed the status of our current
products and have not identified any critical products with Year 2000 problems.
We believe that the critical hardware and software we use for product design
will be Year 2000 capable as of September 30, 1999. Testing of these systems is
ongoing and will continue through the end of the year. If we fail to make the
hardware and software we use for product design Year 2000 capable by year-end
1999, our business could be materially and adversely affected.

 .  Organizational Support. Since organizational support consists of several
functional divisions that provide administrative support to us as a whole, and
this support overlaps in many areas, we are unable to quantify the overall
progress of this group. However, some divisions have commenced significant
projects aimed at Year 2000 readiness. For example, the facilities department is
in the process of upgrading the building management system at our corporate
marketing, general and administrative facility located in Sunnyvale, California.
As of June 27, 1999, we had installed all software upgrades required by
facilities for Year 2000 readiness. EHS provides another example. Upgrades are
being scheduled and performed on gas detection systems, acid neutralization
systems and groundwater cleanup controls. EHS' critical Year 2000 readiness
activities were complete as of June 27, 1999. Similarly, our security department
has completed our plan to ensure Year 2000 compliance of the fire, intrusion and
industrial process alarms in our China, Thailand and Germany sites. Our goal is
to have our domestic alarm systems upgraded and tested for Year 2000 compliance
by September 30, 1999, and to have all remaining alarm system upgrades and
testing complete by October 31, 1999. In addition to upgrades, these
organizational support divisions have replaced and will continue to replace
equipment and systems to the extent it is required for our Year 2000 readiness.
However, if we are unable to make our organizational support systems Year 2000
capable before year-end 1999, our business could be materially and adversely
affected.

Third-Party Suppliers and Customers. We have initiated communication with our
significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which our
operations are vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own
Year 2000 issues. Suppliers of hardware, software or products that might contain
embedded processors were asked to provide information regarding the Year 2000
compliance status of their products. We have also contacted critical materials
and services suppliers in the first and second quarters of 1999. We will
continue to seek information from non-responsive suppliers in the third quarter
of 1999. In addition, in order to protect against the acquisition of additional
non-compliant products, we now require suppliers to warrant that products sold
or licensed to us are Year 2000 capable. We are currently assessing our
significant customers' Year 2000 readiness plans. In the event that any of our
significant customers and suppliers do not successfully and timely achieve Year
2000 compliance, our business or operations could be adversely affected. We
cannot give any assurance that the systems of other companies on which our
systems rely will be converted in a timely manner and will not have an adverse
effect on our operations. We are currently assessing the extent to which our
significant customers' exposure to contingencies related to the Year 2000 will
affect the products we sell; however, we do not expect these to have a material
impact on our operations.

Overall our goal is to resolve our remaining critical Year 2000 issues by
September 30, 1999, which is prior to any anticipated impact on our operating
systems. We expect some testing and verification activities, as well as some
upgrading of the wafer fabrication equipment, to continue through the end of the
year. We also expect some aspects of the Year 2000 plan to continue beyond
January 1, 2000 with respect to resolution of non-critical issues. However,
these dates are contingent upon the timeliness and accuracy of software and
hardware upgrades from vendors, adequacy and

                                      35
<PAGE>

quality of resources available to work on completion of the project and any
other unforeseen factors.

Costs.  The total expense of the Year 2000 plan is currently estimated to be
approximately $25 million, although actual expenditures may differ.  Actual
costs incurred through the end of the second quarter of 1999 were approximately
$15 million, the majority of which was expensed. The expenses of the Year 2000
project are being funded through operating cash flows.

Estimates.  The costs of the Year 2000 plan and the dates on which we believe we
will complete the Year 2000 modifications are based on management's best
estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events,
including the continued availability of certain resources, third-party
modification plans and other factors.  We cannot give any assurance that these
estimates will be achieved.  Consequently, actual results could differ
materially from those anticipated.

Contingency Planning. While substantial contingency planning has occurred, we
have not yet completed a comprehensive contingency plan to address situations
that may result if we are unable to achieve Year 2000 readiness of our critical
operations. Development of contingency plans is in progress and will develop and
expand during the remainder of 1999. We cannot give any assurance that we will
be able to develop a contingency plan that will adequately address all issues
that may arise in the year 2000. Our failure to develop and implement, if
necessary, an appropriate contingency plan could have a material adverse impact
on our operations. Finally, we are also vulnerable to external forces that might
generally affect industry and commerce, such as utility or transportation
company Year 2000 compliance failures and related service interruptions.

Demand for Our Products Affected by Asian and Other Domestic and International
Economic Conditions

While general industry demand is currently strengthening, the demand for our
products during the last few years has been weak due to the general downturn in
the worldwide semiconductor market and an economic crisis in Asia. The economic
crisis in Asia may continue to adversely affect our business. A renewed decline
of the worldwide semiconductor market and economic condition in Asia could
decrease the demand for microprocessors and other ICs. A significant decline in
economic conditions in any significant geographic area, both domestically and
internationally, could decrease the overall demand for our products.

Flash Memory Products

Competition in the market for Flash memory devices continues to increase as
existing manufacturers introduce new products and industry-wide production
capacity increases, and as Intel continues to aggressively price its Flash
memory products. We expect competition in the marketplace for Flash memory
devices to continue to increase.   It is possible that we will be unable to
maintain or increase our market share in Flash memory devices as the market
develops and as existing and potential new competitors introduce competitive
products. A decline in our Flash memory device business or decline in the gross
margin percentage in this product line could have a material adverse effect on
this product line.

Other Risk Factors

Debt Restrictions. The Loan Agreement and the Indenture contain significant
covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries' ability to engage in
various transactions and require satisfaction

                                       36
<PAGE>

of specified financial performance criteria. In addition, the occurrence of
certain events, including, among other things, failure to comply with the
foregoing covenants, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties,
certain defaults under or acceleration of other indebtedness and events of
bankruptcy or insolvency would, in certain cases after notice and grace periods,
constitute events of default permitting acceleration of indebtedness. The
limitations imposed by the Loan Agreement and the Indenture are substantial, and
failure to comply with such limitations could have a material adverse effect on
our business.

In addition, the Dresden Loan Agreements substantially prohibit AMD Saxony from
transferring assets to us, which will prevent us from using current or future
assets of AMD Saxony other than to satisfy obligations of AMD Saxony.

Technological Change and Industry Standards. The market for our products is
generally characterized by rapid technological developments, evolving industry
standards, changes in customer requirements, frequent new product introductions
and enhancements, short product life cycles and severe price competition.
Currently accepted industry standards may change.  Our success depends
substantially on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue
to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that
take advantage of technological advances and adhere to evolving industry
standards. An unexpected change in one or more of the technologies related to
our products, in market demand for products based on a particular technology or
of accepted industry standards could materially and adversely affect our
business.  We may or may not be able to develop new products in a timely and
satisfactory manner to address new industry standards and technological changes,
or to respond to new product announcements by others.  In addition, new products
may or may not achieve market acceptance.

Competition. The IC industry is intensely competitive and, historically, has
experienced rapid technological advances in product and system technologies.
After a product is introduced, prices normally decrease over time as production
efficiency and competition increase, and as successive generations of products
are developed and introduced for sale.  Technological advances in the industry
result in frequent product introductions, regular price reductions, short
product life cycles and increased product capabilities that may result in
significant performance improvements. Competition in the sale of ICs is based
on:

    .  performance;
    .  product quality and reliability;
    .  price;
    .  adherence to industry standards;
    .  software and hardware compatibility;
    .  marketing and distribution capability;
    .  brand recognition;
    .  financial strength; and
    .  ability to deliver in large volumes on a timely basis.

Fluctuations in Operating Results. Our operating results are subject to
substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a variety of factors,
including:

                                       37
<PAGE>

    .  the effects of competition with Intel in microprocessor and Flash memory
       device markets;
    .  competitive pricing pressures;
    .  anticipated decreases in unit average selling prices of our products;
    .  production capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields;
    .  availability and cost of products from our suppliers;
    .  the gain or loss of significant customers;
    .  new product introductions by us or our competitors;
    .  changes in the mix of products produced and sold and in the mix of sales
       by distribution channels;
    .  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products;
    .  seasonal customer demand due to vacation and holiday schedules (for
       example, decreased demand in Europe during the summer); and
    .  the timing of significant orders and the timing and extent of product
       development costs.

In addition, operating results have recently been, and may in the future be,
adversely affected by general economic and other conditions causing a downturn
in the market for semiconductor devices, or otherwise affecting the timing of
customer orders or causing order cancellations or rescheduling. Our customers
may change delivery schedules or cancel orders without significant penalty. Many
of the factors listed above are outside of our control. These factors are
difficult to forecast, and these or other factors could materially and adversely
affect our quarterly or annual operating results.

Order Revision and Cancellation Policies. We manufacture and market standard
lines of products. Sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders for
current delivery, or agreements covering purchases over a period of time, which
may be revised or canceled without penalty.  As a result, we must commit
resources to the production of products without any advance purchase commitments
from customers. Our inability to sell products after we devoted significant
resources to them could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products. In most instances
our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against
price reductions, as well as products that are slow moving or have been
discontinued.  These agreements, which may be canceled by either party on a
specified notice, generally allow for the return of our products if the
agreement with the distributor is terminated.  The market for our products is
generally characterized by, among other things, severe price competition. The
price protection and return rights we offer to our distributors could materially
and adversely affect us if there is an unexpected significant decline in the
price of our products.

Key Personnel. Our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous
key engineering, manufacturing, sales and executive personnel.  We may or may
not be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for
the development and manufacture of our products.  Loss of the service of, or
failure to recruit, key engineering design personnel could be significantly
detrimental to our product development programs or otherwise have a material
adverse effect on our business.

Intellectual Property Rights; Potential Litigation.  It is possible that:

                                       38
<PAGE>

    .  we will be unable to protect our technology or other intellectual
       property adequately through patents, copyrights, trade secrets,
       trademarks and other measures;
    .  patent applications that we may file will not be issued;
    .  foreign intellectual property laws will not protect our intellectual
       property rights;
    .  any patent licensed by or issued to us will be challenged, invalidated or
       circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will not provide
       competitive advantages to us; and
    .  others will independently develop similar products, duplicate our
       products or design around our patents and other rights.

From time to time, we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual
property rights of others.  If any such claims are asserted against us, we may
seek to obtain a license under the third party's intellectual property rights.
We could decide, in the alternative, to resort to litigation to challenge such
claims.  Such challenges could be extremely expensive and time-consuming and
could materially and adversely affect our business.  We cannot give any
assurance that all necessary licenses can be obtained on satisfactory terms, or
whether litigation may always be avoided or successfully concluded.

Environmental Regulations. We could possibly be subject to fines, suspension of
production, alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of our
operations if we fail to comply with present or future governmental regulations
related to the use, storage, handling, discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile
or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process.  Such
regulations could require us to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to
incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations.  Our failure to
control the use, disposal or storage of, or adequately restrict the discharge
of, hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

International Sales. Our international sales operations entail political and
economic risks, including expropriation, currency controls, exchange rate
fluctuations, changes in freight rates and changes in rates and exemptions for
taxes and tariffs.

Volatility of Stock Price; Ability to Access Capital. Based on the trading
history of our stock, we believe that the following factors have caused and are
likely to continue to cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate
substantially:

    .  quarterly fluctuations in our financial results;
    .  announcements of new products and/or pricing by us or our competitors;
    .  the pace of new product manufacturing ramps;
    .  production yields of key products; and
    .  general conditions in the semiconductor industry.

In addition, an actual or anticipated shortfall in revenue, gross margins or
earnings from securities analysts' expectations could have an immediate effect
on the trading price of our common stock in any given period.  Technology
company stocks in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations
that are often unrelated to the operating performance of the companies.  This
market volatility may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and
consequently limit our ability to raise capital or to make acquisitions.  Our
current business plan envisions substantial cash outlays requiring external
capital financing. It is possible

                                       39
<PAGE>

that capital and/or long-term financing will be unavailable on terms favorable
to us or in sufficient amounts to enable us to implement our current plan.

Earthquake Danger. Our corporate headquarters, a portion of our manufacturing
facilities, assembly and research and development activities and certain other
critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines. We
could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.

Euro Conversion. On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of
the European Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing
currencies and the euro.  The participating countries adopted the euro as their
common legal currency on that date.  The transition period will last through
January 1, 2002.  We are assessing the potential impact to us that may result
from the euro conversion.  We do not expect the introduction and use of the euro
to materially affect our foreign exchange activities, to affect our use of
derivatives and other financial instruments, or to result in any material
increase in costs to us.  We will continue to assess the impact of the
introduction of the euro currency over the transition period as well as the
period subsequent to the transition, as applicable.


ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
         RISK

In 1998, we entered into a no-cost collar arrangement to hedge Dresden Fab 30
project costs through which we purchased $300 million of put option contracts
and sold $300 million of call option contracts. In the second quarter of 1999,
we entered into a no-cost collar arrangement to offset and neutralize our
remaining 1998 no-cost collar position.

For additional Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,
including other foreign exchange risks associated with Dresden Fab 30,
reference is made to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
27, 1998.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

          AMD V. ALTERA CORPORATION. This litigation, which began in 1994,
          involves multiple claims and counterclaims for patent infringement
          relating to AMD's and Altera Corporation's programmable logic devices.
          In a trial held in May 1996, a jury found that at least five of the
          eight AMD patents-in-suit were licensed to Altera. As a result of the
          bench trial held in August 1997, the Court held that Altera was
          licensed to the three remaining AMD patents-in-suit. Seven patents
          were asserted by Altera in its counterclaim against AMD. The Court
          determined that we are licensed to five of the seven patents and two
          remain in suit. Altera filed a motion to recover attorneys' fees in
          November 1997. AMD then filed, and the Court granted, a motion to stay
          determination of the attorneys' fees motion until resolution of its
          appeal. AMD filed an appeal of the rulings of the jury and Court
          determinations that Altera is licensed to each of our eight
          patents-in-suit. Both parties filed briefs and the Federal Court of
          Appeal heard oral argument on our appeal in November 1998. In April
          1999, the Federal Court of Appeal reversed the earlier jury and Court
          decisions and held that Altera is not licensed to the eight AMD
          patents-in-suit. Also in April 1999, and following the decision of the
          Federal Court of Appeal, Altera filed a petition for rehearing. In
          June 1999, in connection with the sale of Vantis to Lattice
          Semiconductor Corporation, AMD transferred this proceeding and
          substantially all of its rights and liabilities relating to this
          action to Vantis.

          SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LITIGATION.  Between March 10, 1999 and
          April 22, 1999, AMD and certain individual officers of AMD were named
          as defendants in the following lawsuits: Arthur S. Feldman v. Advanced
          Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Pamela Lee v. Advanced Micro Devices,
          Inc., et al.; Izidor Klein v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.;
          Nancy P. Steinman v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Robert L.
          Dworkin v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Howard M. Lasker v.
          Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; John K. Thompson v. Advanced
          Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Dan Schwartz v. Advanced Micro Devices,
          Inc., et al.; Serena Salamon and Norman Silverberg v. Advanced Micro
          Devices, Inc., et al.; David Wu and Hossein Mizraie v. Advanced Micro
          Devices, Inc., et al.; Eidman v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.;
          Nold v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Freeland v. Advanced
          Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; Fradkin v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
          et al.; Ellis Investment Co. v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.;
          Dezwareh v. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al.; and Tordjman v.
          Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., et al. These class action complaints
          allege various violations of federal securities law, including
          violations of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule
          10b-5 promulgated thereunder. Most of the complaints purportedly were
          filed on behalf of all persons, other than the defendants, who
          purchased or otherwise acquired common stock of AMD during the period
          from October 6, 1998 to March 8, 1999. Two of the complaints allege a
          class period from July 13, 1998 to March 9, 1999. All of the
          complaints allege that materially misleading statements and/or
          material omissions were made by AMD and certain individual officers of
          AMD concerning design and production problems relating to high-speed
          versions of the AMD-K6-2 and AMD-K6-III microprocessors. The
          complaints seek unspecified

                                      41
<PAGE>

          damages, equitable relief, interest, fees and other litigation costs.
          AMD expects that these suits will be consolidated into one action
          within the next several months. AMD intends to contest the litigation
          vigorously. Based upon information presently known to management, AMD
          does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these lawsuits will
          have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
          of operations.

          This FIRST AMENDMENT TO STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of June 7,
1999 is entered into by and between Lattice Semiconductor Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Seller"). Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used
herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Stock Purchase
Agreement, dated as of April 21, 1999, by and between Buyer and Seller (the
"Stock Purchase Agreement").

                                   RECITALS

          A.  Seller and Buyer entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement,
whereby Seller has agreed to sell, and Buyer has agreed to purchase, all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of Vantis Corporation ("Vantis").

          B.  Seller and Buyer desire to amend certain terms of the Stock

                                   AGREEMENT

          Now, therefore, in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

     1.  Amendment

         Section 1.3 of the Stock Purchase Agreement shall be deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following:

               "1.3   The Closing. The Closing shall take place at the offices
                      -----------
     of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto,
     California 94304-1050 on June 14, 1999, or as soon as practicable after all
     conditions specified in Articles VI, VII and VIII have been satisfied or
     waived in accordance with this Agreement, but not later than the fifth
     business day following the date that all conditions specified in Articles
     VI, VII and VIII have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
     Agreement, or at such other place or on such other date as Seller and Buyer
     may mutually agree."

     2.   Miscellaneous

          a.  Stock Purchase Agreement Otherwise Not Affected. Except as
expressly amended pursuant hereto, the Stock Purchase Agreement shall remain
unchanged and in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed in
all respects.

          b.  Amendment and Waivers. This Amendment may be amended only by an
agreement in writing executed on behalf of both Buyer and Seller. No waiver of
any provision nor consent to any exception to the terms of the Amendment shall
be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only
to the specific purpose, extent and instance so provided.
<PAGE>

          c.  Integration. This Amendment constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection therewith.

          d.  No Assignment. Neither this Amendment nor any rights or
obligations under it are assignable, except that Buyer may assign its rights,
but not its obligations, hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer.
Subject to the foregoing sentence, this Amendment is binding upon and inures to
the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

          e.  Counterparts. This Amendment and any amendment hereto or any other
agreement or document delivered pursuant hereto may be executed in one or more
counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts. All of such
counterparts shall constitute one and the same agreement or other document and
shall become effective unless otherwise provided therein when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party.

          f.  Severability. If any provision of this Amendment is determined to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any Governmental Entity, the remaining
provisions of this Amendment shall remain in full force and effect provided that
the essential terms and conditions of this Amendment for both parties remain
valid, binding and enforceable. To the extent permitted by Law, the parties
hereby to the same extent waive any provision of Law that renders any provision
hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

          g.  Parties in Interest. Except as set forth in Article 10 of the
Stock Purchase Agreement with respect to Indemnified Parties, nothing in this
Amendment, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Amendment.

          h.  Governing Law. This Amendment, the legal relations between the
parties and any Action, whether contractual or non-contractual, instituted by
any party with respect to matters arising under or growing out of or in
connection with or in respect of this Amendment shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to
contracts made and performed in such State and without regard to conflicts of
law doctrines.

valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

     1.   AMENDMENTS

          a.   The fifth sentence of Section 1.2 of the Stock Purchase
     Agreement, describing the calculation of the Company Per Share Value, is
     hereby amended and restated as follows:

               "The Company Per Share Value shall equal the quotient determined
               by dividing the Estimated Purchase Price (as defined in Section
               1.4) by the fully diluted number of shares of Company common
               stock outstanding immediately prior to the close of this
               transaction (reflecting all shares subject to Company Options
               (but excluding any shares subject to Company Options granted
               after April 21, 1999)), without applying the treasury method."

          b.   The final sentence of Section 1.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement
     is hereby amended and restated as follows:

               "As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event more than 90
               days after the Closing Date, Buyer will issue to each person who
               immediately prior to the Closing Date was a holder of Company
               Options a document evidencing the foregoing assumption of such
               option by Buyer."

<PAGE>

          c.   Section 1.3 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting Section 1.3 in its entirety and replacing it with the following:

               "The Closing.  The Closing shall take place at the offices of
               Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo
               Alto, California 94304-1050 on June 15, 1999, or as soon as
               practicable after all conditions specified in Articles VI, VII
               and VIII have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
               Agreement, but not later than the fifth business day following
               the date that all conditions specified in Articles VI, VII and
               VIII have been satisfied or waived in accordance with this
               Agreement, or at such other place or on such other date as Seller
               and Buyer may mutually agree."

          d.   The heading of Section 5.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is
    hereby amended to read "No Rights to Seller Intellectual Property and
    Limited Trademark License."

          e.   Section 5.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended to
    insert an "(a)" immediately prior to the text thereof

          f.   Section 5.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended to
    add new Section 5.2(b) as follows:

               "(b) Seller hereby grants to Company and Buyer, for the period
               beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of the
               fifteenth month following the Closing Date, a worldwide, non-
               exclusive, non-transferable license under the Transition
               Trademarks (as defined below) to use such trademarks in
               connection with documentation, collateral materials, packaging
               and sale of Transition Products (as defined below) in
               substantially the same manner that such trademarks were used by
               the Seller or Company prior to the Closing; provided, however,
               that no Transition Trademark shall be used in public advertising
               of any product, service or entity. Company shall maintain the
               quality of the goods with which such trademarks are used at the
               level maintained by Company or Seller prior to Closing. Without
               limiting the foregoing, neither Buyer nor Company shall use the
               Transition Trademarks in a manner that detracts from the goodwill
               associated with the use of such trademarks or in a manner
               contrary to the reasonable instructions of Seller. All goodwill
               associated with the use of such Transition Trademarks shall inure
               to the benefit of Seller. Buyer and Company agree to use
               commercially reasonable efforts to obtain or to effect customer
               qualifications of the Transition Products to remove the
               Transition Trademarks. For the purposes of this Section 5.2(b),
               (A) "Transition Products" means all products sold, offered for
               sale, or provided by Company prior to the

                                       2
<PAGE>

               Closing including all such products in the Company's inventory as
               of the Closing Date, and (B) "Transition Trademarks" means all
               trademarks, logos, graphics, and trade dress of Seller used by
               Company prior to the Closing Date in connection with the
               marketing, sale, promotion and packaging of the Transition
               Products, other than those which are transferred to Company.
               Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller against any Loss
               arising out of any warranty or product liability claims asserted
               against Seller with respect to Transition Products sold by
               Company or Buyer after the Closing Date resulting from Buyers or
               Company's use of the Transition Marks, except to the extent that
               such claim arises from a breach by Seller or Company of any
               representation or warranty hereunder. The indemnity provided in
               this Section 5.2 shall be subject to Sections 10.3 and 10.4 of
               this Agreement but not the other provisions of Article X."

          g.   Section 5.8 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     adding a new sentence at the end of such Section, which shall read as
     follows:

               "Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
               the lease identified as Item 1 to Schedule 5.8 (re "Premises at
               985/995 Stewart Drive, Sunnyvale, California") shall be assigned
               immediately following the Closing Date pursuant to the Lease
               Assignment and Assumption Agreement in the form attached hereto
               as Exhibit 5.8(a)."

          h.   Section 5.14 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting clause (a) of Section 5.14 and replacing it with the following:

               "(a) Seller shall continue to use its best efforts to obtain such
               Approval from and after the Closing, subject (in the case of
               software licenses) to the Limit, as set forth in Section
               5.16(c)."

          i.   Section 5.16 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting Section 5.16(a) in its entirety and replacing it with the
     following:

               "(a) This Section 5.16 does not apply to Intellectual Property or
               trade secrets, except that this Section 5.16 does apply to the
               Intellectual Property of the type described in clause (i)(B) or
               (i)(C) of Section 2.8(b) (the "Applicable Intellectual Property")
               identified on the Schedule to clause (i) of Section 2.8(b) and
               the Applicable Intellectual Property referred to in the board
               resolutions identified in Section 5.16(b)(i) (or the attachments
               thereto) and the unregistered trademarks listed on the Schedule
               to clause (i) of Section 2.8(b).

          j.   Section 5.16 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting Section 5.16(c) in its entirety and replacing it with the
     following:

               "(c) To the extent any Other Business Assets have not been
               assigned and transferred prior to Closing, Seller shall take such
               additionally

                                       3
<PAGE>

               commercially reasonable actions after the Closing to effect such
               assignments and transfers as are reasonably requested by Buyer
               (or, in the case of any third party software licenses, replace
               such license); provided, however, that with respect to the
               transfer and assignment of any third party software licenses
               contemplated by this Section 5.16 or Section 5.14(a), or
               otherwise necessary or used to conduct the Business (unless only
               necessary or used to conduct the bi-polar programmable logic
               device business) as conducted prior to the Closing (but without
               reliance on the rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates, other
               than the Company) (collectively, "Third Party Licenses"), Seller
               shall use commercially reasonable actions after the Closing to
               effect such assignments and transfers (or replace the licenses
               with substantially similar licenses). Buyer may make arrangements
               for the transfer or assignment of Third Party Licenses (or the
               replacement thereof with substantially similar licenses) and
               Seller shall reimburse Buyer any sums paid to third party
               licensors for such transfers, assignments and replacements;
               provided that this sentence shall not apply to the EDA Software
               licenses from Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (the "Cadence
               Licenses"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be
               obligated to pay to third party licensors and/or reimburse Buyer
               amounts (other than amounts in respect of the Cadence Licenses)
               in excess of $800,000 in the aggregate for all such assignments,
               transfers, replacements or reimbursements (the "Limit"). In
               addition, Seller's obligations to expend sums for the assignment,
               transfer or replacement of Third Party Licenses shall terminate
               on the first anniversary of the Closing Date. Payments made by
               Seller to licensors for the assignment, transfer or replacement
               of Third Party Licenses, which are subject to the Limit, shall
               not be made without the consent of Buyer, which consent shall not
               be unreasonably withheld."

          k.   Section 5.16(d) of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended
     by deleting Section 5.16(d) in its entirety and replacing it with the
     following:

               "(d) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5.16(c), the
               assignments and transfers pursuant to this Section 5.16 shall be
               at no cost to Buyer, Company or their respective subsidiaries and
               Affiliates; provided, however, that the transfer by Seller and
               purchase by Company of certain leasehold improvements at Stewart
               Drive, Sunnyvale, California at or prior to the Closing shall
               take place for $3,768,000."

          l.   Section 5.16 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     adding a new Section 5.16(e) immediately after Section 15.16(d), which
     shall read in its entirety as follows:

               "(e) Seller will execute or cause its controlled Affiliates to
               execute, if applicable, all such further assignments and other
               documents as are reasonably requested by Buyer to give effect to,
               record and evidence any assignments and transfers required to be
               made pursuant hereto or

                                       4
<PAGE>

               Section 5.15 at no cost to Buyer, Company or their respective
               subsidiaries and Affiliates."

          m.   Section 13.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting the penultimate sentence of the definition of "Agreed Accounting
     Principles" and inserting in lieu thereof the following:

               "Except for the purchase of certain leasehold improvements
               contemplated by the proviso of Section 5.16(d), which shall be
               valued at $3,768,000, assets contributed to Company or any
               Subsidiary by Seller or any of its controlled Affiliates after
               the date hereof will be valued at zero."

          n.   Section 13.2 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting the first sentence of the definition of "Business" which reads
     "`Business' means the business of Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a
     whole, and shall be deemed to include the following incidents of such
     business: income, cash flow, operations, condition (financial or other),
     assets, properties, revenues and liabilities" and replacing it with the
     following:

               "'Business' means the business of Company and the Subsidiaries
               taken as a whole (including the bi-polar programmable logic
               device business of Seller, whether or not previously included in
               the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries), and shall be
               deemed to include the following incidents of such business:
               income, cash flow, operations, condition (financial or other),
               assets, properties, revenues and liabilities."

          o.   Section 1.4 of the Stock Purchase Agreement is hereby amended by
     deleting the second sentence of such Section which reads "Not later than
     five business days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer
     a written notice setting forth Seller's good faith estimate (applying the
     Agreed Accounting Principles) as of the Closing Date of the Closing Equity
     Adjustment Amount (the "Estimated Closing Equity Adjustment Amount") and,
     based thereon, Seller's calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price, which
     shall be binding on Buyer and Seller as the Estimated Purchase Price
     hereunder absent manifest error" and replacing it with the following:

               "Not later than five business days prior to the Closing Date,
               Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written notice setting forth
               Seller's good faith estimate (applying the Agreed Accounting
               Principles), which estimate shall be based upon a balance sheet
               prepared as of a date no earlier than five days prior to the
               Closing Date, of the Closing Equity Adjustment Amount (the
               "Estimated Closing Equity Adjustment Amount") and, based thereon,
               Seller's calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price, which shall
               be binding on Buyer and Seller as the Estimated Purchase Price
               hereunder absent manifest error."

     2.   Miscellaneous

          a.  Stock Purchase Agreement Otherwise Not Affected. Except as
expressly amended pursuant hereto, the Stock Purchase Agreement shall remain
unchanged and in full force and effect and is hereby ratified and confirmed in
all respects.

          b.  Amendment and Waivers. This Amendment may be amended only by an
agreement in writing executed on behalf of both Buyer and Seller. No waiver of
any provision nor consent to any exception to the terms of the Amendment shall
be effective unless in writing and signed by the party to be bound and then only
to the specific purpose, extent and instance so provided.

          c.  Integration. This Amendment constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior agreements and understandings of the parties in connection therewith.

          d.  No Assignment. Neither this Amendment nor any rights or
obligations under it are assignable, except that Buyer may assign its rights,
but not its obligations, hereunder to any wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer.
Subject to the foregoing sentence, this Amendment is binding upon and inures to
the benefit of and is enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

          e.  Counterparts. This Amendment and any amendment hereto or any other
agreement or document delivered pursuant hereto may be executed in one or more

counterparts shall constitute one and the same agreement or other document and
shall become effective unless otherwise provided therein when one or more
counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to the other party.

          f.  Severability. If any provision of this Amendment is determined to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any Governmental Entity, the remaining
provisions of this Amendment shall remain in full force and effect provided that
the essential terms and conditions of this Amendment for both parties remain
valid, binding and enforceable. To the extent permitted by Law, the parties
hereby to the same extent waive any provision of Law that renders any provision
hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.

          g.  Parties in Interest. Except as set forth in Article 10 of the
Stock Purchase Agreement with respect to Indemnified Parties, nothing in this
Amendment, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Amendment.

          h.  Governing Law. This Amendment, the legal relations between the
parties and any Action, whether contractual or non-contractual, instituted by
any party with respect to matters arising under or growing out of or in
connection with or in respect of this Amendment shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California applicable to
contracts made and performed in such State and without regard to conflicts of
law doctrines.

                  Syndicated Loan Agreement of March 11, 1997



                                    between


1.  AMD Saxony Manufacturing GmbH, Dresden, registered with the Commercial
    Register at the Dresden Local Court under HRB 13186

                                         - hereinafter "AMD Saxonia" -
2.  Dresdner Bank AG

3.  the banks and financial institutions referred to on the signature page of
    this Supplemental Agreement

                                         - hereinafter also referred to,
                                           together with Dresdner Bank AG, as
                                           the "Banks", or each a "Bank" -
and

4.  Dresdner Bank Luxembourg S.A.

                                         - hereinafter "Agent" -



                                    PREAMBLE

1.  On March 11, 1997, AMD Saxonia, Dresdner Bank AG, the other Banks and the
    Agent (the latter at such time in its capacity as "Paying Agent" only) have
    entered into a Syndicated Loan Agreement (hereinafter "Loan Agreement") in a
    total loan amount of DM 1,650,000,000.--for the partial financing of the
    Project Costs defined in more detail in the Loan Agreement. The Agent has
    been appointed as such on June 1, 1997.

2.  Due to significant technological changes and consequential increased
    financing needs, the financing obligations of AMD Holding and AMD Inc.
    agreed in connection with the Loan Agreement and certain other provisions of
    the Loan Agreement and related documents have been amended on February 6,
    1998 within the framework of Supplemental Agreements to the Loan Agreement
    and the Operative Documents referred to therein.
<PAGE>

3.  In the Supplemental Agreement of February 6, 1998, AMD Inc. and AMD Holding
    undertook, due to restrictions agreed in the AMD Inc. Senior Secured Note
    Indenture (as defined in the Sponsors' Support Agreement), to provide AMD
    Saxonia by June 30, 1999 with the funds to be made available under the Class
    C Sponsors' Loans (as defined in the Sponsors' Support Agreement) from funds
    received by AMD Inc. on the basis of a stock offering in an amount of at
    least USD 200 million. Recent amendments to the AMD Inc. Senior Secured Note
    Indenture will permit AMD Inc. to fund the Class C Sponsors' Loans without
    undertaking a stock offering as described in the previous sentence. The
    Banks are prepared to waive the requirement of funding the Class C Sponsors'
    Loans from funds received from the proceeds of a stock offering of AMD Inc.,
    and to amend the relevant provisions of the Sponsors' Support Agreement and
    the Sponsors' Loan Agreement accordingly.

4.  The Banks have further agreed with AMD Inc., AMD Holding and AMD Saxonia
    that a new Management Plan and a new Project Budget shall be agreed.

     references in the Loan Agreement and in the Operative Documents, and all
     statements relating thereto, shall apply in the same manner to this
     Supplemental Agreement No. 2.

           Agent shall notify the Lenders by telecopy, telephone or other

           funds, to such account of the Agent as the Agent may designate, not
           later than 12:00 noon (Pasadena, California time) on the Funding Date

           the date of such Borrowing, that such Lender will not make available
           as and when required hereunder to the Agent for the account of the
           Borrower the amount of that Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing,
           the Agent may assume that each Lender has made such amount available
           to the Agent in immediately available funds on the Funding Date and
           the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance upon such
           assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
           corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Lender shall not have
           made its full amount available to the Agent in immediately available
           funds and the Agent in such circumstances has made available to the
           Borrower such amount, that Lender shall on the Business Day following
           such Funding Date make such amount available to the Agent, together
           with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such
           period. A notice by the Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to
           amounts owing under this subsection shall be conclusive, absent
           manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to
           the Agent shall constitute such Lender's Revolving Loan for all
           purposes of this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to
           the Agent on the Business Day following the Funding Date, the Agent
           will notify the Borrower of such failure to fund and, upon demand by
           the Agent, the Borrower shall pay such amount to the Agent for the
           Agent's account,

                                      -29-

           together with interest thereon for each day elapsed since the date of
           such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate
           applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans comprising such
           Borrowing. The failure of any Lender to make any Revolving Loan on
           any Funding Date (any such Lender, prior to the cure of such failure,
           being hereinafter referred to as a "Defaulting Lender") shall not
           relieve any other Lender of any obligation hereunder to make a
           Revolving Loan on such Funding Date, but no Lender shall be
           responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving
           Loan to be made by such other Lender on any Funding Date.

                    (iii)   The Agent shall not be obligated to transfer to a
           Defaulting Lender any payments made by Borrower to the Agent for the
           Defaulting Lender's benefit; nor shall a Defaulting Lender be
           entitled to the sharing of any payments hereunder. Amounts payable to
           a Defaulting Lender shall instead be paid to or retained by the
           Agent. The Agent may hold and, in its reasonable discretion, re-lend
           to Borrower the amount of all such payments received or retained by
           it for the account of such Defaulting Lender. Any amounts so re-lent
           to the Borrower shall bear interest based on the Base Rate or the
           LIBOR Rate, at the election of the Borrower, and for all other
           purposes of this Agreement shall be treated as if they were Revolving
           Loans, provided, however, that for purposes of voting or consenting
           to matters with respect to the Loan Documents and determining Pro
           Rata Shares, such Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be a
           "Lender". Until a Defaulting Lender cures its failure to fund its Pro
           Rata Share of any Borrowing (A) such Defaulting Lender shall not be
           entitled to any portion of the Unused Line Fee and (B) the Unused
           Line Fee shall accrue in favor of the Lenders which have funded their
           respective Pro Rata Shares of such requested Borrowing and shall be
           allocated among such performing Lenders ratably based upon their
           relative Commitments. This Section shall remain effective with
           respect to such Lender until such time as the Defaulting Lender shall
           no longer be in default of any of its obligations under this
           Agreement. The terms of this Section shall not be construed to
           increase or otherwise affect the Commitment of any Lender, or relieve
           or excuse the performance by the Borrower of its duties and
           obligations hereunder.

           (h)  Making of Non-Ratable Loans.
           --------------------------------

                    (i)     In the event the Agent shall elect, with the consent
          of the Bank, to have the terms of this Section 2.2(h) apply to a
                                                 --------------

          requested Borrowing as described in Section 2.2(f), the Bank shall
                                              --------------
          make a Revolving Loan in the amount of such Borrowing (any such
          Revolving Loan made solely by the Bank pursuant to this Section 2.2(h)
                                                                  --------------
          being referred to as a "Non-Ratable Loan" and such Revolving Loans
          being referred to collectively as "Non-Ratable Loans") available to
          the Borrower on the Funding Date applicable thereto by transferring
          same day funds to a deposit account of the Borrower designated in
          writing by the Borrower and acceptable to the Agent. Each Non-Ratable
          Loan is a Revolving Loan hereunder and shall be subject to all the
          terms and conditions applicable to other Revolving Loans except that
          all payments thereon shall be payable to the Bank solely for its own
          account (and for the account of the holder of any participation
          interest with respect to such Revolving Loan). The Agent shall not
          request the Bank to make any Non-Ratable Loan if (A) the Agent shall
          have received written notice from any Lender that one or more of the
          applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 10 will not be
                                                       ----------
          satisfied on the requested Funding Date for the applicable Borrowing,
          or (B) the requested Borrowing would exceed the Availability on such
          Funding Date. The Bank shall not otherwise be required to determine
          whether the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 10
                                                                   ----------
          have been satisfied or the requested Borrowing would exceed the
          Availability on the Funding Date applicable thereto prior to making,
          in its sole discretion, any Non-Ratable Loan.

                    (ii)    The Non-Ratable Loans shall be secured by the
          Agent's Liens in and to the Collateral, shall constitute Revolving
          Loans and Obligations hereunder, and shall bear interest at the rate
          applicable to the Revolving Loans from time to time.

          (i)  Agent Advances.
          -------------------

                    (i)     Subject to the limitations set forth in the provisos
          contained in this Section 2.2(i), the Agent is hereby authorized by
                            --------------
          the Borrower and the Lenders, from time to time in the Agent's sole
          discretion, (A) after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of
          Default, or (B) at any time that any of the other applicable
          conditions precedent set forth in Article 10 have not been satisfied,
                                            ----------
          to make Base Rate Loans to the Borrower on behalf of the Lenders which
          the Agent, in its reasonable business judgment, deems necessary or
          desirable (1) to preserve or protect the Collateral, or any portion
          thereof, (2) to enhance the likelihood of, or maximize the amount of,
          repayment of the Loans and other Obligations, or (3) to pay any other
          amount chargeable to the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
          Agreement, including costs, fees and expenses as

                                      -31-
<PAGE>

          described in Section 15.7 (any of the advances described in this
                       ------------
          Section 2.2(i) being hereinafter referred to as "Agent Advances");
          --------------
          provided, that the Required Lenders may at any time revoke the Agent's
          --------
          authorization contained in this Section 2.2(i) to make Agent Advances,
                                          --------------
          any such revocation to be in writing and to become effective
          prospectively upon the Agent's receipt thereof; and provided further
                                                              -------- -------
          that, subject to the final proviso of Section 13.2, the Agent shall
                                                ------------
          not intentionally make Agent Advances which would cause the Aggregate
          Revolver Outstandings to exceed the Borrowing Base.

                    (ii)    The Agent Advances shall be repayable on demand and
          secured by the Agent's Liens in and to the Collateral, shall
          constitute Revolving Loans and Obligations hereunder, and shall bear
          interest at the Base Rate applicable to the Revolving Loans from time
          to time. The Agent shall notify each Lender in writing of each such
          Agent Advance.

          (j)  Settlement.  It is agreed that each Lender's funded portion of
               ----------
the Revolving Loans is intended by the Lenders to be equal at all times to such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the outstanding Revolving Loans. Notwithstanding such
agreement, the Agent, the Bank, and the other Lenders agree (which agreement
shall not be for the benefit of or enforceable by the Borrower) that in order to
facilitate the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
settlement among them as to the Revolving Loans, the Non-Ratable Loans and the
Agent Advances shall take place on a periodic basis in accordance with the
following provisions:

                    (i)     The Agent shall request settlement ("Settlement")
          with the Lenders on at least a weekly basis, or on a more frequent
          basis if so determined by the Agent, (A) on behalf of the Bank, with
          respect to each outstanding Non-Ratable Loan, (B) for itself, with
          respect to each Agent Advance, and (C) with respect to collections
          received, in each case, by notifying the Lenders of such requested
          Settlement by telecopy, telephone or other similar form of
          transmission, of such requested Settlement, no later than 10:00 a.m.
          (Pasadena, California time) on the date of such requested Settlement
          (the "Settlement Date"). Each Lender (other than the Bank, in the case
          of Non-Ratable Loans, and the Agent, in the case of Agent Advances)
          shall make the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the
          outstanding principal amount of the Non-Ratable Loans and Agent
          Advances with respect to which Settlement is requested available to
          the Agent, to such account of the Agent as the Agent may designate,
          not later than 12:00 noon (Pasadena, California time), on the
          Settlement Date applicable thereto, which may occur before or after
          the occurrence or during the continuation of a Default or an Event of
          Default and whether or

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

          not the applicable conditions precedent set forth in Article 10 have
                                                               ----------
          then been satisfied. Such amounts made available to the Agent shall be
          applied against the amounts of the applicable Non-Ratable Loan or
          Agent Advance and, together with the portion of such Non-Ratable Loan
          or Agent Advance representing the Bank's Pro Rata Share thereof, shall
          constitute Revolving Loans of such Lenders. If any such amount is not
          made available to the Agent by any Lender on the Settlement Date
          applicable thereto, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount
          on demand from such Lender together with interest thereon at the
          Federal Funds Rate for the first three (3) days from and after the
          Settlement Date and thereafter at the Base Rate then applicable to the
          Revolving Loans.

                    (ii)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, not more than one (1)
          Business Day after demand is made by the Agent (whether before or
          after the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default and
          regardless of whether the Agent has requested a Settlement with
          respect to a Non-Ratable Loan or Agent Advance), each other Lender (A)
          shall irrevocably and unconditionally purchase and receive from the
          Bank or the Agent, as applicable, without recourse or warranty, an
          undivided interest and participation in such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent
          Advance equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loan
          or Agent Advance, and (B) if Settlement has not previously occurred
          with respect to such Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances shall pay to
          Bank or Agent, as applicable, as the purchase price of such
          participation an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%) of such
          Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Non-Ratable Loans or Agent Advances.
          If such amount is not in fact made available to the Agent by any
          Lender, the Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand
          from such Lender together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds
          Rate for the first three (3) days from and after such demand and
          thereafter at the Base Rate then applicable to the Revolving Loans.

                    (iii)   From and after the date, if any, on which any Lender
          purchases an undivided interest and participation in any Non-Ratable
          Loan or Agent Advance pursuant to subsection (ii) above, the Agent
          shall promptly distribute to such Lender at such address as such
          Lender may request in writing, such Lender's Pro Rata Share of all
          payments of principal and interest and all proceeds of Collateral
          received by the Agent in respect of such Non-Ratable Loan or Agent
          Advance.

                    (iv)    Between Settlement Dates, the Agent, to the extent
          no Agent Advances or Non-Ratable Loans are outstanding,

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

          may pay over to the Bank any payments received by the Agent, which in
          accordance with the terms of this Agreement would be applied to the
          reduction of the Revolving Loans, for application to the Bank's
          Revolving Loans. If, as of any Settlement Date, collections received
          since the then immediately preceding Settlement Date have been applied
          to the Bank's Revolving Loans (other than to Non-Ratable Loans or
          Agent Advances in which such Lender has not yet funded its purchase of
          a participation pursuant to clause 2.2(j)(ii) above), as provided for
                                      ----------------
          in the previous sentence, the Bank shall pay to the Agent for the
          accounts of the Lenders, to be applied to the outstanding Revolving
          Loans of such Lenders, an amount such that each Lender shall, upon
          receipt of such amount, have, as of such Settlement Date, its Pro Rata
          Share of the Revolving Loans. During the period between Settlement
          Dates, the Bank with respect to Non-Ratable Loans, the Agent with
          respect to Agent Advances, and each Lender with respect to the
          Revolving Loans other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances, shall
          be entitled to interest at the applicable rate or rates payable under
          this Agreement on the actual average daily amount of funds employed by
          the Bank, the Agent and the other Lenders. Nothing in this Section
                                                                     -------
          2.2(j) is intended to impose any greater obligations on the Borrower
          ------
          to pay interest on the Loans outstanding hereunder than is otherwise
          provided for in this Agreement.

          (k)  Notation.  The Agent shall record on its books the principal
               --------
amount of the Revolving Loans owing to each Lender, including the Non-Ratable
Loans owing to the Bank, and the Agent Advances owing to the Agent, from time to
time. In addition, each Lender is authorized, at such Lender's option, to note
the date and amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Lender's
Revolving Loans in its books and records, including computer records, such books
and records constituting presumptive evidence, absent manifest error, of the
accuracy of the information contained therein.

          (l)  Lenders' Failure to Perform. All Revolving Loans (other than Non-
               ---------------------------
Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) shall be made by the Lenders simultaneously
and in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares. It is understood that (i) no
Lender shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its
obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, nor shall any Commitment of
any Lender be increased or decreased as a result of any failure by any other
Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans hereunder, (ii) no
failure by any Lender to perform its obligation to make any Revolving Loans
hereunder shall excuse any other Lender from its obligation to make any
Revolving Loans hereunder, and (iii) the obligations of each Lender hereunder
shall be several, not joint and several.

     .3  Bank Products.  The Borrower may request and the Bank may, in its sole
     -----------------
and absolute discretion, arrange for the Borrower to obtain from the Bank or the
Bank's Affiliates Bank

                                      -34-

Borrower requests the Bank to procure Bank Products, then the Borrower agrees to
indemnify and hold the Bank and the Lenders harmless from any and all
obligations now or hereafter owing to any other Person by the Bank or any of the
Lenders or the Bank's affiliates arising from or related to such Bank Products.
The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of Bank Products from
the Bank or the Bank's Affiliates (a) is in the sole and absolute discretion of
the Bank or the Bank's Affiliates, and (b) is subject to all rules and
regulations of the Bank.

Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility at such time; (ii) the maximum undrawn
amount of the requested Letter of Credit and all commissions, fees, and charges
due from the Borrower in connection with the opening thereof exceed the
Availability of the Borrower at such time; or (iii) such Letter of Credit has an
expiration date later than thirty (30) days prior to the Stated Termination Date
or more than twelve (12) months from the date of issuance.

     Issuer may prescribe, an application in form and substance satisfactory to
     such Letter of Credit Issuer and the Agent for the issuance of the Letter
     of Credit and such other documents as may be required pursuant to the terms
     thereof, and the form and terms of the proposed Letter of Credit shall be
     satisfactory to the Agent and the Letter of Credit Issuer; and

                       (2)  As of the date of issuance, no order of any court,

                     -----------------
Letter of Credit Subfacility and (B) the Availability as of such date. If (i)
the undrawn amount of the requested Letter of Credit is not greater than the
Unused Letter of Credit Subfacility and (ii) the issuance of such requested
Letter of Credit and all commissions, fees, and charges due from the Borrower in
connection with the opening thereof would not exceed the Availability of the
Borrower, the Agent shall, so long as the other conditions hereof are met, issue
or cause the Letter of Credit Issuer, if not the Bank, to issue the requested
Letter of Credit on such requested effective date of issuance.

          (3)  Notice of Issuance.  On each Settlement Date, the Agent shall
               ------------------
give notice to each Lender of the issuance of all Letters of Credit issued since

          (4)  No Extensions or Amendment.  The Agent shall not be obligated to
               --------------------------
extend or amend any Letter of Credit issued hereunder unless the requirements of
this Section 2.4 are met as though a new Letter of Credit were being requested
     -----------
and issued. With respect to any Letter of Credit which contains any "evergreen"
or automatic renewal provision, each Lender shall be deemed to have consented to
any such extension or renewal unless any such Lender shall have provided to the
Agent, not less than 30 days prior to the last date on which the applicable
issuer can in accordance with the terms of the applicable Letter of Credit
decline to extend or renew such Letter of Credit, written notice that it
declines to consent to any such extension or renewal; provided, that if all of
the requirements of this Section 2.4 are met and no Default or Event of Default
                         -----------
exists, no Lender shall decline to consent to any such extension or renewal.

          (1)  Payment of Letter of Credit Obligations.  The Borrower agrees to
               ---------------------------------------
reimburse immediately the Letter of Credit Issuer for any draw under any Letter
of Credit and the Agent for the account of the Lenders upon any payment pursuant
to any Credit Support immediately upon demand, and to pay the Letter of Credit
Issuer the amount of all other obligations and other amounts payable to such
Letter of Credit Issuer under or in connection with any Letter of Credit
immediately when due, irrespective of any claim, setoff, defense or other right
which the Borrower may have at any time against such issuer or any other Person.

          (2)  Revolving Loans to Satisfy Reimbursement Obligations.  In the
               ------------------------------------------------------
event that the Letter of Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit honors a draw
under such Letter of Credit or the Agent shall have made any payment pursuant to
any Credit Support and the Borrower shall not have repaid such amount to the
Letter of Credit Issuer of such Letter of Credit or the Agent, as applicable,
pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(1), the Agent shall, upon receiving notice of such
            ----------------
failure, notify each Lender of such failure, and each Lender shall
unconditionally pay to the Agent, for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer
or the Agent, as applicable, as and when provided hereinbelow, an amount equal
to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the amount of such payment in Dollars and in
same day funds. If the Agent so notifies the Lenders prior to 12:00 noon
(Pasadena, California time) on any Business Day, each Lender shall make
available to the Agent the amount of such payment, as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, on such Business Day. Such amounts paid by the
Lenders to the Agent shall constitute Revolving Loans which shall be deemed to
have been requested by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2 as set forth in
                                                -----------

                                    --------------
to have irrevocably and unconditionally purchased and received without recourse
or warranty, an undivided interest and participation equal to such Lender's Pro
Rata Share of the face amount of such Letter of Credit or the Credit Support
provided through the Agent to the Letter of Credit Issuer, if not the Agent, in
connection with the issuance of such Letter of Credit (including all obligations
of the Borrower with respect thereto, and any security therefor or guaranty
pertaining thereto).

          (2)  Sharing of Reimbursement Obligation Payments.  Whenever the Agent
               --------------------------------------------
receives a payment from the Borrower on account of reimbursement obligations in
respect of a Letter of Credit or Credit Support as to which the Agent has
previously received for the account of the Letter of Credit Issuer thereof
payment from a Lender pursuant to Section 2.4(e)(2), the Agent shall promptly
                                  -----------------
pay to such Lender such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such payment from the
Borrower in Dollars. Each such payment shall be made by the Agent on the
Business Day on which the Agent receives

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

immediately available funds paid to such Person pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, if received prior to 1:00 p.m. (Pasadena, California time)
on such Business Day and otherwise on the next succeeding Business Day.

          (3)  Documentation.  Upon the request of any Lender, the Agent shall
               -------------
furnish to such Lender copies of any Letter of Credit, reimbursement agreements
executed in connection therewith, application for any Letter of Credit and
credit support or enhancement provided through the Agent in connection with the
issuance of any Letter of Credit, and such other documentation as may reasonably
be requested by such Lender.

          (4)  Obligations Irrevocable.  The obligations of each Lender to make
               ------------------------
payments to the Agent with respect to any Letter of Credit or with respect to
any Credit Support provided through the Agent with respect to a Letter of
Credit, and the obligations of the Borrower to make payments to the Agent, for
the account of the Lenders, shall be irrevocable, not subject to any
qualification or exception whatsoever, including any of the following
circumstances:

              (i)  any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
     any of the other Loan Documents;

              (ii) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other right

     issuer of such Letter of Credit, or any other Person, whether in connection
     with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the transactions contemplated
     herein or any unrelated transactions (including any underlying transactions
     between the Borrower or any other Person and the beneficiary named in any
     Letter of Credit);

              (iii)  any draft, certificate or any other document presented
     under the Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
     insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
     inaccurate in any respect;

              (iv) the surrender or impairment of any security for the
     performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Loan Documents;
     or

              (v)  the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

     (g)  Recovery or Avoidance of Payments.  In the event any payment by or on
          ----------------------------------
behalf of the Borrower received by the Agent with respect to any Letter of
Credit or Credit Support provided for any Letter of Credit and distributed by
the Agent to the Lenders on account of their respective participations therein
is thereafter set aside, avoided or recovered from the Agent in connection with
any receivership, liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, the Lenders shall, upon
demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent their respective Pro Rata Shares of such

                                      -38-

                                                                       --------
3.6.
- ---

          (2)  Issuer Fees and Charges.  The Borrower shall pay to the Letter of
               -----------------------
Credit Issuer of any Letter of Credit, or to the Agent for the account of the
Letter of Credit Issuer of any such Letter of Credit, solely for such Letter of
Credit Issuer's account, such fees and other charges as are charged by such
Letter of Credit Issuer for letters of credit issued by it, including its

canceling letters of credit and all other fees associated with issuing or
servicing letters of credit, as and when assessed.

     (i)  Indemnification; Exoneration; Power of Attorney.
          -----------------------------------------------

          (1)  Indemnification.  In addition to amounts payable as elsewhere
               ---------------
provided in this Section 2.4, in Section 15.11 and pursuant to any indemnity
                 -----------     -------------
agreement contained in any letter of credit agreement between the Borrower and
any Letter of Credit Issuer (whether now existing or hereafter arising), the
Borrower hereby agrees to protect, indemnify, pay and save the Lenders and the
Agent harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities,
damages, losses, costs, charges and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) which any Lender or the Agent (other than the Agent in its capacity as
Letter of Credit Issuer) may incur or be subject to as a consequence, direct or
indirect, of the issuance of any Letter of Credit or the provision of any credit
support or enhancement in connection therewith. The agreement in this Section
                                                                      -------
2.4(i)(1) shall survive payment of all Obligations. Nothing contained in this
- ---------
Agreement is intended to limit or waive the Borrower's rights, if any, with
respect to the Letter of Credit Issuer which arise by operation of law or as a
result of the letter of credit application and related documents executed by and
between the Borrower and the Letter of Credit Issuer.

          (2)  Assumption of Risk by the Borrower.  As among the Borrower, the
               ----------------------------------
Lenders, and the Agent, the Borrower assumes all risks of the acts and omissions
of, or misuse of any of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries
of such Letters of Credit. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Lenders and the Agent shall not be responsible for: (A) the form,
validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document
submitted by any Person in connection with the application for and issuance of
and presentation of drafts with respect to any of the Letters of Credit, even if
it should prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate,
fraudulent or forged; (B) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any Letter of
Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in
part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (C) the
failure of the beneficiary of any Letter of

causes beyond the control of the Lenders or the Agent, including any act or
omission, whether rightful or wrongful, of any present or future de jure or de
                                                                 -- ---- -- --
facto Governmental Authority. None of the foregoing shall affect, impair or
- -----
prevent the vesting of any rights or powers of the Agent or any Lender under
this Section 2.4(i).
     --------------

          (3) Exoneration. In furtherance and extension, and not in limitation,
              -----------
of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the
Agent or any Lender under or in connection with any of the Letters of Credit or
any related certificates, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the
Agent or any Lender under any resulting liability to the Borrower or relieve the
Borrower of any of its obligations hereunder to any such Person.

          (4)  Indemnification by Lenders.  The Lenders agree to indemnify the
               --------------------------
Letter of Credit Issuer (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and
without limiting the obligations of Borrower hereunder) ratably in accordance
with their respective Pro Rata Shares, for any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses
(including attorneys' fees) or disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever
that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Letter of Credit
Issuer in any way relating to or arising out of any Letter of Credit or the
transactions contemplated thereby or any action taken or omitted by the Letter
of Credit Issuer under any Letter of Credit or any Loan Document in connection
therewith; provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to
           --------
the extent it arises from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
person to be indemnified. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender
agrees to reimburse the Letter of Credit Issuer promptly upon demand for its Pro
Rata Share of any costs or expenses payable by Borrower to the Letter of Credit
Issuer, to the extent that the Letter of Credit Issuer is not promptly
reimbursed for such costs and expenses by Borrower. The agreement contained in
this section shall survive payment in full of all Obligations.

          (5)  Account Party.  The Borrower hereby authorizes and directs any
               -------------
Letter of Credit Issuer to name the Borrower as the "Account Party" therein and
to deliver to the Agent all instruments, documents and other writings and
property received by the Letter of Credit Issuer pursuant to the Letter of
Credit, and to accept and rely upon the Agent's instructions and agreements with
respect to all matters arising in connection with the Letter of Credit or the
application therefor.

     (j)  Supporting Letter of Credit; Cash Collateral.  If, notwithstanding the
          --------------------------------------------
provisions of Section 2.4(b) and Section 12.1 any Letter of Credit is
              --------------     ------------
outstanding upon the termination of this Agreement, then upon such termination
the Borrower shall deposit with the Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Agent
and the Lenders, with respect to each Letter of Credit then outstanding, as the
Majority Lenders, in their discretion shall specify, either (A) a standby letter
of credit (a "Supporting Letter of Credit") in form and substance satisfactory
to the Agent, issued by an issuer satisfactory to the Agent in an amount equal
to the greatest amount for which such Letter of Credit may be drawn plus any
fees and expenses associated with such Letter of Credit, under which Supporting
Letter of Credit the Agent is entitled to draw amounts necessary to reimburse
the Agent and the Lenders for payments to be made by the Agent and the Lenders
under such Letter of Credit or under any credit support or enhancement provided
through the Agent with respect thereto and any fees and expenses associated with
such Letter of Credit, or (B) cash in amounts necessary to reimburse the Agent
and the Lenders for payments made by the Agent or the Lenders under such Letter
of Credit or under any credit support or enhancement provided through the Agent
with respect thereto and any fees and expenses associated with such Letter of
Credit. Such Supporting Letter of Credit or deposit of cash shall be held by the
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, as security for,
and to provide for the payment of, the aggregate undrawn amount of such Letters
of Credit remaining outstanding.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                                   ---------

                               INTEREST AND FEES
                               -----------------
      .1  Interest.
      ------------

          (a)  Interest Rates.  All outstanding Obligations shall bear interest
               --------------
on the unpaid principal amount thereof (including, to the extent permitted by
law, on interest thereon not paid when due) from the date made until paid in
full in cash at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate or the LIBOR
Rate and Sections 3.1(a)(i) or (ii), as applicable, but not to exceed the
         -----------------     ----
Maximum Rate described in Section 3.3. Subject to the provisions of Section 3.2,
                          -----------                               -----------
any of the Loans may be converted into, or continued as, Base Rate Loans or
LIBOR Rate Loans in the manner provided in Section 3.2. If at any time Loans are
                                           -----------
outstanding with respect to which notice has not been delivered to the Agent in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement specifying the basis for determining
the interest rate applicable thereto, then those Loans shall be Base Rate Loans
and shall bear interest at a rate determined by reference to the Base Rate until
notice to the contrary has been given to the Agent in accordance with this
Agreement and such notice has become effective. Except as otherwise provided
herein, the outstanding Obligations shall bear interest as follows:

              (i) For all Base Rate Loans and other Obligations (other than
     LIBOR Rate Loans) at a fluctuating per annum rate equal to the Base Rate
     plus the Applicable Margin; and

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

              (ii) For all LIBOR Rate Loans at a per annum rate equal to the
     LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
                ----

Each change in the Base Rate shall be reflected in the interest rate described
in clause (i) above as of the effective date of such change.  All interest
charges shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days
elapsed (which results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis
of a 365-day year).  Interest accrued on all Loans will be payable in arrears on
the first day of each month hereafter.

          (b)  Default Rate.  If any Default or Event of Default occurs and is
               ------------
continuing and the Majority Lenders in their discretion so elect, then, while
any such Default or Event of Default is outstanding, all of the Obligations
shall bear interest at the Default Rate applicable thereto.

      .2  Conversion and Continuation Elections. (a) The Borrower may, upon
      ------------------------------------------
irrevocable written notice to the Agent in accordance with Section 3.2(b):

              (i) elect, as of any Business Day, in the case of Base Rate Loans
     to convert any such Loans (or any part thereof in an amount not less than
     $5,000,000, or that is in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
     thereof) into LIBOR Rate Loans; or

              (ii) elect, as of the last day of the applicable Interest Period,
     to continue any LIBOR Rate Loans having Interest Periods expiring on such
     day (or any part thereof in an amount not less than $5,000,000, or that is
     in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof);

provided, that if at any time the aggregate amount of LIBOR Rate Loans in
- --------
respect of any Borrowing is reduced, by payment, prepayment, or conversion of
part thereof to be less than $5,000,000, such LIBOR Rate Loans shall
automatically convert into Base Rate Loans, and on and after such date the right
of the Borrower to continue such Loans as, and convert such Loans into, LIBOR
Rate Loans, as the case may be, shall terminate.

          (b) The Borrower shall deliver a notice of conversion/continuation in
the form of Exhibit C ("Notice of Conversion/Continuation") to be received by
            ---------
the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (Pasadena, California time) at least three
Business Days in advance of the Conversion/Continuation Date, if the Loans are
to be converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans and specifying:

              (i)  the applicable Borrower;

              (ii) the proposed Conversion/Continuation Date;

              (iii)  the aggregate amount of Loans to be converted or renewed;

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

               (iv) the type of Loans resulting from the proposed conversion or
     continuation; and

               (v)  the duration of the requested Interest Period.

          (c) If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to LIBOR
Rate Loans, the Borrower has failed to select timely a new Interest Period to be
applicable to LIBOR Rate Loans or if any Default or Event of Default then
exists, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such LIBOR Rate
Loans into Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such Interest
Period.

          (d) The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of a
Notice of Conversion/Continuation.  All conversions and continuations shall be
made ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the
Loans with respect to which the notice was given held by each Lender.

          (e) During the existence of a Default or Event of Default, the
Borrower may not elect to have a Loan converted into or continued as a LIBOR
Rate Loan.

          (f) After giving effect to any conversion or continuation of Loans,
there may not be more than five different Interest Periods in effect hereunder.

     .3  Maximum Interest Rate.  In no event shall any interest rate provided
     -------------------------
for hereunder exceed the maximum rate legally chargeable by any Lender under
applicable law for such Lender with respect to loans of the type provided for
hereunder (the "Maximum Rate"). If, in any month, any interest rate, absent such
limitation, would have exceeded the Maximum Rate, then the interest rate for
that month shall be the Maximum Rate, and, if in future months, that interest
rate would otherwise be less than the Maximum Rate, then that interest rate
shall remain at the Maximum Rate until such time as the amount of interest paid
hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been paid if the same
had not been limited by the Maximum Rate. In the event that, upon payment in
full of the Obligations, the total amount of interest paid or accrued under the
terms of this Agreement is less than the total amount of interest which would,
but for this Section 3.3, have been paid or accrued if the interest rates
             -----------
otherwise set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then the
Borrower shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, pay the Agent, for
the account of the Lenders, an amount equal to the excess of (a) the lesser of
(i) the amount of interest which would have been charged if the Maximum Rate
had, at all times, been in effect or (ii) the amount of interest which would
have accrued had the interest rates otherwise set forth in this Agreement, at
all times, been in effect over (b) the amount of interest actually paid or
accrued under this Agreement. In the event that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Agent and/or any Lender has received interest
and other charges hereunder in excess of the Maximum Rate, such excess shall be
deemed received on account of, and shall automatically be applied to reduce, the
Obligations other than interest, in the inverse order of maturity, and if there
are no Obligations outstanding, the Agent and/or such Lender shall refund to the
Borrower such excess.

                                      -43-

     .4  Arrangement Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay the Agent, for the account
     -------------------
of the Agent and for the account of the Lenders in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Shares, an arrangement fee (the "Arrangement Fee") as
required by the Fee Letter, which Arrangement Fee shall be fully earned by the
Agent and the Lenders when due as provided in the Fee Letter.

     .5  Unused Line Fee.  Until the Loans have been paid in full and the
     -------------------
Agreement terminated, the Borrower agrees to pay, on the first day of each month
and on the Termination Date, to the Agent, for the account of the Lenders, in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, an unused line fee (the
"Unused Line Fee") equal to the Applicable Fee Amount times the amount by which
the Maximum Revolver Amount exceeded the sum of the average daily outstanding
amount of Revolving Loans and the average daily undrawn face amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit during the immediately preceding month, or shorter
period if calculated on the Termination Date. The Unused Line Fee shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed
and shall accrue at all times from and after (but not prior to) the Loan
Availability Date. All payments received by the Agent on account of Accounts or
as proceeds of other Collateral shall be deemed to be credited to the Loan
Account immediately upon receipt for purposes of calculating the Unused Line Fee
pursuant to this Section 3.5.
                 -----------

     .6  Letter of Credit Fee.  The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for
     ------------------------
the account of the Lenders, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares,
for each Letter of Credit, a fee (the "Letter of Credit Fee") equal to the
Applicable Fee Amount times the undrawn face amount of each Letter of Credit,
plus all out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Agent in
- ----
connection with the application for, processing of, issuance of, or amendment to
any Letter of Credit, which costs, fees and expenses could include a "fronting
fee" payable to such issuer; The Letter of Credit Fee shall be payable monthly
in arrears on the first day of each month following any month in which a Letter

herein, all payments by the Borrower shall be made to the
Agent for the account of the Lenders at the Agent's address set forth in Section
                                                                         -------
15.8, and shall be made in Dollars and in immediately available funds, no later
- ----
than 1:00 p.m. (Pasadena, California time) on the date specified herein. Any
payment received by the Agent later than 1:00 p.m. (Pasadena, California time)
shall be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any
applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

          (b)  Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of
"Interest Period" herein, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and such
extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest
or fees, as the case may be.

          (c)  Unless the Agent receives notice from the Borrower prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Lenders that the Borrower will not make
such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately
available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance
upon such assumption, distribute to each Lender on such due date an amount equal
to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower has not
made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent on
demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon at
the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to
such Lender until the date repaid.

      .4   Payments as Revolving Loans. All payments of principal, interest,
      --------------------------------
reimbursement obligations in connection with Letters of Credit, fees, premiums
and other sums payable hereunder, including all reimbursement for expenses
pursuant to Section 15.7, may, at the option of the Agent, in its sole
            ------------
discretion, subject only to the terms of this Section 4.4, be paid from the
                                              -----------
proceeds of Revolving Loans made hereunder, whether made following a request by
the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2 or a deemed request as provided in this
                         -------
Section 4.4. The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Agent to charge the
- -----------
Loan Account for the purpose of paying principal, interest, reimbursement
obligations in connection with Letters of Credit, fees, premiums and other sums
payable hereunder, including reimbursing expenses pursuant to Section 15.7, and
                                                              ------------
agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Revolving Loans (including
Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) and that all such Revolving Loans so made
shall be deemed to have been requested by Borrower pursuant to Section 2.2.

      .5  Apportionment, Application and Reversal of Payments. Aggregate
      -------------------------------------------------------
principal and interest payments shall be apportioned ratably among the Lenders
(according to the unpaid principal balance of the Loans to which such payments
relate held by each Lender) and payments of the fees shall, as applicable, be
apportioned ratably among the Lenders. All payments shall be remitted to the
Agent and all such payments not relating to principal or interest of specific
Loans, or not constituting payment of specific fees, and all proceeds of
Accounts or other Collateral received by the Agent, shall be applied, ratably,
subject to the provisions of this Agreement, first, to pay any fees, indemnities
                                             -----
or expense reimbursements then due to the Agent from the Borrower; second, to

pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the
Borrower; third, to pay interest due in respect of all Revolving Loans,
          -----
including Non-Ratable

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

Loans and Agent Advances; fourth, to pay or prepay principal of the Non-Ratable
                          ------
Loans and Agent Advances; fifth, to pay or prepay principal of the Revolving
                          -----
Loans (other than Non-Ratable Loans and Agent Advances) and unpaid reimbursement
obligations in respect of Letters of Credit; sixth to any amounts owing under
                                             -----
any Bank Product; and seventh, to the payment of any other Obligation due to the
                      -------
Agent or any Lender by the Borrower. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrower, or unless an
Event of Default is outstanding, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall apply
any payments which it receives to any LIBOR Rate Loan, except (a) on the
expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such LIBOR Rate Loan,
or (b) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding Base
Rate Loans. The Agent shall promptly distribute to each Lender, pursuant to the
applicable wire transfer instructions received from each Lender in writing, such
funds as it may be entitled to receive, subject to a Settlement delay as
provided for in Section 2.2(j). The Agent and the Lenders shall have the
                --------------
continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such
proceeds and payments to any portion of the Obligations.

      .6 Indemnity for Returned Payments. If, after receipt of any payment of,
      ----------------------------------
or proceeds applied to the payment of, all or any part of the Obligations, the
Agent or any Lender is for any reason compelled to surrender such payment or
proceeds to any Person, because such payment or application of proceeds is
invalidated, declared fraudulent, set aside, determined to be void or voidable
as a preference, impermissible setoff, or a diversion of trust funds, or for any
other reason, then the Obligations or part thereof intended to be satisfied
shall be revived and continue and this Agreement shall continue in full force as
if such payment or proceeds had not been received by the Agent or such Lender,
and the Borrower shall be liable to pay to the Agent, and hereby does indemnify
the Agent and the Lenders and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless for, the
amount of such payment or proceeds surrendered. The provisions of this Section
                                                                       -------
4.6 shall be and remain effective notwithstanding any contrary action which may
- ---
have been taken by the Agent or any Lender in reliance upon such payment or
application of proceeds, and any such contrary action so taken shall be without
prejudice to the Agent's and the Lenders' rights under this Agreement and shall
be deemed to have been conditioned upon such payment or application of proceeds
having become final and irrevocable. The provisions of this Section 4.6 shall
                                                            -----------
survive the termination of this Agreement.

      .7  Agent's and Lenders' Books and Records; Monthly Statements.  The
      --------------------------------------------------------------
Borrower agrees that the Agent's and each Lender's books and records showing the
Obligations and the transactions pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be admissible in any action or proceeding arising therefrom, and
shall constitute rebuttably presumptive proof thereof, irrespective of whether
any Obligation is also evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument. The
Agent will provide to the Borrower a monthly statement of Loans, payments, and
other transactions pursuant to this Agreement. Such statement shall be deemed
correct, accurate, and binding on the Borrower and an account stated (except for
reversals and reapplications of payments made as provided in Section 4.5 and
                                                             -----------
corrections of errors discovered by the Agent), unless the Borrower notifies the
Agent in writing to the contrary within thirty (30) days after such statement is
rendered. In the event a timely written notice of objections is given

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

by the Borrower, only the items to which exception is expressly made will be
considered to be disputed by the Borrower.

                                   ---------

                     TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
                     --------------------------------------

      .1  Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to each Lender or the
      ---------
Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. In addition, the
Borrower shall pay all Other Taxes.

          (b)  The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender
and the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including any Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section) paid by the Lender or the Agent and any liability (including penalties,
interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30 days after
the date the Lender or the Agent makes written demand therefor.

          (c)  If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold
any Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any
Lender or the Agent, then:

              (i)  the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after
     making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions and
     withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such
     Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the
     sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been
     made;

              (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;

              (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
     to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with
     applicable law; and

              (iv) the Borrower shall also pay to each Lender or the Agent for
     the account of such Lender, at the time interest is paid, all additional
     amounts which the respective Lender specifies as necessary to preserve the
     after-tax yield the Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes
     had not been imposed.

          (d)  Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Borrower of
Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish the Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to the Agent.

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

          (e)  If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to any
Lender or the Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, then such Lender
shall use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions)
to change the jurisdiction of its lending office so as to eliminate any such
additional payment by the Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such change
in the judgment of such Lender is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

     .2  Illegality. (a) If any Lender determines that the introduction of any
     --------------
Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the
interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it
unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted
that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make
LIBOR Rate Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Lender to the Borrower through
the Agent, any obligation of that Lender to make LIBOR Rate Loans shall be
suspended until the Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.

          (b)  If a Lender determines that it is unlawful to maintain any LIBOR
Rate Loan, the Borrower shall, upon its receipt of notice of such fact and
demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent), prepay in full such LIBOR
Rate Loans of that Lender then outstanding, together with interest accrued
thereon and amounts required under Section 5.4, either on the last day of the
                                   -----------
Interest Period thereof, if the Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loan. If the Borrower is required to so
prepay any LIBOR Rate Loan, then concurrently with such prepayment, the Borrower
may, at its option, borrow from the affected Lender, in the amount of such
repayment, a Base Rate Loan.

     .3  Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. (a) If any Lender determines
     -------------------------------------------
that, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in the interpretation
of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance by that Lender with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to such Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any
LIBOR Rate Loans, or agreeing to issue, issuing, funding or maintaining any
Letter of Credit, then the Borrower shall be liable for, and shall from time to
time, upon demand (with a copy of such demand to be sent to the Agent), pay to
the Agent for the account of such Lender, additional amounts as are sufficient
to compensate such Lender for such increased costs.

          (b)  If any Lender shall have determined that (i) the introduction of
any Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy
Regulation, (iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any
Capital Adequacy Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by
the Lender or any corporation or other entity controlling the Lender with any
Capital Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by the Lender or any corporation or other
entity controlling the Lender and (taking into consideration such Lender's or
such corporation's or other entity's policies with respect to capital adequacy
and such Lender's desired return on capital) determines that the amount of such
capital is increased as a consequence of its Commitments, loans, credits or

                                      -49-
<PAGE>

obligations under this Agreement, then, upon demand of such Lender to the
Borrower through the Agent, the Borrower shall pay to the Lender, from time to
time as specified by the Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate the
Lender for such increase.

     .4  Funding Losses.  The Borrower shall reimburse each Lender and hold each
     ------------------
Lender harmless from any loss or expense which the Lender may sustain or incur
as a consequence of:

          (a)  the failure of the Borrower to make on a timely basis any payment
of principal of any LIBOR Rate Loan;

          (b) the failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Loan
after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing
or a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation;

          (c) the prepayment or other payment (including after acceleration
thereof) of an LIBOR Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant
Interest Period;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its LIBOR Rate Loans or from fees payable to
terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.

     .5  Inability to Determine Rates.  If the Agent determines that for any
     --------------------------------
reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan, or
that the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the Lenders
of funding such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each
Lender. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate
Loans hereunder shall be suspended until the Agent revokes such notice in
writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation then submitted by it. If the
Borrower does not revoke such Notice, the Lenders shall make, convert or
continue the Loans, as proposed by the Borrower, in the amount specified in the
applicable notice submitted by the Borrower, but such Loans shall be made,
converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of LIBOR Rate Loans.

      .6  Certificates of Lenders.  Any Lender claiming reimbursement or
      ---------------------------
compensation under this Article 5 shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to
the Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount payable
to the Lender hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and binding on
the Borrower in the absence of manifest error.

     .7  Survival.  The agreements and obligations of the Borrower in this

      .1  Grant of Security Interest. (a) As security for all Obligations, the
      ------------------------------
Borrower hereby grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Agent and the
Lenders, a continuing security interest in, lien on, assignment of and right of
set-off against, all of the following property and assets of the Borrower,
whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising, regardless of
where located:

              (i)   all Accounts (including any credit enhancement therefor);

              (ii)  all Inventory;

              (iii) all chattel paper, instruments and documents;

              (iv)  all General Intangibles;

              (v)  all money, cash, cash equivalents, securities and other
     property of any kind of the Borrower held directly or indirectly by the
     Agent or any Lender;

              (vi) all of the Borrower's deposit accounts, credits, and balances
     with and other claims against the Agent or any Lender or any of their
     Affiliates, including any Payment Account;

              (vii) all books, records and other property related to or
     referring to any of the foregoing, including books, records, account
     ledgers, data processing records, computer software and other property and
     General Intangibles at any time evidencing or relating to any of the
     foregoing; and

              (viii) all accessions to, substitutions for and replacements,
     products and proceeds of any of the foregoing, including, but not limited
     to, proceeds of any insurance policies and claims against third parties
     with respect to all or any of the foregoing.

All of the foregoing and all other property of the Borrower in which the Agent
or any Lender may at any time be granted a Lien, is herein collectively referred
to as the "Collateral."  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.1, such grant of a security interest shall not extend to, and the term
- -----------
"Collateral" shall not include, any General Intangibles of the Borrower
consisting of licenses, leases or other contracts or any Accounts payable to the
Parent by the German Subsidiary (such Accounts, the "German Subsidiary
Accounts"), to the extent that (i) such General Intangibles or German Subsidiary
Accounts are not assignable or capable of

                                      -51-
<PAGE>

being encumbered as a matter of law or under the terms of the license, lease or
other agreement applicable thereto (but solely to the extent that any such
restriction shall be enforceable under applicable law), without the consent of
the licensor or lessor thereof or other applicable party thereto and (ii) such
consent has not been obtained; provided, however, that the foregoing
                               --------  -------
grant of security interest shall extend to, and the term "Collateral" shall
include (but subject to the exclusions from the definition of General
Intangibles set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of such definition), (A) any
General Intangible which is a proceed of, or otherwise related to the
enforcement or collection of, any Account (other than any German Subsidiary
Account which is excludable as provided above), (B) any and all proceeds of any
General Intangibles and of the German Subsidiary Accounts which are otherwise
excluded to the extent that the assignment or encumbrance of such proceeds is
not so restricted, and (C) upon obtaining the consent of any such licensor,
lessor or other applicable party with respect to any such otherwise excluded
General Intangibles or German Subsidiary Accounts (it being understood by the
parties that the Borrower shall be under no obligation hereunder to obtain any
such consent), such General Intangibles and German Subsidiary Accounts, as well
as any and all proceeds thereof, that might have theretofore have been excluded
from such grant of a security interest and the term "Collateral."

          (b)  All of the Obligations shall be secured by all of the Collateral.

     .2  Perfection and Protection of Security Interest. (a) The Borrower shall,
     --------------------------------------------------
at its expense, perform all steps requested by the Agent at any time to perfect,
maintain, protect, and enforce the Agent's Liens, including: (i) executing and
filing financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereof, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agent; (ii) delivering to the Agent the originals
of all instruments, documents, and chattel paper, and all other Collateral of
which the Agent determines it should have physical possession in order to
perfect and protect the Agent's security interest therein, duly pledged,
endorsed or assigned to the Agent without restriction; (iii) delivering to the
Agent warehouse receipts covering any portion of the Collateral located in
warehouses and for which warehouse receipts are issued and certificates of title
covering any portion of the collateral for which certificates of title have been
issued; (iv) when an Event of Default exists, transferring Inventory to
warehouses designated by the Agent; (v) placing notations on the Borrower's
books of account to disclose the Agent's security interest; (vii) delivering to
the Agent all letters of credit on which the Borrower is named beneficiary; and
(viii) taking such other steps as are reasonably deemed necessary or desirable
by the Agent to maintain and protect the Agent's Liens. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, the Agent may file, without the Borrower's signature, one or
more financing statements disclosing the Agent's Liens. The Borrower agrees that
a carbon, photographic, photostatic, or other reproduction of this Agreement or
of a financing statement is sufficient as a financing statement.

          (b)  If any Collateral is at any time in the possession or control of
any warehouseman, bailee or any of the Borrower's agents or processors, then the
Borrower shall notify the Agent thereof and shall, at the request of Agent,
notify such Person of the Agent's security interest in such Collateral and
instruct such Person to hold all such Collateral for the Agent's account subject
to the Agent's instructions. If at any time any Collateral is located on any
operating facility of the Borrower which is not owned by the Borrower, then the
Borrower

                                      -52-
<PAGE>

shall, at the request of the Agent, obtain written subordinations, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Agent, of all present and future Liens to which
the owner or lessor of such premises may be entitled to assert against the
Collateral.

          (c)  From time to time, the Borrower shall, upon the Agent's request,
execute and deliver confirmatory written instruments pledging to the Agent, for
the ratable benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, the Collateral with respect to
the Borrower, but the Borrower's failure to do so shall not affect or limit any
security interest or any other rights of the Agent or any Lender in and to the
Collateral with respect to the Borrower. So long as this Agreement is in effect
and until all Obligations have been fully satisfied, the Agent's Liens shall
continue in full force and effect in all Collateral (whether or not deemed
eligible for the purpose of calculating the Availability or as the basis for any
advance, loan, extension of credit, or other financial accommodation).

     .3  Location of Collateral.  The Borrower represents and warrants to the
     --------------------------
Agent and the Lenders that: (a) Schedule 6.3 is a correct and complete list of
                                ------------
the Borrower's chief executive office, the location of its books and records and
the locations of the Collateral; and (b) Schedule 6.3 correctly identifies any
                                         ------------
of such facilities and locations that are not owned by the Borrower. The
Borrower covenants and agrees that it will not (i) maintain any Collateral at
any location other than those locations listed for the Borrower on Schedule 6.3,
                                                                   ------------
(ii) otherwise change or add to any of such locations, or (iii) change the
location of its chief executive office from the location identified
in Schedule 6.3, unless it gives the Agent at least thirty (30) days' prior
   ------------
written notice thereof and executes any and all financing statements and other
documents that the Agent reasonably requests in connection therewith. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Borrower represents that all of its Inventory (other
than Inventory in transit) is, and covenants that all of its Inventory will be,
located either (a) on premises owned by the Borrower, (b) on premises leased by
the Borrower, provided that the Agent has, if reasonably requested by the Agent,
received an executed landlord waiver from the landlord of such premises in form
and substance satisfactory to the Agent, or (c) in a warehouse or with a bailee,
provided that the Agent has, if reasonably requested by the Agent, received an
executed bailee letter from the applicable Person in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

     .4  Title to, Liens on, and Sale and Use of Collateral. The Borrower
     ------------------------------------------------------
represents and warrants to the Agent and the Lenders and agrees with the Agent
and the Lenders that: (a) all of the Collateral is and will continue to be owned
by the Borrower free and clear of all Liens whatsoever, except for Permitted
Liens; (b) the Agent's Liens in the Collateral will not be subject to any prior
Lien; (c) the Borrower will use, store, and maintain the Collateral with all
reasonable care and will use such Collateral for lawful purposes only; and (d)
the Borrower will not, without the Agent's prior written approval, sell, or
dispose of or permit the sale or disposition of any of the Collateral except for
sales for scrap of excess or no-movement Inventory and other Inventory in the
ordinary course of business. The inclusion of proceeds in the Collateral shall
not be deemed to constitute the Agent's or any Lender's consent to any sale or
other disposition of the Collateral except as expressly permitted herein.

                                      -53-
<PAGE>

     .5  Appraisals.  Whenever an Event of Default exists, and at such other
     --------------
times not more frequently than once a year as the Agent requests, the Borrower
shall, at its expense and upon the Agent's request, provide the Agent with
appraisals or updates thereof of any or all of the Collateral from an appraiser,
and prepared on a basis, reasonably satisfactory to the Agent, such appraisals
and updates to include, without limitation, information required by applicable
law and regulation and by the internal policies of the Lenders.

     .6  Access and Examination; Confidentiality. (a)  The Agent, accompanied by
     -------------------------------------------
any Lender which so elects, may, at Borrower's expense, at all reasonable times
during regular business hours (and at any time when an Event of Default exists
and is continuing) have access to, examine, audit, make extracts from or copies
of and inspect any or all of the Borrower's records, files, and books of account
and the Collateral, and discuss the Borrower's affairs with the Borrower's
officers and management; provided that the Agent and the Lenders agree that,
                         --------
unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent shall not
conduct any such examination, audit or other inspection more than (i) two times
in any calendar year at any time prior to the first date, if any, on which the
Loan to Availability Ratio is equal to or greater than 50% for fifteen (15)
consecutive days (such date, a "Trigger Date") and (ii) four times in any
calendar year at any time thereafter; provided, further, that if after any
                                      --------  -------
Trigger Date the Loan to Availability Ratio is less than 50% for 120 consecutive
days (such 120th day, a "Shut-Off Date") then, from and after such Shut-Off
Date, the Agent and the Lenders agree that, unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Agent shall not conduct any such examination,
audit or other inspection more than (x) two times during the portion of the
calendar year then remaining after such Shut-Off Date (and in no event more than
four times in all of such calendar year) and in any calendar year thereafter
until the next Trigger Date, if any, and (y) four times in any calendar year at
any time thereafter until the next Shut-Off Date, if any. The parties agree that
the immediately preceding proviso shall govern the permitted frequency of
examinations, audits and other inspections conducted by the Agent pursuant to
this Section 6.6 in respect of each subsequent Trigger Date and Shut-Off Date
occurring thereafter. The parties further agree that the Agent may conduct
additional examinations, audits or other inspections, at the expense of the
Agent and the Lenders, at all reasonable times during regular business hours, in
addition to those contemplated above in this Section 6.6. The Borrower will
                                             -----------
deliver to the Agent any instrument necessary for the Agent to obtain records
from any service bureau maintaining records for the Borrower. The Agent may, and
at the direction of the Majority Lenders shall, at any time when a Default or
Event of Default exists, and at the Borrower's expense, make copies of all of
the Borrower's books and records relating to the Collateral and all relevant
financial records, or require the Borrower to deliver such copies to the Agent.
The Agent may, without expense to the Agent, use such of the Borrower's
respective personnel, supplies, and premises as may be reasonably necessary for
maintaining or enforcing the Agent's Liens. The Agent shall have the right, at
any time, in the Agent's name or in the name of a nominee of the Agent, to
verify the validity, amount or any other matter relating to the Accounts,
Inventory, or other Collateral, by mail, telephone, or otherwise.

          (b)  The Borrower agrees that, subject to the Borrower's prior consent
for uses other than in a traditional tombstone, the Agent and each Lender may
use the Borrower's name in advertising and promotional material and in
conjunction therewith disclose the general terms

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

of this Agreement. The Agent and each Lender severally agree to take
commercially reasonable precautions and exercise due care to maintain the
confidentiality of all information identified as "confidential" or "secret" by
the Borrower and provided to the Agent or such Lender by or on behalf of the
Borrower, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither the
Agent, nor such Lender nor any of their respective Affiliates shall use any such
information other than in connection with or in enforcement of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents, except to the extent that such information (i) was
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
disclosure by the Agent or such Lender, or (ii) was or becomes available on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Borrower, provided that such
source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Borrower known to
the Agent or such Lender; provided, however, that the Agent and any Lender may
                          --------  ------
disclose such information (1) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of
any Governmental Authority to which the Agent or such Lender is subject or in
connection with an examination of the Agent or such Lender by any such
Governmental Authority; (2) pursuant to subpoena or other court process; (3)
when required to do so in accordance with the provisions of any applicable
Requirement of Law; (4) to the extent reasonably required in connection with any
litigation or proceeding (including, but not limited to, any bankruptcy
proceeding) to which the Agent, any Lender or their respective Affiliates may be
party; (5) to the extent reasonably required in connection with the exercise of
any remedy hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (6) to the Agent's or
such Lender's independent auditors, accountants, attorneys and other
professional advisors; (7) to any prospective Participant or Assignee under any
Assignment and Acceptance, actual or potential, provided that such prospective
Participant or Assignee agrees to keep such information confidential to the same
extent required of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder; (8) as expressly
permitted under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding
confidentiality to which the Borrower is party or is deemed party with the Agent
or such Lender, and (9) to its Affiliates, provided that such Affiliates agree
to be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Section 6.6.

     .7  Collateral Reporting.  The Borrower shall provide the Agent with the
     ------------------------
following documents at the following times in form satisfactory to the Agent:
(a) on a monthly basis, at any time prior to the first date, if any, on which
either (i) the Loan to Availability Ratio is equal to or greater than 40% for
five (5) consecutive Business Days or (ii) Availability as of the close of
Agent's business is less than $50,000,000 (either of such dates, a "Trigger
Date"), and on a weekly basis thereafter, a schedule of the Borrower's Accounts
created since the last such schedule, which schedule shall also identify any
collections, credits and other adjustments in respect of the Borrower's Accounts
since the last such schedule, and a Borrowing Base Certificate; provided,
                                                                --------
however, that if after any Trigger Date the Loan to Availability Ratio is less
- -------
than 40% for 120 consecutive days (such 120th day, a "Shut-Off Date") then, from
and after such Shut-Off Date, the Agent and the Lenders agree that the Borrower
shall only be required to deliver each such schedule of Borrower's Accounts and
each such Borrowing Base Certificate on a monthly basis until the next Trigger
Date, if any, and on a weekly basis thereafter until the next Shut-Off Date, if
any (the parties agree that the immediately preceding proviso shall govern the
required frequency of the Borrower's delivery of schedules of Borrower's
Accounts and Borrowing Base Certificates pursuant to this Section 6.7 in respect
of each subsequent Trigger Date and Shut-Off Date occurring thereafter); (b) on
a monthly basis, (i) an aging of the

                                      -55-
<PAGE>

Borrower's Accounts, together with a reconciliation to the previous month's or
week's, as the case may be, aging of the Borrower's Accounts and to the
Borrower's general ledger; (ii) an aging of the Borrower's accounts payable; and
(iii) Inventory reports by category, with additional detail showing additions to
and deletions from the Inventory; (c) upon request, copies of invoices in
connection with the Accounts, customer statements, credit memos, remittance
advices and reports, deposit slips, shipping and delivery documents in
connection with the Borrower's Accounts and for Inventory and Equipment acquired
by the Borrower, purchase orders and invoices; (d) upon request, a statement of
the balance of each of the Intercompany Accounts; (e) such other reports as to
the Collateral as the Agent shall reasonably request from time to time; and (f)
with the delivery of each of the foregoing, a certificate of the Borrower
executed by an officer thereof certifying as to the accuracy and completeness of
the foregoing. If any of the Borrower's records or reports of the Collateral are
prepared by an accounting service or other agent, the Borrower hereby authorizes
such service or agent to deliver such records, reports, and related documents to
the Agent, for distribution to the Lenders.

     .8  Accounts. (a) The Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Agent
     ------------
and the Lenders, with respect to the Borrower's Accounts, that: (i) each
existing Account represents, and each future Account will represent, a bona fide
                                                                       ---- ----
sale or lease and delivery of goods by the Borrower, or rendition of services by
the Borrower, in the ordinary course of the Borrower's business; (ii) each
existing Account is, and each future Account will be, for a liquidated amount
payable by the Account Debtor thereon on the terms set forth in the invoice
therefor or in the schedule thereof delivered to the Agent, without any offset,
deduction, defense, or counterclaim except those known to the Borrower and
disclosed to the Agent and the Lenders pursuant to this Agreement; (iii) no
payment will be received with respect to any Account, and no credit, discount,
or extension, or agreement therefor will be granted on any Account, except as
reported to the Agent and the Lenders in accordance with this Agreement; (iv)
each copy of an invoice delivered to the Agent by the Borrower will be a genuine
copy of the original invoice sent to the Account Debtor named therein; and (v)
all goods described in any invoice representing a sale of goods will have been
delivered to the Account Debtor and all services of the Borrower described in
each invoice will have been performed.

          (b)  The Borrower shall not re-date any invoice or sale or make sales
on extended dating beyond that customary in the Borrower's business or extend or
modify any Account. If the Borrower becomes aware of any matter adversely
affecting the collectability of any Account or Account Debtor involving an
amount greater than $200,000, including information regarding the Account
Debtor's creditworthiness, the Borrower will promptly so advise the Agent.

          (c)  The Borrower shall not accept any note or other instrument
(except a check or other instrument for the immediate payment of money) with
respect to any Account without the Agent's written consent. If the Agent
consents to the acceptance of any such instrument, it shall be considered as
evidence of the Account and not payment thereof and the Borrower will promptly
deliver such instrument to the Agent, endorsed by the Borrower to the Agent in a
manner satisfactory in form and substance to the Agent. Regardless of the form
of presentment, demand, notice of protest with respect thereto, the Borrower
shall remain liable thereon until such instrument is paid in full.

                                      -56-
<PAGE>

          (d)  The Borrower shall notify the Agent promptly of all disputes and
claims in excess of $1,000,000 with any Account Debtor, and agrees to settle,
contest, or adjust such dispute or claim at no expense to the Agent or any
Lender. No discount, credit or allowance shall be granted to any such Account
Debtor without the Agent's prior written consent, except for discounts, credits
and allowances made or given in the ordinary course of the Borrower's business
when no Event of Default exists hereunder. The Borrower shall send the Agent a
copy of each credit memorandum in excess of $1,000,000 as soon as issued. The
Agent may, and at the direction of the Majority Lenders shall, at all times when
an Event of Default exists hereunder, settle or adjust disputes and claims
directly with Account Debtors for amounts and upon terms which the Agent or the
Majority Lenders, as applicable, shall consider advisable and, in all cases, the
Agent will credit the Borrower's Loan Account with only the net amounts received
by the Agent in payment of any Accounts.

          (e)  If an Account Debtor returns any Inventory to the Borrower when
no Event of Default exists, then the Borrower shall promptly determine the
reason for such return and shall issue a credit memorandum to the Account Debtor
in the appropriate amount. The Borrower shall immediately report to the Agent
any return involving an amount in excess of $1,000,000. Each such report shall
indicate the reasons for the returns and the locations and condition of the
returned Inventory. In the event any Account Debtor returns Inventory to the
Borrower when an Event of Default exists, the Borrower, upon request of the
Agent, shall: (i) hold the returned Inventory in trust for the Agent; (ii)
segregate all returned Inventory from all of its other property; (iii) dispose
of the returned Inventory solely according to the Agent's written instructions;
and (iv) not issue any credits or allowances with respect thereto without the
Agent's prior written consent. All returned Inventory shall be subject to the
Agent's Liens thereon. Whenever any Inventory is returned, the related Account
shall be deemed ineligible to the extent of the amount owing by the Account
Debtor with respect to such returned Inventory

     .9  Collection of Accounts; Payments. (a) The Borrower shall establish a
     ------------------------------------
service for collections of Accounts at a Clearing Bank acceptable to the Agent
and subject to a Blocked Account Agreement. The Borrower shall instruct all
Account Debtors to make all payments directly to the address established for
such service. If, notwithstanding such instructions, the Borrower receives any
proceeds of Accounts, it shall receive such payments as the Agent's trustee, and
shall immediately deliver such payments to the Agent in their original form duly
endorsed in blank or deposit them into a Payment Account, as the Agent may
direct. All collections received in any such Payment Account or directly by the
Borrower or the Agent, and all funds in any Payment Account or other account to
which such collections are deposited shall be subject to the Borrower's control
at any time prior to the first date, if any, on which the Loan to Availability
Ratio exceeds 50% and to the Agent's sole control thereafter. The Agent or the
Agent's designee may, at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default,
notify Account Debtors that the Accounts have been assigned to the Agent and of
the Agent's security interest therein, and may collect them directly and charge
the collection costs and expenses to the Loan Account as a Revolving Loan. So
long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower, at the
Agent's request, shall execute and deliver to the Agent such documents as the
Agent shall require to grant the Agent access to any post office box in which
collections of Accounts are received.

                                      -57-
<PAGE>

          (b)  If sales of Inventory are made or services are rendered for cash,
the Borrower shall immediately deliver to the Agent or deposit into a Payment
Account the cash which the Borrower receives.

          (c)  All payments, including immediately available funds received by
the Agent at a bank designated by it, received by the Agent, whether or not on
account of Accounts or as proceeds of other Collateral, will be credited to the
Loan Account (conditional upon final collection) after allowing one (1) Business
Day for collection; provided, however, that such payments shall be deemed to be
                    --------  -------
credited to the Loan Account immediately upon receipt for purposes of (i)
determining Availability, (ii) calculating the Unused Line Fee pursuant to
Section 3.5, and (iii) calculating the amount of interest accrued thereon solely
- -----------
for purposes of determining the amount of interest to be distributed by the
Agent to the Lenders (but not the amount of interest payable by the Borrower).

          (d)  In the event the Borrower repays all of the Obligations upon the
termination of this Agreement or upon acceleration of the Obligations, other
than through the Agent's receipt of payments on account of the Accounts or
proceeds of the other Collateral, such payment will be credited (conditional
upon final collection) to the Loan Account one (1) Business Day after the
Agent's receipt of such funds.

     .10  Inventory; Perpetual Inventory.  The Borrower represents and warrants
     -----------------------------------
to the Agent and the Lenders and agrees with the Agent and the Lenders that all
of the Inventory owned by the Borrower is and will be held for sale or lease
(including sales for scrap of excess or no-movement Inventory), or to be
furnished in connection with the rendition of services, in the ordinary course
of the Borrower's business, and is and will be fit for such purposes. The
Borrower will keep its Inventory in good and marketable condition, at its own
expense. Borrower will not, without the prior written consent of the Agent,
acquire or accept any Inventory on consignment or approval. The Borrower agrees
that all Inventory produced in the United States will be produced in accordance
with the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and all rules,
regulations, and orders thereunder. The Borrower will conduct a physical count
of the Inventory at least once per Fiscal Year, and after and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, at such other times as the Agent requests,
but not to exceed four times in any Fiscal Year. The Borrower will maintain a
perpetual inventory reporting system at all times. The Borrower will not,
without the Agent's written consent, sell any Inventory on a bill-and-hold,
guaranteed sale, sale and return, sale on approval, consignment, or other
repurchase or return basis.

     .11  Documents, Instruments, and Chattel Paper. The Borrower represents and
     ----------------------------------------------
warrants to the Agent and the Lenders that (a) all documents, instruments, and
chattel paper describing, evidencing, or constituting Collateral, and all
signatures and endorsements thereon, are and will be complete, valid, and
genuine, and (b) all goods evidenced by such documents, instruments, and chattel

the foregoing, without discharging or otherwise affecting the liability of the
Borrower for the Obligations or under this Agreement or any other agreement now
or hereafter existing between the Agent and/or any Lender and the Borrower.

      .2  Remedies. (a) If an Event of Default exists, the Agent may, in its

discretion, and shall, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, do one or more
of the following at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or
demand on the Borrower: (i) reduce the Maximum Revolver Amount, or the advance
rates against Eligible Accounts used in computing the Borrowing Base, or reduce
one or more of the other elements used in computing the Borrowing Base; and (ii)
restrict the amount of or refuse to make Revolving Loans; and (iii) restrict or
refuse to provide the Letters of Credit or Credit Support. If an Event of
Default exists, the Agent shall, at the direction of the Majority Lenders, do
one or more of the following, in addition to the actions described in the
preceding sentence, at any time or times and in any order, without notice to or
demand on the Borrower: (A) terminate the Commitments and this Agreement; (B)
declare any or all Obligations to be immediately due and payable; provided,
                                                                  --------
however, that upon the occurrence of any Event of Default described in
- -------
Sections 11.1(e), 11.2(f), 11.1(g), or 11.1(h), the Commitments shall
- -------------------------  -------     -------
automatically and immediately expire and all Obligations shall automatically
become immediately due and payable without notice or demand of any kind; and (C)
pursue its other rights and remedies under the Loan Documents and applicable
law.

          (b) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: (i) the
Agent shall have for the benefit of the Lenders, in addition to all other rights
of the Agent and the Lenders, the rights and remedies of a secured party under
the UCC; (ii) the Agent may, at any time, take possession of the Collateral and
keep it on the Borrower's premises, at no cost to the Agent or any Lender, or
remove any part of it to such other place or places as the Agent may desire, or
the Borrower shall, upon the Agent's demand, at the Borrower's cost, assemble
the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at a place reasonably
convenient to the Agent; and (iii) the Agent may sell and deliver any Collateral
at public or private sales, for cash, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices
and upon such terms as the Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion, and
may, if the Agent deems it reasonable, postpone or adjourn any sale of the
Collateral by an announcement at the time and place of sale or of such postponed
or adjourned sale without giving a new notice of sale. Without in any way
requiring notice to be given in the following manner, the Borrower agrees that
any notice by the Agent of sale, disposition or other intended action hereunder
or in connection herewith, whether required by the UCC or otherwise, shall
constitute reasonable notice to the Borrower if such notice is mailed by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or is
delivered personally against receipt, at least five (5) Business Days prior to
such action to the Borrower's address specified in or pursuant to Section 15.8.
                                                                  ------------
If any Collateral is sold on terms other than payment in full at the time of
sale, no credit shall be given against the Obligations until the Agent or the
Lenders receive payment, and if the buyer defaults in payment, the Agent may
resell the Collateral without further notice to the Borrower. In the event the
Agent seeks to take possession of all or any portion of the Collateral by
judicial process, the Borrower irrevocably waives: (A) the posting of any bond,
surety or security with respect thereto which might otherwise be required; (B)
any demand for possession prior to the commencement of any suit or action to
recover the Collateral; and (C) any requirement that the Agent retain possession
and not dispose of any Collateral until after trial or final judgment. The
Borrower agrees that the Agent has no obligation to preserve rights to the

                                      -85-
<PAGE>

Collateral or marshal any Collateral for the benefit of any Person. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law and by any applicable contract
governing the usage thereof, the Agent is hereby granted a license or other
right to use, without charge, the Borrower's labels, patents, copyrights, name,
trade secrets, trade names, trademarks (subject to the Borrower's right to
police the proper usage of trademarks and the maintenance of product quality
associated therewith), and advertising matter, or any similar property, in
completing production of any Collateral that is work-in-process, advertising or
selling any Collateral, and the Borrower's rights under all licenses and all
franchise agreements shall inure to the Agent's benefit for such purpose. The
proceeds of sale shall be applied first to all expenses of sale, including
attorneys' fees, and then to the Obligations. The Agent will return any excess
to the Borrower and the Borrower shall remain liable for any deficiency.

        (c) If an Event of Default occurs, the Borrower hereby waives all rights
to notice and hearing prior to the exercise by the Agent of the Agent's rights
to repossess the Collateral without judicial process or to reply, attach or levy
upon the Collateral without notice or hearing.

party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations, including, but not
limited to, the obligation to participate in Letters of Credit and Credit

Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto).

assigning Lender thereunder and the Assignee thereunder confirm to and agree

appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such Assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (v) such Assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with such powers,
including the discretionary rights and incidental power, as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and (vi) such Assignee agrees that it will perform in
accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms of this
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

under the Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be
amended to the extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition
of the Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising
therefrom. The Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such
Commitments of the assigning Lender pro tanto.

any consent or waiver with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and all amounts payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined
as if such Lender had not sold such participation; except that, if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared
or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent

interest were owing directly to it as a Lender under this Agreement.

misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any
recital, statement, representation or warranty made by the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower, or any officer thereof, contained in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, or in any certificate, report,
statement or other document referred to or provided for in, or received by the
Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
the validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for any failure of the Borrower or any
other party to any Loan Document to perform its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall be under any obligation to any Lender
to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the
agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or to inspect the properties, books or records of the Borrower or any
of the Borrower's Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

     .4  Reliance by Agent. (a) The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall
     ---------------------
be fully protected in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, facsimile, telex or telephone message,
statement or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and
correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons,
and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The
Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such
advice or concurrence of the Majority Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it
so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders
against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority
Lenders (or all Lenders if so required by Section 13.2) and such request and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all of the
Lenders.

          (b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 10.1, each Lender that has executed this Agreement shall
             ------------
be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with,
each document or other matter either sent by the Agent to such Lender for
consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Lender.

     .5  Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
     ---------------------
notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, unless the Agent
shall have received written notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to
this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default." The Agent will notify the Lenders of its
receipt of any such notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as may be requested by the Majority Lenders in
accordance with Section 11; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent
                ----------  --------  -------
has received any such request, the

                                      -91-
<PAGE>

Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of Default as it shall
deem advisable.

      .6  Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that none of the Agent-
      -------------------
Related Persons has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act
by the Agent hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Borrower and its Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by any Agent-Related Person to any Lender. Each Lender represents to
the Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related
Person and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, prospects,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Borrower and its Affiliates, and all applicable bank regulatory laws relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into
this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower. Each Lender also represents
that it will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and to make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly herein required to be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent,
the Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with
any credit or other information concerning the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower
which may come into the possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

     .7  Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
     -------------------
are consummated, the Lenders shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related
Persons (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and
without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), pro rata, from and
against any and all Indemnified Liabilities as such term is defined in Section
15.11; provided, however, that no Lender shall be liable for the payment to
       --------  -------
the Agent-Related Persons of any portion of such Indemnified Liabilities
resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender shall reimburse the Agent upon
demand for its ratable share of any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including
Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement
(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal
advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other
Loan Document, or any document contemplated by or referred to herein, to the
extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the
Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Agent.

     .8  Agent in Individual Capacity. The Bank and its Affiliates may make
     --------------------------------
loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates as though the Bank were not the Agent hereunder and
without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lenders acknowledge that,
pursuant to such

                                      -92-
<PAGE>

activities, the Bank or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the
Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such Subsidiary) and
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to its Loans, the Bank shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender and may exercise the
same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" and "Lenders"
include the Bank in its individual capacity.

      .9  Successor Agent. The Agent may resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice
      -------------------
to the Lenders and the Borrower, such resignation to be effective upon the
acceptance of a successor agent to its appointment as Agent. In the event the
Bank sells all of its Commitment and Revolving Loans as part of a sale, transfer
or other disposition by the Bank of substantially all of its loan portfolio, the
Bank shall resign as Agent and such purchaser or transferee shall become the
successor Agent hereunder. If the Agent resigns under this Agreement, subject to
the proviso in the preceding sentence, the Majority Lenders shall appoint from
among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. If no successor agent is appointed
prior to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may
appoint, after consulting with the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent
from among the Lenders, which successor agent shall be reasonably satisfactory
to the Borrower. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent
hereunder, such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and
duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be
terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the
provisions of this Section 14 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
                   ----------
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement.

     .10  Withholding Tax. (a) If any Lender is a "foreign corporation,
     --------------------
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Lender claims
exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or
1442 of the Code, such Lender agrees with and in favor of the Agent, to deliver
to the Agent:

          (i)  if such Lender claims an exemption from, or a reduction
     of, withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly
     completed IRS Forms 1001 and W-8 before the payment of any
     interest in the first calendar year and before the payment of any
     interest in each third succeeding calendar year during which
     interest may be paid under this Agreement;

          (ii) if such Lender claims that interest paid under this
     Agreement is exempt from United States withholding tax because it
     is effectively connected with a United States trade or business
     of such Lender, two properly completed and executed copies of IRS
     Form 4224 before the payment of any interest is due in the first
     taxable year of

                                      -93-
<PAGE>

     such Lender and in each succeeding taxable year of such Lender
     during which interest may be paid under this Agreement, and IRS
     Form W-9; and

          (iii) such other form or forms as may be required under the
     Code or other laws of the United States as a condition to
     exemption from, or reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Lender agrees to promptly notify the Agent of any change in
circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction.

          (b) If any Lender claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1001 and such Lender
sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of
the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lender, such Lender agrees to notify the
Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of
Obligations of the Borrower to such Lender. To the extent of such percentage
amount, the Agent will treat such Lender's IRS Form 1001 as no longer valid.

          (c) If any Lender claiming exemption from United States withholding
tax by filing IRS Form 4224 with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a
participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of the
Borrower to such Lender, such Lender agrees to undertake sole responsibility for
complying with the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and
1442 of the Code.

          (d) If any Lender is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account
such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required by subsection (a)
of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold from
any interest payment to such Lender not providing such forms or other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

          (e) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered
the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any
other reason) such Lender shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties
and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts
payable to the Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Lenders under this subsection
shall survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement
of the Agent.

     .11  Collateral Matters.
     -----------------------

          (a) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent, at its option
and in its sole discretion, to release any Agent's Lien upon any Collateral (i)
upon the termination of the

                                      -94-
<PAGE>

Commitments and payment and satisfaction in full by Borrower of all Loans and
reimbursement obligations in respect of Letters of Credit and Credit Support,
and the termination of all outstanding Letters of Credit (whether or not any of
such obligations are due) and all other Obligations; (ii) constituting property
being sold or disposed of if the Borrower certifies to the Agent that the sale
or disposition is made in compliance with Section 9.9 (and the Agent may rely
                                          -----------
conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry); (iii)
constituting property in which the Borrower owned no interest at the time the
Lien was granted or at any time thereafter; or (iv) constituting property leased
to the Borrower under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a
transaction permitted under this Agreement. Except as provided above, the Agent
will not release any of the Agent's Liens without the prior written
authorization of the Lenders; provided that the Agent may, in its discretion,
                              --------
release the Agent's Liens on Collateral valued in the aggregate not in excess of
$10,000,000 during any one year period without the prior written authorization
of the Lenders. Upon request by the Agent or the Borrower at any time, the
Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent's authority to release any Agent's
Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral pursuant to this Section
                                                                    -------
14.11.
- -----

          (b) Upon receipt by the Agent of any authorization required pursuant
to Section 14.11(a) from the Lenders of the Agent's authority to release any
   ----------------
Agent's Liens upon particular types or items of Collateral, and upon at least
five (5) Business Days' prior written request by the Borrower, the Agent shall
(and is hereby irrevocably authorized by the Lenders to) execute such documents
as may be necessary to evidence the release of the Agent's Liens upon such
Collateral; provided, however, that (i) the Agent shall not be required to
            --------  -------
execute any such document on terms which, in the Agent's opinion, would expose
the Agent to liability or create any obligation or entail any consequence other
than the release of such Liens without recourse or warranty, and (ii) such
release shall not in any manner discharge, affect or impair the Obligations or
any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of
the Borrower in respect of) all interests retained by the Borrower, including
the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the
Collateral.

          (c) The Agent shall have no obligation whatsoever to any of the
Lenders to assure that the Collateral exists or is owned by the Borrower or is
cared for, protected or insured or has been encumbered, or that the Agent's
Liens have been properly or sufficiently or lawfully created, perfected,
protected or enforced or are entitled to any particular priority, or to exercise
at all or in any particular manner or under any duty of care, disclosure or
fidelity, or to continue exercising, any of the rights, authorities and powers
granted or available to the Agent pursuant to any of the Loan Documents, it
being understood and agreed that in respect of the Collateral, or any act,
omission or event related thereto, the Agent may act in any manner it may deem
appropriate, in its sole discretion given the Agent's own interest in the
Collateral in its capacity as one of the Lenders and that the Agent shall have
no other duty or liability whatsoever to any Lender as to any of the foregoing.

     .12  Restrictions on Actions by Lenders; Sharing of Payments. (a)  Each of
     ------------------------------------------------------------
the Lenders agrees that it shall not, without the express consent of all
Lenders, and that it shall, to the extent it is lawfully entitled to do so, upon
the request of all Lenders, set off against the Obligations, any amounts owing
by such Lender to the Borrower or any accounts of the Borrower now or

                                      -95-
<PAGE>

hereafter maintained with such Lender. Each of the Lenders further agrees
that it shall not, unless specifically requested to do so by the Agent, take or
cause to be taken any action to enforce its rights under this Agreement or
against the Borrower, including the commencement of any legal or equitable
proceedings, to foreclose any Lien on, or otherwise enforce any security
interest in, any of the Collateral.

          (b) If at any time or times any Lender shall receive (i) by payment,
foreclosure, setoff or otherwise, any proceeds of Collateral or any payments
with respect to the Obligations of the Borrower to such Lender arising under, or
relating to, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, except for any such
proceeds or payments received by such Lender from the Agent pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, or (ii) payments from the Agent in excess of such
Lender's ratable portion of all such distributions by the Agent, such Lender
shall promptly (1) turn the same over to the Agent, in kind, and with such
endorsements as may be required to negotiate the same to the Agent, or in same
day funds, as applicable, for the account of all of the Lenders and for
application to the Obligations in accordance with the applicable provisions of
this Agreement, or (2) purchase, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
interest and participation in the Obligations owed to the other Lenders so that
such excess payment received shall be applied ratably as among the Lenders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares; provided, however, that if all or part of
                                       --------  -------
such excess payment received by the purchasing party is thereafter recovered
from it, those purchases of participations shall be rescinded in whole or in
part, as applicable, and the applicable portion of the purchase price paid
therefor shall be returned to such purchasing party, but without interest except
to the extent that such purchasing party is required to pay interest in
connection with the recovery of the excess payment.

     .13  Agency for Perfection. Each Lender hereby appoints each other Lender
     --------------------------
as agent for the purpose of perfecting the Lenders' security interest in assets
which, in accordance with Article 9 of the UCC can be perfected only by
possession. Should any Lender (other than the Agent) obtain possession of any
such Collateral, such Lender shall notify the Agent thereof, and, promptly upon
the Agent's request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to the Agent or in
accordance with the Agent's instructions.

     .14  Payments by Agent to Lenders. All payments to be made by the Agent
     ---------------------------------
to the Lenders shall be made by bank wire transfer or internal transfer of
immediately available funds to each Lender pursuant to wire transfer
instructions delivered in writing to the Agent on or prior to the Closing Date
(or if such Lender is an Assignee, on the applicable Assignment and Acceptance),
or pursuant to such other wire transfer instructions as each party may designate
for itself by written notice to the Agent. Concurrently with each such payment,
the Agent shall identify whether such payment (or any portion thereof)
represents principal, premium or interest on the Revolving Loans or otherwise.

     .15  Concerning the Collateral and the Related Loan Documents. Each Lender
     -------------------------------------------------------------
authorizes and directs the Agent to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents relating to the Collateral, for the ratable benefit of the Agent and
the Lenders. Each Lender agrees that any action taken by the Agent, Majority
Lenders or Required Lenders, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents relating to the Collateral, and the

                                      -96-
<PAGE>

exercise by the Agent, the Majority Lenders, or the Required Lenders, as
applicable, of their respective powers set forth therein or herein, together
with such other powers that are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be binding
upon all of the Lenders.

     ---------------------------------------------------------------
this Agreement, each Lender:

          (b) expressly agrees and acknowledges that neither the Bank nor the
Agent (i) makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any Report,
or (ii) shall be liable for any information contained in any Report;

          (c) expressly agrees and acknowledges that the Reports are not

provision contained in this Agreement, agrees: (i) to hold the Agent and any
such other Lender preparing a Report harmless from any action the indemnifying
Lender may take or conclusion the indemnifying Lender may reach or draw from any
Report in connection with any loans or other credit accommodations that the
indemnifying Lender has made or may make to the Borrower, or the indemnifying
Lender's participation in, or the indemnifying Lender's purchase of, a loan or
loans of the Borrower; and (ii) to pay and protect, and indemnify, defend and
hold the Agent and any such other Lender preparing a Report harmless from and
against, the claims, actions, proceedings, damages, costs, expenses and other
amounts (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agent and any such other
Lender preparing a Report as the direct or indirect result of any third parties
who might obtain all or part of any Report through the indemnifying Lender.

     ---------------------------
and no Lender shall be liable for the acts or omissions of, or (except as
otherwise set forth herein in case of the Agent) authorized to act for, any
other Lender.

any part of the Obligations.

Borrower waives presentment, protest and notice of demand or dishonor and
protest as to any instrument, notice of intent to accelerate the Obligations and
notice of acceleration of the Obligations, as well as any and all other notices
to which it might otherwise be entitled. No notice to or demand on the Borrower
which the Agent or any Lender may elect to give shall entitle the Borrower to
any or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.

     .10  Binding Effect. The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon
     -------------------
and inure to the benefit of the respective representatives, successors, and

                               --------  -------
assigned by the Borrower without prior written consent of the Agent and each
Lender. The rights and benefits of the Agent and the Lenders

                                     -101-
<PAGE>

hereunder shall, if such Persons so agree, inure to any party acquiring any
interest in the Obligations or any part thereof.

     .11  Indemnity of the Agent and the Lenders by the Borrower. The Borrower
     ------------------------------------------------------------
agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Agent-Related Persons, and each Lender
and each of its respective officers, directors, employees, counsel, agents and
attorneys-in-fact (each, an "Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any
and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including
reasonable Attorney Costs of counsel mutually acceptable to the Borrower and the
applicable Indemnified Person) of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any
time (including at any time following repayment of the Loans and the
termination, resignation or replacement of the Agent or replacement of any
Lender) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person in any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by
or referred to herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any action
taken or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of the
foregoing, including with respect to any investigation, litigation or proceeding
(including any Insolvency Proceeding or appellate proceeding) related to or
arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or the Loans or the use
of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified Person is a party
thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities");
provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from
the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified
Person. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all other
Obligations.

     .12  Limitation of Liability. No claim may be made by the Borrower, any
     ----------------------------
Lender or other Person against the Agent, any Lender, or the affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, or agents of any of them for any
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages in respect of any claim for
breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or related to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or
any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and the Borrower
and each Lender hereby waive, release and agree not to sue upon any claim for
such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to
exist in its favor.

     .13  Final Agreement. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are
     --------------------
intended by the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders to be the final, complete,
and exclusive expression of the agreement between them. This Agreement
supersedes any and all prior oral or written agreements relating to the subject
matter hereof. No modification, rescission, waiver, release, or amendment of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall be made, except by
a written agreement signed by the Borrower and a duly authorized officer of each
of the Agent and the requisite Lenders.

     .14  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
     -----------------
counterparts, and by the Agent, each Lender and the Borrower in separate
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which shall
together constitute one and the same agreement; signature pages

                                     -102-
<PAGE>

may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a single
counterpart so that all signature pages are physically attached to the same
document.

     .15  Captions. The captions contained in this Agreement are for convenience
     -------------
of reference only, are without substantive meaning and should not be construed
to modify, enlarge, or restrict any provision.

     .16  Right of Setoff. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders
     --------------------
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time,
without prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the
Borrower to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any
time held by, and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Lender to or for
the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all Obligations owing
to such Lender, now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the
Agent or such Lender shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan
Document and although such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each
Lender agrees promptly to notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such set-
off and application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to
                                         --------  -------
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO LENDER SHALL EXERCISE ANY RIGHT OF SET-OFF,
BANKER'S LIEN, OR THE LIKE AGAINST ANY DEPOSIT ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY OF THE
BORROWER HELD OR MAINTAINED BY SUCH LENDER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN UNANIMOUS
CONSENT OF THE LENDERS.

     .17  Joint and Several Liability.
     --------------------------------
          (a) The Borrower shall be liable for all amounts due to the Agent
and/or any Lender under this Agreement, regardless of which Borrower actually
receives Loans or other extensions of credit hereunder or the amount of such
Loans received or the manner in which the Agent and/or such Lender accounts for
such Loans or other extensions of credit on its books and records.  The
Borrower's Obligations with respect to Loans made to it, and the Borrower's
Obligations arising as a result of the joint and several liability of the
Borrower hereunder, with respect to Loans made to the other Borrower hereunder,
shall be separate and distinct obligations, but all such Obligations shall be
primary obligations of the Borrower.

          (b) The Borrower's Obligations arising as a result of the joint and
several liability of the Borrower hereunder with respect to Loans or other
extensions of credit made to the other Borrower hereunder shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be unconditional irrespective of (i) the validity or
enforceability, avoidance or subordination of the Obligations of the other
Borrower or of any promissory note or other document evidencing all or any part
of the Obligations of the other Borrower, (ii) the absence of any attempt to
collect the Obligations from the other Borrower, any other guarantor, or any
other security therefor, or the absence of any other action to enforce the same,
(iii) the waiver, consent, extension, forbearance or granting of any indulgence
by the Agent and/or any Lender with respect to any provision of any instrument
evidencing the Obligations of the other Borrower, or any part thereof, or any
other agreement

                                     -103-
<PAGE>

now or hereafter executed by the other Borrower and delivered to the Agent
and/or any Lender, (iv) the failure by the Agent and/or any Lender to take any
steps to perfect and maintain its security interest in, or to preserve its
rights to, any security or collateral for the Obligations of the other Borrower,
(v) the Agent's and/or any Lender's election, in any proceeding instituted under
the Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy
Code, (vi) any borrowing or grant of a security interest by the other Borrower,
as debtor-in-possession under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code, (vii) the
disallowance of all or any portion of the Agent's and/or any Lender's claim(s)
for the repayment of the Obligations of the other Borrower under Section 502 of
the Bankruptcy Code, or (viii) any other circumstances which might constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor or of the other Borrower.
With respect to the Borrower's Obligations arising as a result of the joint and
several liability of the Borrower hereunder with respect to Loans or other
extensions of credit made to either of the other Borrower hereunder, the
Borrower waives, until the Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Loan
Agreement shall have been terminated, any right to enforce any right of
subrogation or any remedy which the Agent and/or any Lender now has or may
hereafter have against the Borrower, any endorser or any guarantor of all or any
part of the Obligations, and any benefit of, and any right to participate in,
any security or collateral given to the Agent and/or any Lender to secure
payment of the Obligations or any other liability of the Borrower to the Agent
and/or any Lender.

          Upon any Event of Default, the Agent may proceed directly and at once,
without notice, against the Borrower to collect and recover the full amount, or
any portion of the Obligations, without first proceeding against the other
Borrower or any other Person, or against any security or collateral for the
Obligations.  The Borrower consents and agrees that the Agent shall be under no
obligation to marshal any assets in favor of the Borrower or against or in
payment of any or all of the Obligations.

     .18  Contribution and Indemnification among the Borrowers. Each Borrower is
     ---------------------------------------------------------
obligated to repay the Obligations as joint and several obligors under this
Agreement. To the extent that any Borrower shall, under this Agreement as a
joint and several obligor, repay any of the Obligations constituting Loans made
to another Borrower hereunder or other Obligations incurred directly and
primarily by any other Borrower (an "Accommodation Payment"), then the Borrower
making such Accommodation Payment shall be entitled to contribution and
indemnification from, and be reimbursed by, each of the other Borrowers in an
amount, for each of such other Borrowers, equal to a fraction of such
Accommodation Payment, the numerator of which fraction is such other Borrower's
"Allocable Amount" (as defined below) and the denominator of which is the sum of
the Allocable Amounts of all of the Borrowers. As of any date of determination,
the "Allocable Amount" of each Borrower shall be equal to the maximum amount of
liability for Accommodation Payments which could be asserted against such
Borrower hereunder without (a) rendering such Borrower "insolvent" within the
meaning of Section 101 (31) of the Bankruptcy Code, Section 2 of the Uniform
Fraudulent Transfer Act ("UFTA") or Section 2 of the Uniform Fraudulent
Conveyance Act ("UFCA"), (ii) leaving such Borrower with unreasonably small
capital or assets, within the meaning of Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code,
Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA, or (iii) leaving such Borrower
unable to pay its debts as they become due within the meaning of Section 548 of
the Bankruptcy Code or

                                     -104-
<PAGE>

Section 4 of the UFTA, or Section 5 of the UFCA. All rights and claims of
contribution, indemnification and reimbursement under this section shall be
subordinate in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the Obligations.
The provisions of this section shall, to the extent expressly inconsistent with
any provision in any Loan Document, supersede such inconsistent provision.

     .19  Agency of the Parent for each other Borrower. AMDISS hereby
     -------------------------------------------------
irrevocably appoints the Parent as its agent for all purposes relevant to this
Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents, including the giving and receipt
of notices and execution and delivery of all documents, instruments and
certificates contemplated herein and all modifications hereto. Any
acknowledgement, consent, direction, certification or other action which might
otherwise be valid or effective only if given or taken by both of the Borrowers
or each acting singly, shall be valid and effective if given or taken only by
the Parent, whether or not AMDISS joins therein.

     .20  Priority of Obligations. The parties acknowledge that the Obligations
     ----------------------------
under this Agreement (a) shall be pari passu in right of payment with the senior
notes issued under the Indenture, and (b) shall be senior to the Convertible
Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to an Indenture dated May 8, 1998 between the
Parent and The Bank of New York, as trustee.

                           [Signature pages follow.]

Mr. Richard Previte
President & Chief Operating Officer
Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Dear Rich:

I am pleased to confirm your participation in a special bonus program to reflect
your contributions as President & Chief Operating Officer of Advanced Micro
Devices, Inc. (the "Company"), effective March 11, 1997. The substantive terms
of your bonus are described below. If you agree to the terms outlined in this
letter, please countersign the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to the
Corporate Secretary.


1. The amount of your bonus under the Company's 1996 Executive Incentive Plan
will be equal to three-tenths of one percent (.3%) of "Adjusted Operating
Profits" of the Company for each respective fiscal year of the Company in excess
of twenty percent (20%) of the Adjusted Operating Profits for the Company's
immediately preceding fiscal year. "Adjusted Operating Profits" of the Company
are defined as operating income, as reported on the Company's financial
statements, increased for any pre-tax operating income and decreased for any
pre-tax operating loss from the Fujitsu Joint Venture (and by subsequent joint
ventures approved by the Board of Directors of the Company for these purposes)
and increased by any expenses accrued for profit sharing plan contributions and
bonuses under the Company's Executive Bonus Plan, including the bonus calculated
hereunder.

2. You will earn a bonus for 1997 and future years, so long as you remain
President & Chief Operating Officer, except as otherwise set forth in this
letter. The provisions of this letter supersede any other bonus arrangements
that may be applicable to you.

3. The maximum amount payable with respect to any one fiscal year shall be
limited to 300% of your base salary payable during that year. Any amount earned
in excess of the maximum amount shall be carried over for up to three years.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the total amount payable with respect to each
such fiscal year may not exceed the maximum amount payable pursuant to the
Company's 1996 Executive Incentive Plan for any fiscal year.

4. In case of retirement, death or disability, or a change in title or current
responsibilities, your bonus will be prorated for the fiscal year only if you
served as President & Chief Operating Officer for less than six months, if you
served as President & Chief Operating Officer for six months or more, you will
earn an amount based on operating results for the full fiscal year. For these
purposes, "disability" has

the same meaning as under the Executive Disability Plan at the time your
disability commences.


5. The bonus will be paid following release of the Company's financial results
for the last quarter of each fiscal year referred to above. You must be employed
on the distribution date in order to receive your bonus or any carryover amount
then payable. The bonus will be paid provided you are still an employee on the
distribution date, even if you are no longer President & Chief Operating
Officer.

6. The Company reserves the right to modify or terminate this arrangement at its
sole discretion with respect to future services.

I look forward to continuing to work closely with you as we achieve our shared
vision of an AMD that is truly world class in every respect.

Sincerely,

                                 June 23, 1999


Mr. Gene Conner
[Home address]

Dear Gene:

     As you must know, it is with regret over your decision, combined with
gratitude for your years of contribution that AMD has accepted your resignation
as an executive officer of AMD. This letter will formalize the terms of your
separation from the company.

     l)   You will remain an active employee through October 21, 1999.

     2)   Between July 12 and September 7, 1999, you will be on sabbatical.

     3)   Between September 8, 1999 and October 21, 1999 you will be on
          vacation.

     4)   Beginning October 22, 1999 and continuing through October 21, 2000,
          you will be on paid leave of absence status. During your leave of
          absence you will continue to receive your current salary, plus any
          applicable increase (further discussed in paragraph 7, below). Subject
          to paragraph 5, below, you also will remain enrolled in your current
          health and dental plans, and the AMD Profit Sharing Plans. You will
          not remain enrolled in the executive life insurance plan, but you may
          participate in the employee life insurance plan. You also may continue
          to participate in AMD's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the 401k Plan,
          the Dependent Care and Health Care Reimbursement Plans (through June
          30, 2000), and the Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Plan.
          You will not accrue vacation during your leave of absence.

     5)   On October 22, 2000 (or on any earlier date that you become employed
          as a regular employee for another company), your employment with AMD
          will terminate. At that time you will be informed of the options
          available to you with respect to the payout of your various retirement
          income sources at AMD. In the event your termination date is earlier
          than October 22, 2000 (and you are not terminated for cause), salary
          payments through October 22, 2000 will be paid in a lump sum on your
          termination date. All AMD benefits for which you are eligible during
          your leave of absence will end on your termination date.

     6)   So long as you are on sabbatical, vacation or paid leave of absence,
          your existing stock options will continue to vest pursuant to the term
          and conditions of the stock option plans and grant agreements under
          which they were granted. Following your termination, you will have one
          year from your termination date to exercise any vested but unexercised
          stock options.

     7)   In the event AMD adopts a defined benefit or other pension benefit
          plan prior to your termination, you will be entitled to participate in
          that plan, pursuant to its terms.

     8)   You will be eligible for a salary increase in 1999, subject to the
          following limitations: the amount of increase will be equal to the
          Consumer Price Index average increase for urban wage earners in San
          Francisco published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for calendar
          year 1998. You will be eligible to receive your increase when other
          executive officers receive theirs.

     9)   Should there be an Executive Bonus Plan payment for 1999, you will
          receive a special bonus of $100,000, payable at the same time that AMD
          Officers receive their bonus payments.

     10)  Pursuant to the approval which was granted at the April 29, 1999
          Annual Meeting of Shareholders, you will be granted 37,500 options,
          which are to vest on July 10, 2000. The terms of the stock option
          agreement under which those options are granted provides that once
          such options have vested, you will have one year from the date of your
          termination date to exercise those options.

     11)  You will continue to receive a vehicle expense allowance in the amount
          of $2000 per month under the terms and conditions of AMD Car Plan A
          until your termination.

     12)  All of the company's policies and programs, including policies
          concerning trading in AMD stock and the protection and ownership of
          intellectual property, will continue to apply to you, and where
          applicable will extend beyond termination of employment.

     If these terms meet with your approval, please sign and date this letter,
below and return it to me. If you have any questions, please feel free to call
me.


                                    Sincerely,
                                    /s/ Stan Winvick
