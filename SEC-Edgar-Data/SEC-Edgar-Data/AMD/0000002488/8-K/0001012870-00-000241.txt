                       AMD REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS

   --AMD earns $65 million, or $0.43 per share, on record quarterly revenue--



     SUNNYVALE, CA -- January 19, 2000 -- Led by strong seasonal consumer demand
for personal computers, AMD today reported record sales of $968,710,000 and net
income of $65,080,000 in the quarter ended December 26, 1999. Net income
amounted to $0.43 per diluted share. The company reported strong growth in the
just-completed quarter and continuing strong demand in all of its product groups
- - the Computation Products Group, the Memory Group, and the Communications
Group.

     Sales grew by 46 percent from the immediate-prior quarter, and by 23
percent from the like period of 1998. In the immediate-prior quarter, AMD
reported sales of $662,192,000 and a net loss of $105,545,000, or $0.72 per
share. In the fourth quarter of 1998, AMD reported sales $788,820,000, which
resulted in net income of $22,321,000, or $0.15 per diluted share.

                                       2

     At $2,857,604,000, AMD sales for 1999 grew by 12 percent and reached a
record high for the company. For 1999, AMD reported a net loss of $88,936,000,
or $0.60 per share. Results for 1999 include a one-time after-tax gain of
$259,236,000 from the sale of Vantis Corporation, the company's programmable
logic products subsidiary that was sold during the second quarter of 1999. Sales
for AMD continuing product groups - the Computation Products Group,
Communications Group, and Memory Group - grew by 17 percent over 1998. In 1998,
AMD reported sales of $2,542,141,000, and a net loss of $103,960,000, or $0.72
per share.

     "AMD had an outstanding quarter as all of our product groups reported
significant growth in sales from the immediate-prior quarter," said W.J. Sanders
III, chairman and chief executive officer. "Our results reflected both the
seasonal boost in already-robust semiconductor demand and the successful
achievement of our aggressive goals for the AMD Athlon(TM) processor. Sales
growth of AMD Athlon processors alone contributed more than half of our greater
than $300 million sequential sales growth. Seasonal strength in the PC market
also enabled us to grow sales sequentially from our AMD-K6(R) processor family
on near-record unit volumes. Total PC processor unit shipments grew by 35
percent to more than 6 million units, a new record. Processor sales grew by 67
percent from the immediate-prior quarter and by 1 percent over the previous
record in the comparable period of 1998.


     "AMD Athlon processor unit sales surpassed our goal of 800,000 units for
the quarter and enabled us to achieve our target of cumulative unit shipments of
one million for the year.

     "AMD continues to execute well to its processor roadmap," Sanders said. "We
accelerated our planned introduction of higher-speed AMD Athlon processors, with
750-megahertz (MHz) devices in the fourth quarter and an 800-MHz version on
January 6. Our transition to 180-nanometer (0.18-micron) technology is
progressing smoothly. Eighty percent of our wafer output for AMD Athlon
processors is currently on 180-nanometer technology, and our wafer output of AMD
Athlon processors will be 100 percent on 180-nanometer technology in February."

     The company stated that strong demand for AMD high-density, low-power Flash
memory devices, driven primarily by cellular telephone applications, resulted in
record sales of $275 million for the Memory Group. Sales increased by 33 percent
over the immediate-prior quarter's sales of $206 million, and more than doubled
from the like period of 1998 when sales were $132 million. Demand for AMD flash
memory products continues to exceed capacity.

     The Communications Group also benefited from strong demand, as it achieved
34 percent sequential sales growth over the immediate-prior quarter, and 48
percent sales growth over the like period of 1998. Communications Group sales
reached $94 million in the fourth quarter compared to $70 million in the third
quarter, and $63 million in the fourth quarter of 1998.

     In the aggregate, the book-to-bill ratio was significantly over 1:1 in the
fourth quarter.

     "Our ability to return to solid profitability on substantial growth from
all of our product groups is directly attributable to the exemplary performance
of the worldwide AMD team. Particularly noteworthy in the quarter was the
attainment of record unit market share/1/ in PC processors in the era of AMD
proprietary designs highlighted by the award-winning/2/ AMD Athlon processor,"
Sanders concluded.

Current Outlook

     The company's outlook statements are based on current expectations. The
following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ
materially.

     The company currently projects sales in the first quarter to be flat to
slightly down, reflecting an anticipated seasonal slowdown in the retail sector
of the personal computer market following an exceptionally strong fourth quarter
in the sector. The company's current overall outlook is based on the following
projections for its major product lines:

                                       4

     Based on the normal seasonal patterns of personal computer demand, the
company expects its overall PC processor unit shipments will grow substantially
from the comparable period of 1999, but will decline modestly from the record
level of the fourth quarter. Unit shipments of AMD Athlon processors are
expected to increase, resulting in a richer mix and higher blended average
selling price for PC processors. For the year, the company anticipates continued
growth in personal computer sales and in the PC processors that power them, with
the distribution of unit demand skewed to the second half of the year as usual.

     Communication Group sales are projected to grow by 50 percent compared to
the first quarter of 1999 and by a mid-single-digit percentage sequentially.
Demand remains strong.

     AMD projects that Memory Group sales will more than double compared to the
first quarter of 1999 and will grow by 10 percent sequentially. Demand is
expected to continue to exceed supply.

     With the Semiconductor Industry Association and others forecasting
worldwide industry growth in the range of 20 to 25 percent in 2000, the company
believes that it is positioned to grow faster than the industry.

1995. Forward-looking statements are generally preceded by words such as
"plans," "expects," "believes," "anticipates" or "intends." Investors are
cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this release involve risks and
uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from current

demand for AMD's products will not continue at current or greater levels; that
the company will not be able to produce the AMD Athlon(TM) processor using 0.18
micron process technology in the volume, speed mix or with the feature set
necessary to meet customer requirements and the company's goals; that Intel
Corporation pricing, marketing programs or other activities targeting the
