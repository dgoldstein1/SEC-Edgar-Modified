or the incurrence of any liability, in either case which is unreasonable in
light of the related objective, nor does it require that the obligated party act
in a manner which would otherwise be contrary to prudent business judgment in
light of the objective attempted to be achieved.  The fact that the objective is
not actually accomplished is not dispositive evidence that the obligated party
did not in fact utilize its Reasonable Efforts in attempting to accomplish the
objective.

Purchased Preferred Shares must be held indefinitely unless subsequently
registered under the Securities Act or unless an exemption from registration is

Securities Act, which, in substance, permit limited public resale of "restricted

acquisition of the Business, cause the Company to employ each CPD Employee (the
"Transferred Employees") at the same or substantially comparable total
 ---------------------
compensation (including base salary and bonus but excluding stock-based
compensation and any stay bonus or retention payments) as in effect immediately
prior to the Closing. Such Transferred Employees shall become employees of the
Company effective at 12:01 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the Closing Date,
except as set forth in Section 8.4(b) or (c) (such date of hire by the Company
referred to herein as the "Hire Date").
                          ---------

                                       28
<PAGE>

          (b)   LLC agrees to cause the Company to offer each Inactive Employee
employment under the terms applicable to Transferred Employees when the Company
is notified that such person will return to work.  If the offer is accepted,
such person shall be treated as a Transferred Employee for all purposes under
this Agreement.  Until any such employee returns to active employment with the
Company, AMD shall be responsible for such employee's salary and benefits
including, without limitation, disability benefits.

          (c)   LLC agrees to cause the Company to offer each International
Employee and Visa Employee employment under the terms applicable to Transferred
Employees as soon as practicable following the Closing Date.  If the offer is
accepted, such person shall be treated as a Transferred Employee for all
purposes under this Agreement.  Until such date, the parties agree to enter into
an appropriate secondment agreement or other reasonable arrangement for the
availability of such International Employees and Visa Employees to the Company.

          (d)   During the period between the date hereof and the Closing Date,
AMD will use its Reasonable Efforts to ensure that certain AMD employees
mutually agreed upon by AMD and LLC are available for interview by LLC (acting
on behalf of the Company) for possible employment with the Company following the
Closing Date, and the Company (with LLC's consent), in its discretion, may make
offers of employment to any of such employees.

          (e)   The Company shall not assume, and AMD shall retain all
obligations to fund or otherwise shall provide all benefits in respect of or
payable under, AMD's Plans and Programs. No assets or liabilities of any of
AMD's Plans and Programs shall be transferred from such Plans and Programs to
any plan maintained or established by the Company, except for the AMD Flexible
Benefits Plan and the flexible spending accounts under such plan or as set forth
under Section 8.4(f).

          (f)   (i)  No later than the Closing Date, effective as of the Closing
Date, AMD shall amend its defined contribution plan in which Transferred
Employees participate (the "AMD Saving Plan") to cause the account balances of
                            ---------------
each Transferred Employee thereunder to vest as of each employee's respective
Hire Date and to cause their active participation in the AMD Saving Plan to
cease as of their respective Hire Dates.

                (ii) Unless LLC (acting on behalf of the Company) elects the
option set forth in subsection (iii) of this Section no later than the Closing
Date, AMD shall take any steps necessary to permit the Transferred Employees to
receive a distribution of their accrued benefits from the AMD Saving Plan as a
result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided the terms of
such plan would permit such a distribution. On or following the Closing Date,
the savings plan of the Company or one of its Affiliates (the "Company DC Plan")
                                                               ---------------
shall (if elected by the Transferred Employees) accept individual rollovers in
cash and, if permitted, promissory notes reflecting participants' loans under
the AMD Saving Plan of Transferred Employees' distributions from the AMD Saving
Plan, subject to the terms and conditions of the Company DC Plan and applicable
law.  The Company's obligations under this subsection (ii) are contingent upon
receipt by the Company of a favorable determination letter or AMD's

                                       29
<PAGE>

certification to the Company, in a manner reasonably acceptable to the Company,
that the AMD Saving Plan is qualified under the applicable provisions of the
Code.

                (iii) LLC (on behalf of the Company) may elect at its option no
later than the Closing Date, in lieu of the distribution provided for in
subsection (ii) of this Section, as soon as practicable following receipt by AMD
and the Company of favorable determination letters relating to the AMD Saving
Plan or Company DC Plan being qualified under the applicable provision of the
Code, to have AMD cause the trustee of the AMD Saving Plan to transfer assets
representing the full account balances of the Transferred Employees, together
with the appropriate net investment return (including unrealized appreciation or
depreciation) thereon, if applicable, reduced by any necessary benefit or
withdrawal payments made in respect of Transferred Employees prior to the actual
date of transfer, to the trustee of the Company DC Plan.  The assets to be
transferred from the trust under the AMD Saving Plan pursuant to this Section
8.4(f) shall be in cash or, to the extent mutually agreed to by AMD and the
Company, a combination of cash, securities and other property; provided,
however, that any outstanding loans attributable to the accounts of the
Transferred Employees shall be transferred in kind, if transferred, the actual
amount transferred from the trust under the AMD Saving Plan shall be adjusted to
reflect any normal and reasonable administrative expenses properly attributable
to the accounts of the Transferred Employees during the period following the
Closing Date.  At the time the assets that are held in the trust with respect to
the Transferred Employees under the AMD Saving Plan are paid to the trust under
the Company DC Plan, the Company DC Plan shall assume all liabilities of the AMD
Saving Plan for the applicable benefits so transferred, and such transfer shall
be in full discharge of all obligations of the AMD Saving Plan in respect
thereof.  If elected, this transfer shall take place as soon as practicable.
During the period following the Closing Date and preceding the transfer of
assets and liabilities pursuant to this Section 8.4(f)(iii), (1) AMD shall take
such action as is necessary to prevent a default by any Transferred Employee
with an outstanding loan from the AMD Saving Plan unless and until such
Transferred Employee fails to make a timely payment on such loan and (2) the
Company will cooperate with and assist AMD or its designee in the continued
administration of the AMD Saving Plan, including, subject to the consent of the
Transferred Employee, collecting and remitting to the trustee of the AMD Saving
Plan payroll deductions relating to any outstanding loans.  Notwithstanding the
above, the amount transferred to the trust under the Company DC Plan shall in no
event be less than the amount necessary to satisfy the requirements of Section
414(1) of the Code and ERISA.  If the Company elects such option, on or
immediately prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall (i) establish or
designate one or more of the Company DC Plan, and furnish AMD with the most
recent favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service relating
to the Company DC Plan or certification, in a manner reasonably acceptable to
AMD, that the Company DC Plan is qualified under applicable provisions of the
Code as promptly as practicable, (ii) take any necessary action to qualify the
Company DC Plan under the applicable provisions of the Code and (iii) make all
filings and submissions to appropriate governmental agencies required of it in
connection with a transfer of assets as described herein.

          (g)   LLC shall cause the Company to take all action reasonably
necessary and appropriate to provide that Transferred Employees shall, effective
as of the Hire Date (but subject to subsections (i) and (j)), be entitled to
participate in plans or programs established or

                                       30
<PAGE>

amended by the Company that provide coverages and benefits which in the
aggregate are substantially comparable to the coverages and benefits provided by
the Plans and Programs of AMD in which such Transferred Employees participated
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

          (h)   To the extent the Company is unable to establish health and/or
dental plans and programs in accordance with this Section, the parties mutually
agree to cooperate to execute an arrangement pursuant to which AMD will use its
Reasonable Efforts to provide such health and/or dental benefits to Transferred
Employees for a transitional period not to exceed sixty (60) days following the
Closing Date at a cost consistent with the historical costs associated with such
benefit plans plus certain administrative fees.  The cost of such coverage and
fees shall promptly be paid to AMD by the Company.

          (i)   Subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by Applicable
Law, LLC shall cause the Company to (i) make participation in employee welfare
benefit plans available to Transferred Employees on the Hire Date or as soon as
practicable thereafter and (ii) cause its employee welfare benefit plans and
programs to provide coverage to the Transferred Employees without regard to any
waiting period, evidence and requirement of insurability, preexisting condition,
actively at work requirement or exclusion or limitation (except to the extent
and in the manner any such waiting period, evidence and requirement of
insurability, preexisting condition, actively at work requirement or exclusion
or limitation applies immediately prior to the Closing).

          (j)   Subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by Applicable
Law, LLC agrees to cause the Company to (i) for purposes of determining
eligibility to become a participant in its employee pension benefit plans and
programs and its employee welfare benefit plans and programs, to treat a
Transferred Employee's service with AMD or any of its predecessors or affiliates
since last date of hire through the Hire Date as service with the Company, (ii)
for purposes of determining vesting in its employee pension benefit plans and
programs, to treat a Transferred Employee's service with AMD or any of its
predecessors or affiliates since last date of hire through the Hire Date as
service with the Company and (iii) for purposes of vacations, seniority and
other programs and benefits which consider service, to treat a Transferred
Employee's service with AMD or any of its predecessors or affiliates since last
date of hire through the Hire Date as service with the Company.

          (k)   AMD agrees to provide LLC and the Company with such records as
LLC may reasonably request regarding service of and participation by the CPD
Employees prior to the Hire Date in AMD's Plans and Programs.

          (l)   No provision in this Agreement shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any CPD Employee or Transferred Employee (or any
beneficiaries, dependents, or collective bargaining representatives thereof),
with respect to the terms and conditions of employment of any such CPD Employee
or Transferred Employee, including, but not limited to, the type or level of
compensation or benefits provided by LLC, the Company or AMD.

          (m)   The Company shall be liable for continuation of health care
coverage required by Code Section 4980B and ERISA Sections 601 through 608
("COBRA") with respect to any "qualifying event" (as defined in Section
  -----
4980B(f)(3) of the Code) with respect to a

                                       31
<PAGE>

Transferred Employee (and covered family members of a Transferred Employee)
occurring after such employee's respective Hire Date, including termination. AMD
shall be liable for health care continuation required by COBRA for any of its
employees who are not Transferred Employees.

          (n)  AMD agrees that it will pay any and all amounts due with respect
to any accrued vacation balance as of the Closing Date and accrued personal paid
absences as of the Closing Date to (i) any Transferred Employee on the Closing
Date and (ii) any Inactive Employee, Visa Employee or International Employee on
the date that such Inactive Employee, Visa Employee or International Employee
becomes a Transferred Employee.

          8.5  Additional Audited Financial Statements.
               ---------------------------------------

          AMD shall use its Reasonable Efforts to deliver to LLC an audited
balance sheet of the Business as of December 27, 1998 and audited income
statements and statement of cash flows of the Business for the years ended
December 28, 1997 and December 27, 1998, each prepared in accordance with GAAP,

          8.6  Noncompetition.
               --------------

          (a)  AMD agrees that, for the period from the Closing to the date
which is the second anniversary of the Closing Date, neither AMD nor any of
AMD's controlled Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, for its own benefit or
as agent of another, carry on or own, manage or operate, participate in, or
control the management or operation of, or allow its name to be used in, the
Communications Products Business (i) in the State of California, (ii) in the
State of Texas and (iii) in the United States of America. For purposes of this
Section 8.6, the "Communications Products Business" shall mean the design,
manufacture and sale of (1) communications infrastructure equipment including,
but not limited to, Subscriber Line Interface Circuits (SLIC), Subscriber Line
Audio processing Circuits (SLAC), and integrated circuits designed for and
dedicated to the communication of voice or voice and data over public and
private communications networks, (2) integrated circuits designed for and
dedicated to communication of voice or voice and data over cordless telephones,
(3) integrated circuits designed for and dedicated to communication of voice or
voice and data over wireless telephones (specifically excluding data only

          (b)  Nothing contained herein shall (i) limit AMD (A) from acquiring
(including through a merger) or investing in any business, development
arrangement or joint venture whose primary activities do not constitute a
Communications Products Business, or (B) from, directly or indirectly, holding
or making investments in securities of any business listed on a national
securities exchange, admitted to trading in an automated quotations market
traded generally on the over-the-counter market, so long as AMD's direct or
indirect holdings do not exceed 5% of the outstanding equity securities thereof,
or (ii) apply to the activities of any Person merging with or into AMD, or
acquiring, directly or indirectly, the equity securities of, or control of, AMD,
provided that such activities have been conducted prior to such merger or

          (c)  AMD recognizes and agrees that compliance with the covenant
contained in this Section 8.6 is necessary to protect LLC and the Company and
that a breach by AMD of any of the covenants set forth in this Section 8.6 could
cause irreparable harm to LLC, that LLC's remedies at law in the event of such
breach would be inadequate, and that, accordingly, in the event of such breach,
a restraining order or injunction or both may be issued against AMD, in addition
to any other rights and remedies which are available to LLC. If this Section 8.6
is more restrictive than permitted by the law of any jurisdiction in which LLC
seeks enforcement hereof, this Section 8.6 shall be limited to the extent
required to permit enforcement under such laws. In particular, the parties
intend that the covenants in the preceding portions of this Section 8.6 shall be
construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each location specified.
Except for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed
identical in terms. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce any of the separate covenants deemed included in this Section 8.6, then
such unenforceable covenant shall be deemed eliminated from these provisions for
the purpose of those proceedings to the extent necessary to permit the remaining
separate covenants to be enforced. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine the foregoing covenant to be unenforceable with respect to the term or
the scope of the subject matter or geography covered thereby, then such covenant
shall nevertheless be enforceable by such court against the other party upon
such shorter term or within such lesser scope as may be determined by such court
to be reasonable and enforceable.

          8.7  Distributor Price Adjustments. The Company will, within 15 days
               -----------------------------
after the end of the month in which the Closing occurs, provide AMD with a
statement of distributor price adjustments for the period on and before the
Closing Date. AMD will promptly pay the Company the amount of the distributor
price adjustments for the period on and before the Closing Date.

          8.8  Required Consents. To the extent that any Required Consent is not
               -----------------
obtained on or before the Closing Date, AMD will use its Reasonable Efforts for
a reasonable period of time following the Closing to obtain such Required
Consent as soon as practicable after the Closing Date.

          9.1  Tax Returns Through the Closing Date; Cooperation.
               -------------------------------------------------

          (a)  AMD shall include the income of the Company on AMD's consolidated
federal income Tax Returns for all periods through the Closing Date and timely
pay any federal income Taxes attributable to such income.  All such Tax Returns
(i) will be filed when due in accordance with all applicable laws and (ii) will
be true and complete in all material respects.  The Company shall furnish Tax
information to AMD for inclusion in AMD's federal consolidated income Tax Return
for the period that includes the Closing Date in accordance with AMD's past
custom and practice.  The income of the Company shall be apportioned to the
period up to and including the Closing Date and the period after the Closing
Date by closing the books of the Company as of the end of the Closing Date.

          (b)  AMD shall prepare and file with the appropriate authorities all
Tax Returns of the Company not covered by Section 9.1(a) hereof for all taxable
periods of the Company ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing
                                                                -----------
Periods"), and shall timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns.
- -------
All such Tax Returns (i) will be filed when due in accordance with all
applicable laws and (ii) will be true and complete in all material respects.

          (c)  LLC shall cause the Company to prepare and file with the
appropriate authorities all Tax Returns of the Company for all taxable periods
beginning after the Closing Date ("Post-Closing Periods") and all complete
                                   --------------------
taxable periods that include, but do not end on, the Closing Date ("Straddle
                                                                    --------
Periods"), and shall timely pay all Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns;
- -------
provided, however, that (i) LLC shall not permit the Company to file a Tax
Return in respect of a Straddle Period without AMD's prior written consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and (ii) AMD shall reimburse the
Company for any Taxes owed by the Company with respect to the portion of any
Straddle Period related to the Pre-Closing Period. For purposes of allocating
Taxes to the portion of any Straddle Period related to the Pre-Closing Period,
to the extent permitted by law and administrative practice, the Straddle Period
shall be treated as closing on (and including) the Closing Date. In the case of
any Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period that is not treated under the
preceding sentence as closing on the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
related to the Pre-Closing Period shall be deemed to be: (i) in the case of
real, personal and intangible property Taxes ("Property Taxes") of the Company
                                               --------------
for the Pre-Closing Period, the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period shall
be equal to the amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during
the Straddle Period that are in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period, and (ii) the Taxes of the
Company other than Property Taxes for the Pre-Closing Period shall be computed
as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date.

          (d)  AMD, the Company, and LLC shall reasonably cooperate and shall
cause their respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns
relating to Taxes, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes. In that
connection, as soon as practicable, but in any event within 45 days after it is
requested by LLC or AMD after the Closing Date, the other party will deliver to
the requesting party such information and data concerning the pre-Closing
operations of the Company and make available such knowledgeable employees of the
Company as such requesting party may reasonably request, including providing
information and data required by the requesting party's customary tax and
accounting questionnaires, in order to enable the requesting party to complete
and file all forms and reports which it may be required to file as to the
operations of the Company through the Closing Date or to otherwise enable the
requesting party to satisfy its internal accounting, tax and other legitimate
requirements. In addition to the foregoing, AMD and LLC agree, and LLC agrees to
cause the Company (i) to use the respective party's Reasonable Efforts to
properly retain and maintain all records related to Taxes of the Company for all
Pre-Closing Periods until such time as the other party agrees (which agreement
shall not be unreasonably withheld) that such retention and maintenance is no
longer necessary (but in no event shall such retention be required for more

                                       34

than five years), and (ii) to allow LLC and AMD, as the case may be, and their
respective agents and representatives (and agents and representatives of their
affiliates), at times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect,
review and make copies of such records as the requesting party may deem
necessary and appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted
during normal business hours and at the requesting party's expense.

          9.2  Tax Indemnification.
               -------------------

          (a)  AMD hereby indemnifies each LLC Indemnified Party against and
agrees to hold each LLC Indemnified Party harmless from any (w) Tax of the
Company described in clause (i) of the definition of Tax related to a Pre-
Closing Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period, (x) Tax
described in clause (ii) or (iii) of the definition of Tax, (y) Tax of the
Company resulting from a breach of the provisions of Section 3.13 or Article IX,
and (z) liabilities, costs, expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
expenses of investigation and attorneys' fees and expenses), losses, damages,
assessments, settlements or judgments arising out of or incident to the
imposition, assessment or assertion of any Tax described in (w), (x) or (y), and
any liability as transferee (the sum of (w), (x), (y), and (z) being referred to
herein as a "Tax Loss").

          (b)  With respect to any claim that is made by any taxing authority
which, if successful, might result in an indemnity payment to LLC or any of its
affiliates indemnified hereunder (a "Tax Claim") (other than a Tax Claim
                                     ---------
relating to Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period), AMD shall, at its sole
expense control all proceedings, including but not limited to audits, taken in
connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and, without
limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any taxing
authority with respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion, either pay the
Tax claimed and sue for a refund where applicable law permits such refund suits
or contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided, however, that AMD
shall not take any position or enter into any settlement with respect to any
such proceeding which materially adversely affects the tax liability of LLC, any
of its Affiliates, or, on or after the Closing Date, the Company (including but
not limited to the basis of the Company in the CPD Assets and the allocation of
such basis), without the prior written consent of LLC.  With respect to any such
Tax Claims as to which AMD asserts control, AMD shall not assert that such Tax
Claim (or portion thereof) is not within the ambit of Section 9.2(a). AMD and
LLC shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any Tax Claim
relating to Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period.  In no case shall LLC,
the Company, or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
stockholders, agents or representatives settle or otherwise compromise any Tax
Claim without AMD's written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
Neither party shall settle a Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the Company for any
Straddle Period without the other party's prior written consent, which shall not
be unreasonably withheld.  LLC, the Company, and each of their respective
Affiliates shall cooperate with AMD in contesting any Tax Claim, which
cooperation shall include, without limitation, the retention and (upon AMD's
reasonable request) the provision to AMD of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or

                                       35
<PAGE>

explanation or any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings
relating to such Tax Claim.

          (c)  Upon payment by any LLC Indemnified Party of any Tax Loss, AMD
shall discharge its obligation to indemnify LLC Indemnified Party against such
Tax Loss by payment to LLC an amount equal to the amount of such Tax Loss;
provided, however, that if LLC provides AMD with written notice of a Tax Loss at
least 60 days prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Loss is required to be
paid by any LLC Indemnified Party, AMD shall discharge its obligation to
indemnify LLC against Tax Loss by paying, as directed by LLC, an amount equal to
the amount of such Tax Loss. Any payment pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall be
made not later than 60 days after receipt by AMD of written notice from LLC in
accordance with the foregoing proviso or stating that any Tax Loss has been
incurred by a LLC Indemnified Party and the amount thereof and of the indemnitee
payment requested. The payment by a LLC Indemnified Party of any Tax Loss shall
not relieve AMD of its obligation under this Section 9.2.

          (d)  Any claim of any LLC Indemnified Party (other than LLC) under
this Section may be made and enforced by LLC on behalf of such LLC Indemnified
Party.

          9.3  Refunds. AMD shall be entitled to any refunds or credits
               -------
(including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) in respect of any
liability for any Tax of AMD or any of its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, the Company), for any Tax periods or portion thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date (including any Taxes allocated to such period under
Section 9.1(c) hereof) or for which AMD is otherwise liable under this
Agreement. The Company shall be entitled to any refunds or credits (including
any interest paid or credited with respect thereto) in respect of any liability
for any Tax of the Company or any of its Affiliates, for any Tax periods or
portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date (including any Taxes allocated
to such period under Section 9.1(c) hereof) and for which AMD does not have an
indemnification obligation under this Agreement. Each party shall cause any
amount to which the other party is entitled under this Section 9.3, but which is
received or credited to the party not so entitled or any of such party's
Affiliates, at any time after the Closing Date, to be paid to the party so
entitled in immediately available funds promptly after receipt (or, if the
amount of the credit or refund is applied against any other liability of the
party not so entitled, within ten days of the notice of such application).

          9.4  Conduct of Business on Closing Date. On the Closing Date, LLC
               -----------------------------------
shall cause the Company to conduct its business in the ordinary course in
substantially the same manner as presently conducted and shall not permit the
Company to effect any extraordinary transactions (other than any such
transactions expressly required by applicable law or by this Agreement) (or any
Ancillary Agreement) that could result in Tax liability for the Company in
excess of the Tax liability associated with the conduct of its business in the
ordinary course.

          9.5  Tax Sharing Agreements. AMD shall cause the provisions of any Tax
               ----------------------
sharing agreement between AMD and any of its Affiliates (other than the
Company), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, to be terminated
on or before the Closing Date.

          9.6  Changes to Elections, Etc. Without the prior written consent of
               -------------------------
LLC, none of AMD, the Company and any Affiliate of AMD shall, to the extent it
may affect or relate to the Company, make or change any Tax election, change any
annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file
any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax claim
or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment or take or omit to take any other action, if any such action or
omission would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability of the
Company, LLC or any Affiliate of LLC in respect of any Post-Closing Period.
Without AMD's prior written consent, LLC shall not cause or permit the Company
and any other Affiliate of LLC to make or change any Tax election, change any
annual Tax accounting period, adopt or change any method of Tax accounting, file
any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement, settle any Tax Claim
or assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, consent to any
extension or waiver of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment or take or omit to take any other action, if such action or omission
would have the effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or materially
reducing any Tax asset of AMD or any of its Affiliates in respect of any Pre-
Closing Period.

          9.7   Characterization as Price Adjustment. All amounts paid pursuant
                ------------------------------------
to this Agreement by one party to another party (other than interest payments)
shall be treated by such parties as an adjustment to the Stock Purchase Price.

          9.8   Allocation of Sales Price. Within sixty days after the Closing
                -------------------------
Date, LLC shall provide AMD with its proposed allocation of the sale price to
the CPD Assets. LLC and AMD agree to cooperate in good faith to reach an agreed
allocation of federal income tax basis to the CPD Assets. LLC and AMD shall file
all Tax Returns in a manner which is consistent with the federal income tax
treatment of the transaction set forth herein or determined pursuant to this
provision.

          9.9   Texas Transfer Tax Matters. LLC and AMD intend to treat the
                --------------------------
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements as an
"occasional sale" within the meaning of section 151.304 of the Texas Limited
Sales, Excise and Use Tax Act, and AMD will treat such transactions consistently
therewith on the return required to be filed it for Texas Limited Sales, Excise
and Use Tax purposes for the taxable period to which such transactions relate.

          9.10  Tax Treatment. LLC and AMD agree that the transactions
                ------------
contemplated by this Agreement and the Reorganization Agreement are intended to
constitute a taxable sale of the CPD Assets by AMD and agree to treat such
transactions consistently therewith for all income tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by an applicable taxing authority (which requirement is not
initiated by AMD).

forth in Section 3.13 shall survive the Closing for the applicable statute of
limitations, at which time such representations and warranties shall expire and
terminate; (ii) the obligation of AMD to indemnify LLC for any loss arising out
of any Retained Liabilities pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i), shall survive the

representations, warranties, covenants and agreements provided herein shall not
affect the rights of a party in respect of any claim made by such party in a

     representation, covenant or agreement of AMD contained in this Agreement,

     the definition of Retained Liabilities) or (C) Intellectual Property

                (ii)  Subject to Section 10.1, subsequent to the Closing Date,
     LLC shall indemnify AMD, its Affiliates, and each of their respective
     partners, officers, directors, employees, stockholders and agents (the "AMD
                                                                             ---

     incident to, arise out of, are in connection with, or are related to,
     whether directly or indirectly, (A) the breach of any warranty,
     representation, covenant or agreement of LLC contained in this Agreement,
     (B) the Assumed Liabilities (except for those Liabilities with respect to
     which any LLC Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from AMD
     pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)(A)) or (C) the ownership and operation of
     the Business or the Company from and after the Closing.

          (b)   Procedure For Claims. If a claim for Losses (a "Claim") is to be
                --------------------                            -----
made by a Person entitled to indemnification hereunder, the Person claiming such
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall give written notice (a "Claim
                      -----------------                                 -----
Notice") to the indemnifying Person (the "Indemnifying Party") as soon as
- ------                                    ------------------
practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition or
event which may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought
under this Section 10.2.  The failure of any Indemnified Party to give timely
notice hereunder shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder, except to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates actual damage caused by such
failure.  In the case of a Claim involving the assertion of a claim by a third
party (whether pursuant to a lawsuit or other legal action or otherwise, a
"Third-Party Claim"), (A) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, if it so
 ------------------
elects, at its own cost, risk and expense, (1) to take control of the defense
and investigation of such Third-Party Claim and (2) to pursue the defense
thereof by appropriate actions or proceedings, including, without limitation, to
employ and engage attorneys of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Party to handle and defend the same, and (B) the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled (but not obligated), if it so elects, to compromise or settle
such claim, which compromise or settlement shall be made only with the written
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.
In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense and
investigation of such lawsuit or other legal action in accordance with this
Section 10.2(b), the Indemnified Party may, at its own cost and expense,
participate in the investigation, trial and defense of such Third-Party Claim.
If the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim
in accordance with this Section 10.2 within 30 calendar days after receipt of
the Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party against which such Third-Party Claim has
been asserted shall (upon delivering notice to such effect to the Indemnifying
Party) have the right to undertake, at the Indemnifying Party's cost, risk and
expense, the defense, compromise and settlement of such Third-Party Claim on
behalf of and for the account of the Indemnifying Party; provided that such
Third-Party Claim shall not be compromised or settled without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of
the progress of any such defense, compromise or settlement, and in the event the
Indemnified Party assumes the defense of the claim, the Indemnified Party shall
keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably informed of the progress of any such
defense, compromise or settlement.  The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for
any settlement of any Third-Party Claim effected pursuant to and in accordance
with this Section 10.2 and for any final judgment (subject to any right of

                                       39
<PAGE>

appeal), and the Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Party from and against any and all Losses by reason of such
settlement or judgment.

                -----------------------------------

          (a)   Except as provided in Sections 10.3(c) and 10.3(d), LLC
Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover for any Losses pursuant to
this Article X until such time as the Losses claimed by LLC Indemnified Parties
in the aggregate exceed $6,000,000, and then only to the extent of such excess.

          (b)   Except as provided in Section 10.3(c), the maximum aggregate
amount of Losses for which AMD Indemnifying Parties shall be liable pursuant to
this Article X shall be $60,000,000.

          (c)   The thresholds and limitations set forth in this Section 10.3
shall not apply with respect to any Claim by an Indemnified Party with respect
to: (i) the Retained Liabilities (in the case of a Claim by a LLC Indemnified
Party); or (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed after
the Closing.

          (d)   With respect to the obligation of AMD Indemnifying Parties to
indemnify LLC Indemnified Parties for any Intellectual Property Liabilities
pursuant to Section 10.2(a)(i)(C), the maximum amount of Losses for which AMD
Indemnifying Parties shall be liable pursuant to this Article X shall be
$10,000,000. The threshold set forth in Section 10.3(a) shall not apply in the
case of a Claim by an LLC Indemnified Party with respect to any Intellectual
Property Liabilities.

          10.4  Insurance Proceeds.  To the extent that any Claim is covered by
                ------------------
insurance held by the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article X only with respect to the
amount of Losses that are in excess of the cash proceeds received by such
Indemnified Party pursuant to such insurance. If such Indemnified Party receives
such cash insurance proceeds prior to the time such Claim is paid, then the
amount payable by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to such Claim shall be reduced
by the amount of such insurance proceeds. If such Indemnified Party receives
such cash insurance proceeds after such Claim is paid, then upon receipt by the
Indemnified Party of any cash proceeds pursuant to such insurance with respect
to such Claim, such Indemnified Party shall repay any portion of such amount
which was previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party in
satisfaction of such Claim.

          10.5  Indemnification as Exclusive Remedy. Subsequent to the Closing,
                -----------------------------------
with respect to any matter as to which indemnification is provided pursuant to
Article IX or X of this Agreement, such indemnification shall be the sole remedy
available to the indemnified party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
hereto may exercise their rights under this Agreement and applicable law to
equitable remedies, including, without limitation, specific performance and
injunction.

party hereto; provided, however, that no party shall be released from liability
hereunder if this Agreement is terminated and the transactions abandoned by
reason of the failure of such party to have performed its obligations hereunder.

force and effect; provided, however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall
