Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Basis of Presentation

   The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements
present financial information for AMD giving effect to the sale of CPD, which
was consummated on August 4, 2000 effective as of July 31, 2000. The unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of July 2, 2000 is presented
as if the sale transaction had occurred as of that date. The unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated statements of operations for the six months ended July 2,
2000 and for the fiscal year ended December 26, 1999 are presented as if the
sale transaction had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period presented.

2. Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Financial Adjustments

[A] Reflects the sale of 90 percent of CPD, the part of the Communications
Group that produced telecommunication products, to Francisco Partners, L.P., a
private equity investment firm, for total cash proceeds of $375 million.
Included in pro forma retained earnings at July 2, 2000 is the resulting
estimated gain to be recognized on the sale, net of other expenses of the sale
transactions and compensation expense recorded in connection with options to
purchase AMD stock previously issued to CPD employees and applicable income
taxes, as if the sale transaction had occurred on July 2, 2000. The estimated
after-tax gain of approximately $211 million will be recorded in the third
quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2000. The actual after-tax gain
will be determined based on the amount by which the proceeds received from the
sale exceed the sum of the actual carrying value of CPD net assets as of
July 31, 2000 and direct costs associated with the sale. Pursuant to Article 11
of Regulation S-X, the estimated gain to be recognized on the disposition
transaction has been excluded from the pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the six months ended July 2, 2000 and the fiscal
year ended December 26, 1999 due to its non-recurring nature.

[B] Subsequent to the CPD sale, AMD will continue to provide wafer fabrication,
administrative and assembly, test, mark and pack services to CPD pursuant to
service agreements. The wafer fabrication and assembly, test, mark and pack
service agreements will continue to December 31, 2004, and the administrative
service agreements will expire on the 12-month anniversary of the closing date.
The pro forma adjustments to the condensed consolidated statements of operation
for the six months ended July 2, 2000 and the fiscal year ended December 26,
1999 reflect the sales and related expenses to CPD that were eliminated in the
historical information.

[C] The pro forma adjustment to income taxes in the condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of July 2, 2000 reflects an effective tax rate of 37% on the
sale. The pro-forma adjustment to income tax expense on the 1999 statement of
operations reflects the adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance.
