           AMD SEES FLAT TO NOMINALLY HIGHER FIRST QUARTER REVENUES

     SUNNYVALE, CA--FEBRUARY 11, 2000--Speaking at a Goldman-Sachs conference in
Palm Springs, California, AMD Chairman and Chief Executive Officer W.J. Sanders
III said he now expects the company to report flat to nominally higher
sequential sales in the current quarter.

     "Demand for low-end microprocessors has been stronger than expected," said
Sanders. "Business across the board continues to be robust. With better than
anticipated demand for low-end PC processors, we now expect that AMD's first-
quarter revenues will be flat to nominally higher than the record sales reported
in the seasonally strong fourth quarter. The ramp of the AMD Athlon(TM)
processor on 180-nanometer technology is proceeding as planned. One hundred
percent of our AMD Athlon production is now on 180-nanometer technology."

     AMD reported sales of $968,710,000 in the quarter ended December 26, 1999.

Cautionary Statement

     This release contains a forward-looking statement, which is made pursuant
to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, with respect to projected revenues for the quarter ending March 26, 2000.
Investors are cautioned that this forward-looking statement involves risks and
uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ materially from current
expectations. The forward-looking revenue projection in this release involves
the risk that demand for AMD's products will not continue at current or greater
levels; the risk that Intel Corporation pricing, marketing programs or other
activities targeting the company's microprocessor business will prevent
achievement of the company's current processor sales plans; that third parties
may not provide timely or adequate infrastructure solutions to support the AMD
Athlon(TM) processor; and that the company will not be able to manufacture and
ship product in the volumes, in the mix and for the prices currently assumed or
planned for the quarter. We urge investors to review in detail the risks and
uncertainties in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
including but not limited to the report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 26, 1999.
