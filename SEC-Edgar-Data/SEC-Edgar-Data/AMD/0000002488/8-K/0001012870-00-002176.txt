              AMD SAYS FIRST-QUARTER SALES WILL EXCEED $1 BILLION


     TOKYO, JAPAN -- April 5, 2000 -- Speaking at a news conference in Tokyo,
Japan, observing the 25th anniversary of AMD-Japan, Ltd., AMD Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer W.J. Sanders III said today he expects that the company will
report record sales in excess of $1 billion for its first quarter, which ended
April 2, 2000.

     Based on strong sales growth from all its product groups, Sanders said he
expects AMD will report revenue growth in the range of 10 percent over the
immediate-prior quarter to more than $1.06 billion when it announces results on
Wednesday, April 12. Both Flash memory and PC processors, led by the award-
winning AMD Athlon(TM) processor, reached new records in units and revenues.
Sanders said the company achieved its publicly stated goal of selling at least
1.2 million AMD Athlon processors during the quarter.

     "We believe we continued to gain unit share worldwide last quarter in the
PC processor segment," said Sanders. "Our PC processor unit market share in
Japan, at more than 20 percent, is somewhat higher than our worldwide share,
reflecting our participation in all segments of the Japanese market - consumer,
commercial, and mobile."

     AMD reported record sales of $968.7 million and earnings of $0.43 per
diluted share for the immediate-prior quarter, which ended December 26, 1999.
