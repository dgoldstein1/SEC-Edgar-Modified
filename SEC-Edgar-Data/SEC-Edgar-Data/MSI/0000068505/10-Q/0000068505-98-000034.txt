(consisting of normal recurring adjustments, reclassifications, and 
restructuring charges) necessary to present fairly the financial position, 
results of operations and cash flows at September 26, 1998 and for all 
periods presented.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial 
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these 
condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto incorporated by 
reference in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997.  
The results of operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended 
September 26, 1998 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results 
to be expected for the full year.  Certain amounts have been reclassified 
in the 1997 financial statements to conform to the 1998 presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

5.  Reorganization and Acquisition of Businesses

In the second quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring 
charge of $1.98 billion for the following types of costs: the consolidation 
of manufacturing operations throughout the Company with emphasis on the 
Semiconductor Products and Messaging, Information and Media segments; the 
exit of additional non-strategic, poorly-performing businesses; the 
writedown of assets which have become impaired either as a result of 
current business conditions or business portfolio decisions; and a 
reduction in employment by approximately 15,000 by the second quarter of 
1999 from the approximately 150,000 employees worldwide at the beginning of 
the second quarter of 1998.  The following table displays a rollforward of 
the restructuring accruals to September 26, 1998, by category:

==========================================================================

During the third quarter of 1998, the Company sold its printed circuit 
board business and exited several semiconductor product lines.  In 
addition, the Company signed a memorandum of understanding to sell its non-
silicon component manufacturing business to CTS Corp.  The business 
includes ceramics, quartz oscillator, piezoelectric technology and surface 
acoustic wave operations.

In 1997, the Company established restructuring accruals totaling $327 
million to exit its modem business in Huntsville, AL, to exit the 
MacOS(Registered)-compatible computer systems business, and to phase out 
participation in the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market.  Through 
September 26, 1998, $262 million of the accruals had been utilized, $31 
million had been reversed into income over the last several quarters, and 
the remaining $34 million is expected to be used by the end of 1998.

As of September 26, 1998, approximately 5,500 direct and 2,300 indirect 
employees have separated from the Company through a combination of 
voluntary and involuntary severance programs.  Direct employees are 
primarily non-supervisory production employees, and indirect employees are 
primarily non-production employees and production managers.

During the third quarter of 1998, the Company acquired the remaining 
outstanding shares of Starfish Software, Inc., a supplier of 
synchronization technology for wireless and wireline connected information 
devices.  The total acquisition cost was $253 million, consisting of cash, 
stock, assumed stock options and assumed liabilities.  In connection with 
this transaction, the Company recorded an in-process research and 
development charge of $109 million, which was included in the pre-tax net 
special charge of $18 million for the quarter as it was partially offset by 
gains on business and asset sales.  Pro forma effects of the acquisition 
are not material.

6.  Comprehensive Earnings(Loss)

SFAS No. 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income", which is solely a financial 
statement presentation standard, requires the Company to disclose non-owner 
changes included in equity but not included in net earnings(loss).  These 
changes include the fair value adjustments to certain cost-based 
investments, the foreign currency translation adjustments, and the minimum 
pension liability adjustment.  Comprehensive earnings(loss) for the three-
month periods ended September 26, 1998, and September 27, 1997, were ($234) 
million and $568 million, respectively.  Comprehensive earnings(loss) for 
the nine-month periods ended September 26, 1998, and September 27, 1997, 
were ($1.3) billion and $1.4 billion, respectively.


                      Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                    Management's Discussion and Analysis
              of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Company's 
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and 
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and 
results of operations incorporated by reference in the Company's Form 
10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997.

Results of Operations:

Sales were $7.2 billion in the third quarter of 1998, down 3 percent from 
$7.4 billion a year earlier.  In the first nine months, sales decreased 2 
percent to $21.1 billion from $21.5 billion in the first nine months of 
1997.

Excluding special charges, third-quarter earnings were $40 million, or 7 
cents per share after-tax in 1998, compared with $308 million, or 51 cents 
per share after-tax in the third quarter of 1997.  Excluding special 
charges, earnings for the nine months were $188 million, or 31 cents per 
share after-tax, compared with $986 million, or $1.62 per share after-tax a 
year earlier.

The third-quarter results reflect the continuing impact of adverse business 
conditions in Asia and weakness in semiconductors and paging products on a 
worldwide basis.  These negative factors were partially offset by some 
early benefits from Motorola's manufacturing consolidation, cost reduction 
and restructuring programs.

The Company recorded special charges of $18 million pre-tax, or 3 cents per 
share after-tax, in the third quarter of 1998.  These charges include a 
write-off in connection with the acquisition of Starfish Software, Inc., 
partially offset by gains on business and asset sales.  Including the 
special charges, third-quarter earnings were $27 million, or 4 cents per 
share after-tax, compared with $266 million, or 44 cents per share after-
tax, in the third quarter a year ago.  The year-earlier quarter included 
special charges against pre-tax earnings of $65 million, or 7 cents per 
share after-tax, largely from the decision to exit the MacOS (Registered) 
compatible computer systems business.

In the first nine months of 1998, the loss, including special charges, was 
$1.1 billion, or $1.87 per share after-tax, compared with earnings of $859 
million, or $1.41 per share after-tax, in last year's first nine months.  
This year's loss includes special charges of $1.9 billion pre-tax, or $2.18 
per share after-tax, largely as a result of charges associated with a 
comprehensive series of manufacturing consolidations, cost reductions and 
restructuring steps intended to improve financial performance.  The year-
earlier period also includes special charges against pre-tax earnings of 
$196 million, or 21 cents per share after-tax, largely from the phase-out 
of the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) business and the decision to 
exit the MacOs(Registered)-compatible computer systems business.

In July, the Company's communications-related businesses were 
realigned into the Communications Enterprise, a structure intended to 
enable integrated solutions and improved responsiveness to the needs 
of distinct customer segments, including consumers, 
telecommunications network operators, and commercial, government and 
industrial users of telecommunications equipment.  For this quarter's 
financial reporting purposes, the Company continues to use the 
previous segments, pending a restatement at a later date.

Cellular Products Segment sales increased 9 percent to $3 billion and 
orders were down 2 percent.  Operating profits were higher due to gains on 
business and asset sales.  Excluding those gains, operating profits would 
have declined, largely due to increased research and development investment 
in digital cellular technologies.

Cellular Subscriber Sector (CSS) sales and orders declined.  However, sales 
and orders of digital products increased significantly versus last year.  
This was offset by a very significant decline in sales of analog products, 
caused by a continuing trend of demand shift to digital products.  In Asia, 
sales and orders were significantly higher, while they were significantly 
lower in Pan America and slightly lower in Europe.  GSM phone sales showed 
a strong sequential increase due to rapid acceptance of new products 
announced earlier in 1998, including the cd900 series phones.

Cellular Infrastructure Group (CIG) sales increased significantly and 
orders were higher.  In Japan and Europe both sales and orders were 
significantly higher, while they were lower in Pan America and 
significantly lower in Asia.  The cellular infrastructure business has been 
historically characterized by large orders and irregular purchasing 
patterns which can cause volatility in quarterly growth rates.

Land Mobile Products Segment sales increased 3 percent to $1.3 billion, 
orders increased 20 percent and operating profits were higher.  Orders for 
iDEN (Registered) equipment for integrated digital enhanced networks were 
significantly higher.  New iDEN systems began operations in the greater 
Tokyo area, Rio de Janeiro, Manila and Singapore.

Messaging, Information and Media Segment sales decreased 38 percent to $552 
million and orders were 10 percent lower.  The segment had an operating 
loss versus a profit a year ago, due to the decline in sales and the write-
off related to the acquisition of Starfish Software, Inc., a supplier of 
synchronization technology for wireless and wireline connected information 
devices.  Paging Group orders were lower than a year ago due to a 
significant decline in Asia, only partly offset by higher orders in Pan 
America.  Paging Group sales were significantly lower than a year ago in 
all regions.

Space and Systems Technology Group Sales increased 12 percent, orders were 
down 87 percent, and operating profits increased.  The decline in orders is 
related to the timing of contractual milestones on the Iridium(Registered) 
program. The results are reported as part of the "Other Products" segment.  
Operational and voice quality testing of the Iridium system continued 
during the quarter.  Gateway operators have now conditionally accepted 12 
Iridium gateways around the world.  Commercial voice service began on 
November 1.  

As previously reported, Iridium Operating LLC and/or Iridium LLC 
(collectively "Iridium") may require additional financing, possibly before 
the end of 1998, to continue to make contractual payments to the Company.  
As reported by Iridium, it has a senior secured bank facility which matures 
on December 31, 1998. Iridium will need to refinance this facility and seek 
additional financing in order to meet its funding requirements. Given the 
current strain on liquidity in worldwide capital markets, it may be more 
difficult for Iridium to raise all of the additional financing it needs.

The Company has provided and continues to provide financial support to 
Iridium.  As of early 1997, the Company had agreed to guarantee $750 
million of Iridium bank financing and had conditionally offered to 
guarantee an additional $350 million of Iridium bank financing. Currently, 
the conditional offer to guarantee an additional $350 million remains in 
place.  However, the Company's existing guarantee has been reduced to $275 
million, although that amount could significantly increase depending on 
Iridium's financing needs and the outcome of current negotiations between 
the Company and Iridium and between Iridium and its lenders.

The Company has contracts with Iridium under which it constructed and 
deployed the satellite constellation and is to maintain the performance of 
the satellite constellation and to provide certain computer systems, 
functionality and software for the system.  In connection with these 
relationships, the Company has accounts receivables from Iridium which, as 
of September 26, 1998, totaled $283 million.  

The Company has also agreed to conditionally guarantee up to $175 million 
of additional Iridium bank financing, the proceeds of which are to be used 
to purchase subscriber equipment for the Iridium system from the Company.  
This guarantee may be called upon if the Iridium gateway operators do not 
purchase minimum amounts of subscriber equipment from the Company, and 
Iridium, per its agreement with the Company, purchases or finances the 
purchase of such equipment from the Company.  Based on gateway operators' 
early purchases as the system begins commercial service, the Company 
anticipates that these minimum orders will be met or substantially met.  

At September 26, 1998, the Company also held, at an original value of $156 
million, Iridium Operating LLC's 14-1/2% Senior Subordinated Discount Notes 
due 2006.  The Notes accrete in value until as late as July 10, 2001, at 
which time the accreted value of all Notes currently held by the Company 
will be $315 million. When the Notes reach their full accreted value, 
interest begins to accrue at 14-1/2% per annum payable semi-annually in 
cash, with the first interest payment on the Notes scheduled to occur on 
September 1, 2001.

Semiconductor Products Segment sales decreased 14 percent to $1.8 billion 
and orders were 10 percent lower.  The sector had an operating loss versus 
a profit a year ago, due to the decline in sales and lower average selling 
prices resulting from a worldwide industry recession.  Orders were higher 
in the Networking & Computing and Transportation Systems groups, down 
slightly in Wireless Subscriber Systems and down significantly in the 
Consumer Systems and Semiconductor Components groups.  By region, orders 
grew slightly in Europe and Asia-Pacific, were down in the Americas, and 
were down significantly in Japan.

Automotive, Component, Computer and Energy Sector Sales declined 12 percent 
and orders were down 10 percent.  The sector had an operating profit versus 
a loss a year ago, when a charge was taken to exit the MacOS(Registered)-
compatible computer systems business.  Excluding that charge, operating 
profits would have been lower than a year ago, largely due to the decline 
in sales.  The sector's results are reported as part of the "Other 
Products" segment.

The Company sold its printed circuit board business, which included two 
manufacturing operations in Singapore.  The Company also signed a 
memorandum of understanding to sell its non-silicon component products 
division to CTS Corp.  The businesses in the division include ceramics, 
quartz oscillator, piezoelectric technology and surface acoustic wave 
operations.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 20 percent of sales 
compared with 17 percent in the year-earlier period.  The increase as a 
percent of sales was due entirely to a write-off related to the acquisition 
of Starfish Software, Inc. and a larger Iridium equity loss.  Depreciation 
expense decreased slightly as a percent of sales.  Interest expense 
increased slightly as a percent of sales.  The tax rate for the third 
quarter was 30 percent versus a 35 percent tax rate a year ago.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

Operating activities used $137 million in cash for the nine-month 
period ended September 26, 1998, as compared to providing $1.9 
billion in cash for the nine-month period ended September 27, 1997.  
The change in cash flow was due primarily to lower earnings.

Inventories at September 26, 1998 increased by 5 percent or $194 
million, compared to inventories at December 31, 1997.  Property, 
plant and equipment, less accumulated depreciation, increased $101 
million since December 31, 1997.

The Company's notes payable and current portion of its long-term debt 
increased to $3.6 billion at September 26, 1998, from $1.3 billion at 
December 31, 1997.  Net debt (notes payable and current portion of 
long-term debt plus long-term debt less short-term investments and 
cash equivalents) to net debt plus equity increased to 28.4 percent 
at September 26, 1998 from 12.4 percent at December 31, 1997.  The 
Company's total domestic and foreign credit facilities aggregated 
$4.7 billion at September 26, 1998, of which $313 million were used 
and the remaining $4.4 billion were available to back up outstanding 
commercial paper which totaled $3.3 billion.

The significant increase in the Company's short-term borrowings can 
be attributed, generally, to the Company's need to finance its 
operations during a period of lower profitability.  Among other 
things, the additional cash has been necessary to provide for 
increased long-term customer financing, higher inventory levels, 
increased accounts receivable and, although diminishing, the 
Company's high level of capital expenditures.

At September 26, 1998, the off-balance sheet commitment to Nextel 
Communications, Inc. for equipment financing remained at $485 
million.  This amount represents the maximum available commitment and 
may not be completely used.

On September 28, 1998, the Company redeemed $368 million principal 
amount at maturity of its outstanding LYONs(Trademark) due 2013 at 
the election of the holders thereof.  The Company made a total 
payment of $263 million to redeem these LYONs.  The proceeds used for 
this redemption were obtained entirely from the issuance of 
commercial paper.  As of October 15, 1998, approximately $110 million 
principal amount at maturity of the Company's LYONs due 2013 remains 
outstanding.

On October 20, 1998, the Company sold an aggregate face principal 
amount at maturity of $325 million of 5.80% Notes due October 15, 
2008.  The net proceeds to the Company from the issuance and sale of 
the Notes were $322 million.  The Company intends to use the proceeds 
to reduce short-term indebtedness and for other general corporate 
purposes.

As a multinational company, the Company's transactions are 
denominated in a variety of currencies.  The Company uses financial 
instruments to hedge, and therefore attempts to reduce its overall 
exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.  The 
Company's policy is not to speculate in financial instruments for 
profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation, trade in currencies 
for which there are no underlying exposures, or enter into trades for 
any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.  
Instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk 
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a 
hedge at the inception of the contract.  Accordingly, changes in 
market values of hedge instruments must be highly correlated with 
changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception 
of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

The Company's strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues is to 
offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments against 
losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows or 
investments based on the operating business units' assessment of 
risk.  Currently, the Company primarily hedges firm commitments, 
including assets and liabilities currently on the balance sheet.  The 
Company expects that it may hedge anticipated transactions, 
forecasted transactions or investments in foreign subsidiaries in the 
future.

Almost all of the Company's non-functional currency receivables and 
payables which are denominated in major currencies that can be traded 
on open markets are hedged.  The Company uses forward contracts and 
options to hedge these currency exposures.  A portion of the 
Company's exposure is to currencies which are not traded on open 
markets, such as those in Latin America and China, and these are 
addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, through managing net 
asset positions, product pricing, and other means, such as component 
sourcing.

At September 26, 1998 and September 27, 1997, the Company had net 
outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling $1.9 billion and $1.7 
billion, respectively. The following schedule shows the five largest 
foreign exchange hedge positions as of September 26, 1998 and the 
corresponding positions at September 27, 1997:

Dollars in millions
Buy (Sell)              Sept. 26,          Sept. 27,
                         1998               1997
Japanese Yen             (596)              (359)
German Mark              (224)              (224)
British Pound Sterling   (210)              (496)
Italian Lira             (174)              (163)
Taiwan Dollar             (74)               (83)

At September 26, 1998 and September 27, 1997, outstanding foreign 
exchange contracts primarily consisted of short-term forward 
contracts.  Net deferred gains at September 26, 1998, and net 
deferred losses at September 27, 1997, on these forward contracts 
which hedge designated firm commitments were immaterial.

As of the end of the reporting period, the Company had no outstanding 
interest rate swaps, commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options 
relating to either its debt instruments or investments.  The Company 
does not have any derivatives to hedge the value of its equity 
investments in affiliated companies.

The Company's research and development expenditures for the three-month 
periods ended September 26, 1998, and September 27, 1997, were $732 million 
and $695 million, respectively.  Research and development expenditures for 
the nine-month periods ended September 26, 1998, and September 27, 1997, 
were $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.  The Company continues to 
believe that a strong commitment to research and development drives long-
term growth.  The Company's capital expenditures for the three-month 
periods ended September 26, 1998, and September 27, 1997, were $708 million 
and $831 million, respectively.  Capital expenditures for the nine-month 
periods ended September 26, 1998, and September 27, 1997, were $2.4 billion 
and $1.8 billion, respectively. For the full year of 1998, the Company's 
capital expenditures are now expected to total approximately $2.9 billion.  
The Company has reduced its capital expenditures forecast compared to 
original projections due in part to the continued weakness in the Company's 
semiconductor business as a result of the ongoing worldwide semiconductor 
industry recession.

Return on average invested capital (net earnings divided by the sum 
of stockholders' equity, long-term debt, notes payable and the 
current portion of long-term debt, less short-term investments and 
cash equivalents) was (5.3) percent based on the performance of the 
four preceding fiscal quarters ending September 26, 1998, compared 
with 7.8 percent based on the performance of the four preceding 
fiscal quarters ending September 27, 1997.  The Company's current 
ratio (the ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 1.16 
at September 26, 1998, compared to 1.46 at December 31, 1997.

Year 2000:

Motorola has been actively addressing Year 2000 issues since 1997.  A Year 
2000 Enterprise Council was formed and is responsible for coordinating and 
facilitating of activities across the Company.  The Year 2000 Enterprise 
Council reports to the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer and 
its progress is reported to the Management Board of the Company (which is 
comprised of the Company's most senior management) and the Audit and Legal 
Committee of the Board of Directors. 

The Year 2000 issue refers to the risk that systems, products and equipment 
having date-sensitive components will not recognize the Year 2000.  
Throughout this disclosure the Company uses the generic phrase "year 2000 
ready" to mean that a system, product or piece of equipment will perform 
its intended functions on or after January 1, 2000 the same as it did 
before January 1, 2000.  The Company also has a specific definition of Year 
2000 Ready for Motorola products described below. 

                        The Six-Phase Year 2000 Program

Motorola developed the Six-Phase Year 2000 Program to ensure a thorough and 
standard approach to addressing the Year 2000 problem across the Company.

The Program summarizes the tasks to be completed while leaving each 
business to tailor actions specifically to their environments, the goals of 
each phase, and their targeted completion dates.  The six-phases are 
Preliminary (identify the issues, create awareness, and dedicate 
resources); Discovery/Charter (inventory, categorize, and make initial cost 
estimates); Scope (refine inventory and assess business impacts and risks); 
Conversion Planning (determine specific implementation solutions through 
analysis, formulate strategies, and develop project and test plans); 
Conversion (make program changes, perform applications and acceptance 
testing and certification); and Deployment and Post Implementation (deploy 
program and software changes, evaluate and apply lessons learned).

                           The Company's Readiness

As of September 26, 1998, all of the Company's sectors and groups have 
substantially completed Phases 1-4, have partially completed Phase 5, and 
expect to complete a substantial portion of the work under the 6 phases by 
December 31, 1998.  However, certain of the work will continue well into 
1999.  This work will be separately monitored and tracked with appropriate 
target completion dates.  Contingency plans will be developed for any 
matter not resolved in 1998 that may have a material negative impact on 
Motorola's final "year 2000 readiness".

As part of the Company's overall program and to ensure adequate means to 
measure progress, Motorola has established five functional categories to be 
reviewed by each business as follows:

Products.  While addressing all five functional categories, the Company has 
placed a high priority on ensuring that Motorola products are Year 2000 
Ready and is completing a comprehensive review of the Year 2000 Readiness 
of Motorola products.  The results of these reviews are being made 
available to Motorola customers and third parties through the use of a 
Motorola Year 2000 web-site and is supplemented with additional written 
communications.  The Motorola definition of "Year 2000 Ready", which is the 
standard Motorola uses to determine the Year 2000 Readiness of Motorola 
products, is as follows:

     Year 2000 Ready means the capability of a Motorola Product, when 
     used in accordance with it's associated documentation, to 
     correctly process, provide and/or receive date-data in and 
     between the years 1999 and 2000, including leap year 
     calculations, provided that all other products and systems (for 
     example, hardware, software and firmware) used with the Motorola 
     Product properly exchange accurate date-data with it.

Manufacturing.  Some of the tools and equipment (hardware and software) 
used to develop and manufacture Motorola products are date-sensitive.  The 
Company believes, based on the results of the Six-Phase Program and based 
on assurances from its suppliers, that the critical tools and equipment 
used by it to manufacture products will be "year 2000 ready" or will be 
made ready through upgrades by the suppliers of the tools or equipment.  As 
a result the Company does not expect significant interruption to its 
manufacturing capabilities because of the failure of tools and/or 
equipment. 

Non-Manufacturing Business Applications.  Throughout the business the Company is
fixing and testing all non-manufacturing business applications such as core 
financial information and reporting systems, procurement, human 
resources/payroll, factory applications, customer service systems, and revenue 
systems, and does not expect any significant Year 2000 problems in this area.

Facilities and Infrastructure.  The Company also is fixing and testing its 
facilities and infrastructure (health, safety and environment systems, 
buildings, security/alarms/doors, desktop computers, networks) to ensure 
they are "year 2000 ready" and does not expect significant interruption to 
its operations because of Year 2000 problems with its facilities and 
infrastructure. 

Logistics.  The Company has devoted significant resources to ensure that 
its operations are not disrupted because of services or products supplied 
to the Company.  In addition, the Company has requested assurances from its 
joint venture partners and alliance partners of their "year 2000 
readiness". 

Of critical importance to the Company's Year 2000 Readiness is the 
readiness of suppliers and the products the Company procures from 
suppliers.  Motorola has many thousands of suppliers and has a 
comprehensive program to identify and obtain Year 2000 information from its 
critical suppliers.  The program includes awareness letters, site visits, 
questionnaires, compliance agreements and warranties as well as a review of 
suppliers' Year 2000 web-sites.  If a supplier is determined to entail a 
"high risk" of non-year 2000 readiness, the Company will develop 
contingency and alternate sourcing plans to minimize the Year 2000 risk.  

As described in the Company's discussion of most reasonably likely worst 
case scenarios, the Company is particularly concerned about energy and 
transportation suppliers.  Many of these suppliers are unwilling to provide 
assurances that they will be "year 2000 ready".

Unique issues related to the readiness of the Company's major businesses is 
discussed in more detail below.

                               Year 2000 Costs

Motorola estimates that the expected total aggregate costs for its Year 
2000 activities from 1997 through 2000 will be in the range of $290 million 
$340 million.  Approximately $150 million of total estimated future costs 
relate to internal resources.  External costs incurred through September 
26, 1998 were approximately $70 million.  These costs do not include 
estimates for potential litigation.  The Company does not believe that the 
incremental costs of addressing Year 2000 issues will have a material 
adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, 
liquidity and capital resources.

The Company reviews and updates data for costs incurred and forecasted 
costs each quarter.  Historically most businesses within the Company did 
not estimate internal costs (salaries, fringe benefits, travel, etc.) in 
becoming Year 2000 Ready.  All estimated future costs include internal 
costs.  As the Company continues to assess the last phases of the Year 2000 
Program, estimated costs may change.

These costs are based on management's estimates, which were determined 
based on assumptions of future events, some within the Company's control, 
but many outside the Company's control.  There can be no guarantee that 
these estimates will be correct, and if actual costs increased by a 
sizeable amount, the Company's actual results could be materially adversely 
impacted.

            Most Reasonably Likely Worst Case Scenarios for the Company
                       and Company Contingency Plans

The Company has and will continue to devote substantial resources to 
address its Year 2000 issues.  However, there can be no assurances that the 
Company's products do not contain undetected Year 2000 problems.  Further, 
there can be no assurances that the Company's assessment of suppliers and 
vendors will be accurate.  In addition, many commentators believe that 
there will be a significant amount of litigation arising out of "year 2000 
readiness" issues.  Because of the unprecedented nature of this litigation, 
it is impossible for the Company to predict the impact of such litigation 
although it could be significant to the Company.  In addition to the unique 
reasonably likely worst case scenarios described by the specific 
businesses, the Company believes its scenarios include: (i) corruption of 
data contained in the Company's internal information systems; (ii) hardware 
failures; (iii) the failure of infrastructure services provided by 
government agencies and other third-party suppliers (including energy, 
water, and transport); and (iv) health, environmental and safety issues 
relating to its facilities.  If any of these were to occur, the Company' 
operations could be interrupted, in some cases for a sustained period of 
time.  These interruptions could be more severe in countries outside the 
U.S. where the Company does sizeable business. 

The Company and its businesses are preparing contingency plans to deal with 
these worst case scenarios.  The Company has operations around the world 
and is considering shifting operations to different facilities if there 
were interruptions to operations in particular areas, countries or regions.

Cellular Subscriber Sector (CSS)

CSS, which designs and develops, manufactures and sells Motorola cellular 
telephones, has completed its Year 2000 product review.  All Motorola cellular 
telephones currently on the market either: (i) do not contain internal date 
storage, processing, or display capabilities and thus are not impacted by the 
Year 2000 date change; or (ii) contain internal date storage, processing, or 
display capabilities that are Year 2000 Ready.  In addition, CSS has systems in 
place to ensure that future cellular telephones sold by the Company will be Year
2000 Ready.  

Cellular Infrastructure Group (CIG)

CIG designs and develops, manufactures, installs and services wireless 
infrastructure equipment for cellular and personal communications networks.  
Certain CIG products operate with date sensitivity.  CIG is developing 
appropriate hardware modifications and new versions of software to address 
the Year 2000 issue.  CIG expects to make upgrades (i.e., hardware 
modifications and/or new software versions, as appropriate) available to 
its operator customers by December 31, 1998.  As CIG sells systems 
throughout the world, trained technicians will be required in many 
countries to install these upgrades.  CIG is also developing "work-arounds" 
for certain systems that will not be upgraded.  A work-around gives the 
operator necessary procedures to keep the system operating on and after 
January 1, 2000.  If a customer does not follow the recommended procedures, 
in all probability, the system would not recognize certain dates properly, 
which would affect the accuracy of the billing information.  CIG has 
concluded that some of its systems are too old to either upgrade or provide 
a work-around for Year 2000 problems.  CIG has notified (or made reasonable 
efforts to notify) customers of those systems that conversions or work-
arounds will not be available, and is working with those customers to 
provide alternate solutions.

Because outside vendors supply certain components and some portion of the 
software for CIG-supplied wireless systems, an intensive plan to inventory 
and have all such components and software tested was developed.  The plan 
includes conversion and deployment, where necessary, consistent with the 
above timetable.  Further, vendors whose parts are not Year 2000 compliant 
will be replaced. 

Management believes that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
related to the Year 2000 problem is the inability of CIG to upgrade all 
systems before January 1, 2000 due to the significant number of customer 
locations to be visited.  As a result, certain data routinely available 
from those systems could be inaccurate on and after January 1, 2000 (i.e., 
until upgraded).  As a result, CIG could potentially be sued as the 
supplier of those systems, although its efforts to identify its customers 
and provide software solutions should reduce these risks.

Land Mobile Products Sector (LMPS)

LMPS manufactures and sells two-way voice and data products and systems for 
a variety of worldwide applications.  Principal customers for two-way 
products include public safety agencies (police, fire, etc.), utilities, 
diverse industrial companies, transportation companies and companies in 
various other industries.  LMPS is also selling products in an emerging 
consumer two-way radio market.  This segment also sells iDEN(Registered) 
products around the world.

All products currently shipping from LMPS factories are "year 2000 ready" 
with a few minor exceptions, and all customers buying exceptions are fully 
informed of what they are purchasing before shipments are made.  Some older 
products operate with date sensitivity.  These include legacy Special 
Products (SP's), "911 Systems" and the iDEN system.  The iDEN system is 
expected to be Year 2000 Ready when a new system release is made in May 
1999.  The customers involved with this product line are being informed of 
these product developments.  LMPS has notified customers of certain of its 
"911 Systems" in the U.S. that their systems are not fully Year 2000 Ready.  
New software for these systems and the code is expected to be available in 
January 1999 and installations of such software will continue through the 
end the third quarter of 1999.  SP's are communication systems designed 
specifically for particular customers.  LMPS cannot assess whether those 
systems are Year 2000 Ready because the systems must be tested where they 
are located.  LMPS is contacting the customer and developing solutions, 
usually software updates, to make these systems Year 2000 Ready.  
 
Management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
involving its business is the failure of a public safety system on January 
1, 2000 (or thereafter).  As a result, LMPS could potentially be sued as 
the supplier of those systems.  Management believes that its efforts to 
identify the customers of these systems and provide software solutions 
should reduce these risks.

Messaging, Information and Media Sector (MIMS)

MIMS, through its Messaging Systems Products Group (MSPG), manufactures and 
sells paging and wireless subscriber products and paging and wireless data 
infrastructure equipment.  MIMS also manufactures and sells modems, data 
communication devices and equipment that enables voice video and high-speed 
data communications over cable networks.

MSPG products currently being shipped are Year 2000 Ready with the 
exception of certain infrastructure products being sold in Asian markets.  
MSPG has identified such infrastructure products to purchasers and has a 
plan to make such products Year 2000 Ready.  MSPG has posted on its web-
site and sent in printed form to inquiring customers lists of all its 
products that have no internal calendars or clocks and are not materially 
impacted by the Year 2000, all products that have such clocks and calendars 
and are Year 2000 Ready, and a third group of products that have reached 
the end of their supported life and, therefore, have not been tested for 
Year 2000 Readiness. Certain infrastructure products that require an 
upgrade to be Year 2000 Ready have been listed on a web-site.  Customers 
have been encouraged to contact MSPG to obtain upgrades to achieve Year 
2000 Readiness for certain products. 

MSPG's management believes the worst case scenario is that a mission 
critical page may not be sent or received as a result of lack of Year 2000 
Readiness of messaging software, infrastructure or pagers and the Company 
is sued.  Management believes that its efforts at communicating to MSPG 
customers the potential for such failures will reduce the likelihood of 
occurrence.

All data communications equipment and modems sold by MIMS are Year 2000 
ready.  Older data communications and modems products can be made Year 2000 
ready by currently available software upgrades.  Management does not 
believe that any of its critical suppliers are at risk because of Year 2000 
readiness issues based on assurances from those suppliers.

Space and Systems Technology Group (SSTG)

SSTG is engaged in the design, development and production of advanced 
electronic communications systems and products.  This discussion refers to 
SSTG, other than its satellite business.  SSTG has conducted a 
comprehensive review of all products and systems sold under contracts and 
purchase orders executed since January 1, 1990.  Through that process it 
has been determined that relatively few of SSTG's products or systems 
contain date-sensitive functions that are expected to be adversely affected 
by the Year 2000 issue.  SSTG is addressing each of the few products or 
systems with problems in one of four ways.  First, SSTG has developed, or 
is in the process of developing, fixes for some of the Year 2000 problems 
discovered and is offering those fixes to its customers.  Second, in some 
cases, SSTG is working directly with customers who have funded specific 
testing and corrective actions to products or systems they purchased or are 
purchasing under contracts with SSTG.  Some of these customer-funded fixes 
are not expected to be complete until the middle of 1999.  Third, "work-
arounds" have been communicated to certain customers when a more elaborate 
fix is not necessary for them to keep their products or systems operating 
on and after January 1, 2000.  Finally, SSTG has concluded that some of its 
products and systems are too old to either fix or provide a work-around for 
Year 2000 problems.  SSTG has notified (or made reasonable efforts to 
notify) customers of those products or systems that fixes or work-arounds 
will not be available. 

SSTG believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario related to the 
Year 2000 problem is the failure of a few products or systems to operate 
for a short period of time after January 1, 2000.  As a result, SSTG may be 
sued as a manufacturer of products or systems that failed.  Many of these 
products or systems were sold to government customers.  Management believes 
it generally does not have legal liability to these customers.

The satellite business designs, develops, manufacturers, integrates, 
deploys, operates and maintains space-based telecommunication systems and 
related ground system components.  At present, the business consists of one 
operating system known as the Iridium System.  This system contains date-
sensitive functions.  The satellite business is still actively involved in 
the assessment stage of the Year 2000 issue, and is not yet prepared to 
comment on the Year 2000 readiness of the system.  The assessment effort is 
expected to be completed by December 31, 1998.  The satellite business 
expects to make any necessary hardware and/or software upgrades available 
to customers by July 1, 1999.  The satellite business anticipates that it 
would need to supply technicians to install any such upgrades, and does not 
anticipate any difficulty in meeting any potential installation needs. The 
satellite business is keeping its customers aware of the status of its 
assessment efforts.

Semiconductor Products Sector (SPS)

SPS manufactures various types of semiconductors.  SPS has reviewed these 
semiconductors to determine if they are Year 2000 Ready.  Most of the SPS 
products do not have Year 2000 Readiness issues because they do not contain 
date-sensitive functions.  SPS has identified approximately 70 
semiconductors that contain a real-time clock-function that utilize a two-
digit date field to track "years".  SPS is making information on these real 
time clocks available to its customers, including the posting of 
information on the Motorola Year 2000 web-site.  In addition, it is 
possible that a semiconductor may experience "year 2000 readiness" issues 
due to the manner in which a customer has programmed the semiconductor or 
due to the manner in which the semiconductor is incorporated into a 
customer system or product.  SPS is also making information available to 
its customers on this potential Year 2000 readiness issue.

Literature on the Year 2000 problem references what is referred to as the 
"embedded chip" Year 2000 problem or the "embedded systems" Year 2000 
problem.  (The word "chip" is a short-hand reference for a semiconductor 
product.)  Many common electronic products contain "chips" or "systems" 
that are incorporated or "embedded" into the product.  If these "chips" or 
"systems" experience Year 2000 Readiness issues, due to the manner in which 
they are programmed, the product may malfunction.  Because this programming 
is customer defined, the extent to which the malfunctioning of these 
products may occur due to a Year 2000 Readiness issue with an SPS 
semiconductor is unknown at this time.

Automotive, Component, Computer and Energy Sector (ACCES)

ACCES manufactures and sells automotive and industrial electronics; energy 
storage products and systems; ceramic and quartz electronic components; 
electronic fluorescent ballasts; and multifunction embedded board and 
system products.  ACCES continues to assess the "year 2000 readiness" of 
its products manufactured within the last eight years and its manufacturing 
facilities.  Other than embedded board and system products, and Global 
Positioning System receivers, these products do not contain date-sensitive 
functions, excluding customer provided software incorporated in such 
products, for which ACCES' does not have sufficient information in most 
cases to conduct an evaluation of whether such functions are included.  
Motorola has advised its customers that responsibility for evaluating this 
software is that of the customer.

In the case of Global Positioning System receivers, engineering analysis is 
complete, and the products are Year 2000 Ready.  The operation of such 
receivers are dependent on the proper functioning of the Global Positioning 
satellite system maintained and operated by the Federal government, and is 
outside of the control of Motorola.  There is a second date related issue 
for these products, relating to the "1024 weeks" method of date calculation 
used in the satellites, which will potentially impact the GPS in August 
1999.  While the products are believed compliant, full evaluation of the 
products for this date rollover phenomenon remains underway at this time.

In the case of embedded boards, systems and software products that are 
manufactured by the Motorola Computer Group (MCG), some of the older 
products have failed to meet Motorola's definition of Year 2000 Ready.  In 
many of these cases, MCG has made fixes available to its customers to cure 
the problem.  Although it is difficult to measure any potential liability 
from non-Year 2000 Ready products, MCG believes the risks are relatively 
small based on the following.  Since October 1, 1998, MCG has ceased 
shipping any products that are not Year 2000 Ready without a waiver from 
the customer.  Fixes have been made available for products that may remain 
under warranty after 1999.  There is some risk that customers could claim 
damages for products which are outside the warranty period, but MCG 
believes the risk of liability is low since many of these products have 
been updated over the years with products that are Year 2000 Ready.  The 
other potential liability lies in the fact that in many cases it is not 
known in what applications the products are being used.  There is always 
the possibility that some products have been incorporated into critical use 
applications, but all of the known cases are being evaluated.

MCG has deferred a number of small projects until the Year 2000 Assessment 
Program is complete.  While it intends to reinstate these projects in 1999, 
the delay could impact the efficiencies at MCG that the projects were 
intended to address. 

The Company has made forward-looking statements regarding its Year 2000 
Program.  Those statements include: the Company's expectations about when 
it will be "year 2000 ready"; the Company's expectations about the impact 
of the Year 2000 problem on its ability to continue to operate on and after 
January 1, 2000; the readiness of its suppliers; the costs associated with 
the Year 2000 Program; and worst case scenarios.  The Company has described 
many of the risks associated with those forward-looking statements above.  
However, the Company wishes to caution the reader that there are many 
factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those 
stated in the forward-looking statements.  This is especially the case 
because many aspects of its Year 2000 Program are outside its control such 
as the performance of many thousands of third-party suppliers and of 
customers and end users.  As a global company it operates it many different 
countries, some of which may not be addressing the Year 2000 problem to the 
same extent as in the United States.  As a result, there may be unforeseen 
problems in different parts of the world.  All of these factors make it 
impossible for the Company to ensure that it will be able to resolve all 
year 2000 problems in a timely manner to avoid materially adversely 
affecting its operations or business or exposing the Company to third-party 
liability.

Euro Conversion:

On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European 
Union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their 
existing national currencies and the euro.  The participating countries 
have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date.  
Until January 1, 2002, either the euro or a participating country's present 
currency (a "national currency") will be accepted as legal currency.  On 
January 1, 2002, euro-denominated bills and coins will be issued and 
national currencies will be withdrawn from circulation.

The Company has formed a task force to assess the potential impact to the 
Company that may result from the euro conversion.  In addition to tax and 
accounting considerations, the Company is assessing the potential impact 
from the euro conversion in a number of areas, including the following: (1) 
the technical challenges to adapt information technology and other systems 
to accommodate euro-denominated transactions; (2) the competitive impact of 
cross-border price transparency, which may make it more difficult for 
businesses to charge different prices for the same products on a country-
by-country basis; (3) the impact on currency exchange costs and currency 
exchange rate risk; and (4) the impact on existing contracts.

Since the task force is still in its assessment phase, the Company cannot 
yet predict the anticipated impact of the euro conversion on the Company.

Outlook:

The Company believes that the manufacturing consolidation, cost reduction 
and restructuring programs initiated in the second quarter, which generated 
an estimated $140 million in savings during the third quarter, are on track 
to achieve the goal of an annualized savings rate of at least $750 million 
by mid-1999.  The Company also expects to benefit from its broadening 
portfolio of digital cellular phones, new efficiencies resulting from the 
Communications Enterprise and its focus on integrated customer solutions 
and the refocusing of the Company's semiconductor business.

The Company continues to be affected by the weak economic conditions in 
Asia and the slowing of global economic growth.  If these adverse economic 
conditions persist or deteriorate, Motorola's financial performance may be 
negatively impacted.

Business Risks:

Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking and involve 
risks and uncertainties.  These include the statements in "Outlook" and 
statements about Motorola's manufacturing consolidation, cost reduction and 
restructuring programs and the impact of such programs, Iridium's financing 
needs, Motorola's guarantee of Iridium bank financing, deployment and 
commercialization of Iridium (Registered) products and services, the 
Company's 1998 fixed asset expenditures, the impact of Year 2000 issues, 
and the impact of euro conversion issues.  Motorola wishes to caution the 
reader that the factors below and those in Motorola's 1998 Proxy Statement 
on pages F-8 and F-9 and in its other SEC filings could cause Motorola's 
results to differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking 
statements.  These factors include: (i) the ability of Motorola to 
implement manufacturing consolidations, cost reductions and restructuring 
actions in a timely manner and the success of those efforts; (ii) the 
ability of the Company to integrate its businesses to reduce costs and 
increase efficiencies; (iii) unanticipated impact of the manufacturing 
consolidation, cost reduction and restructuring programs on productivity 
and the ability of the company to retain, and where necessary recruit, 
employees; (iv) the timing of the end of the worldwide semiconductor 
industry recession; (v) the success of ongoing efforts to stabilize 
economic conditions in Asia and other emerging markets; (vi) pricing 
pressures and demand for the company's products, particularly semiconductor 
and messaging products, especially in light of the current economic 
conditions in Asia and other emerging markets; (vii) the potential that the 
impact of weakened currencies in Southeast Asia could further impact 
countries where Motorola does a sizable amount of business, including China 
and Japan; (viii) the potential that deteriorating economic conditions in 
Japan could continue or worsen; (ix) the ability of Motorola's cellular 
businesses to continue to transition to digital products and gain market 
share; (x) product and technology development and commercialization risks, 
including for newer digital products, Iridium(Registered) satellite 
deployment and software development and Iridium products and services; (xi) 
the uncertainty of steady growth in emerging markets; (xii) the success of 
the Iridium project and the impact on Motorola's financial 
performance;(xiii) unanticipated changes in demand for products; (xiv) 
continued weak demand for paging products in North America and China; (xv) 
unanticipated impact of Year 2000 issues, particularly the failure of 
products of major suppliers to function properly in the Year 2000; and 
(xvi) unanticipated impact of euro conversion issues.

                          Part II - Other Information

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings.

Motorola has been a defendant in several cases arising out of its 
manufacture and sale of portable cellular telephones.  On October 6, 1998, 
the Illinois Supreme Court denied plaintiff's petition for leave to appeal 
in Schiffner v. Motorola, a purported class action by purchasers of 
portable cellular phones alleging economic losses, and thereby left 
standing the lower court judgment in Motorola's favor.

On October 16, 1998, Pennsylvania Bancshares, Inc. et al. v. Motorola, 
Inc., et al., a purported class action filed on October 10, 1995 in the 
Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, was dismissed with 
prejudice as to all claims for monetary relief and without prejudice as to 
all claims for equitable relief.  Plaintiffs alleged that Motorola 
systematically engages in deceptive trade practices, including without 
limitation, intentionally misrepresenting the quality of certain types of 
cellular telephones.

See Item 3 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 
31, 1997 and Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Form 10-Q for the periods 
ended March 28, 1998 and June 27, 1998 for additional disclosures regarding 
pending matters.

In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial 
position, liquidity or results of operations of Motorola.

Item 2 - Changes in Securities.

Adoption of New Preferred Share Purchase Rights Agreement

On November 5, 1998, the Company announced that its Board of Directors 
adopted a new Preferred Share Purchase Rights Agreement to replace the 
existing plan that expired November 20, 1998.  Under the plan, rights will 
attach to existing shares of common stock, $3 par value, of the Company at 
the rate of one right for each share of common stock held by shareholders 
of record November 20, 1998.  The rights will expire in November 2008.

The plan is designed to help ensure that all Motorola shareholders receive 
fair treatment in the event of an unsolicited attempt to gain control of 
the Company.  The new plan has not been adopted in response to any specific 
takeover threat, and the Board of Directors is unaware of any effort by a 
third party to acquire control of the Company.

Each right will entitle a shareholder to buy, under certain circumstances, 
one unit of a share of preferred stock for $200.  The rights generally will 
be exercisable only if a person or group acquires 10 percent or more of the 
Company's common stock or begins a tender or exchange offer for 10 percent 
or more of the Company's common stock.  If a person acquires beneficial 
ownership of 10% or more of the Company's common stock, all holders of 
rights other than the acquiring person, will be entitled to purchase the 
Company's common stock (or, in certain cases, common equivalent shares) at 
a 50% discount.  Motorola may redeem the new rights at a price of one cent 
per right.  A summary of the new rights plan will be mailed to 
shareholders.

Item 3 - Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
Not applicable.

Item 4 - Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
Not applicable.

Item 5 - Other Information.

Redemption of $368 million of LYONs due 2013

On September 28, 1998, the Company redeemed $368 million principal amount 
at maturity of its outstanding LYONs due 2013 at the election of the 
holders thereof.  The Company made a total payment of $263 million to 
redeem these LYONs.  The proceeds used for this redemption were obtained 
entirely from the issuance of commercial paper.  As of October 15, 1998, 
approximately $110 million principal amount at maturity of the Company's 
LYONs due 2013 remained outstanding.

Sale of 5.80% Notes due October 15, 2008

On October 20, 1998, the Company sold an aggregate face principal amount at 
maturity of $325 million of 5.80% Notes due October 15, 2008.  The net 
proceeds to the Company from the issuance and sale of the Notes were $322 
million.  The Company intends to use the proceeds to reduce short-term 
indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

                             MOTOROLA, INC.
                   5.80 percent Note Due October 15, 2008


     Unless and until this certificate is exchanged in whole or in part for 
Notes in definitive registered form, this Note may not be transferred 
except as a whole by The Depository Trust Company, a New York corporation 
("DTC" or the "Depositary"), to its nominee or by its nominee to DTC or 
another nominee of DTC or by DTC or any such nominee to a successor 
depository or a nominee of such successor depository.  Any certificate 
issued in exchange herefor shall be registered in the name of Cede & Co. or 
in such other name as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC 
(and any payment in respect hereof shall be made to Cede & Co. or to such 
other entity as is requested by an authorized representative of DTC).

     MOTOROLA, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Issuer", which term 
includes any successor corporation under the Senior Indenture hereafter 
referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co. or 
registered assigns, at the office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of 
Manhattan, The City of New York, or at such other locations as the Issuer 
may from time to time designate, the principal sum of THREE HUNDRED TWENTY-
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS on October 15, 2008, in such coin or currency of the 
United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender 
for the payment of public and private debts, and to pay interest, semi-
annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 
1999, on the original principal amount hereof at said office or agency, in 
like coin or currency, at the rate per annum specified in the title of this

unless no interest has been paid on the Notes (as defined below) or duly 
provided for, in which case from October 20, 1998, until payment of the 
principal amount hereof has been made or duly provided for; provided, that 
payment of interest may be made at the option of the Issuer by check mailed 
by first class mail to the address of the person entitled thereto as such 
address shall appear on the Security register.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if the date hereof is after April 1 or October 1 as the case may 
be, and before the following April 15 or October 15, this Note shall bear 
interest from such April 15 or October 15; provided, that if the Issuer 
shall default in the payment of interest due on such April 15 or October 
15, then this Note shall bear interest from the next preceding April 15 or 
October 15, to which interest has been paid or duly provided for or, if no 
interest has been paid on the Notes or duly provided, for, from October 20, 
1998.  The interest so payable on any April 15 or October 15, will, subject 
to certain exceptions provided in the Senior Indenture referred to on the 
reverse hereof, be paid to the person in whose name this Note (or one or 
more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the April 
1 or October 1 (whether or not a Business Day), as the case may be, next

                                MOTOROLA, INC.
                    5.80 percent Note due October 15, 2008

     This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes, 
bonds or other evidences of indebtedness of the Issuer (hereinafter called 
the "Securities") of the series hereinafter specified, all issued or to be 
issued under and pursuant to a Senior Indenture dated as of May 1, 1995 
(herein called the "Senior Indenture"), duly executed and delivered by the 
Issuer to Harris Trust and Savings Bank, as Trustee (herein called the 
"Trustee"), to which Senior Indenture and all indentures supplemental 
thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, 
limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the 
Trustee, the Issuer and the Holders of the Securities.  The Securities may 
be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in 
various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may 
bear interest (if any) at different rates, may be subject to different 
redemption provisions (if any) and may otherwise vary as provided in the 
Senior Indenture.  This Note is one of a series designated as the 5.80% 
Notes due October 15, 2008 (the "Notes") of the Issuer, limited in 
aggregate principal amount at maturity to $325,000,000.

     Except as otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, this Note will 
be issued in global form only registered in the name of the Depositary or 
its nominee.  This Note will not be issued in definitive form, except as 
otherwise provided in the Senior Indenture, and ownership of this Note 
shall be maintained in book-entry form by the Depositary for the accounts 
of participating organizations of the Depositary.

     In case an Event of Default with respect to the Notes shall have 
occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon 
such declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the 
effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Senior Indenture.

     The Senior Indenture contains provisions permitting the Issuer and the 
Trustee, with the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in 
aggregate principal amount of the Securities of all series issued under 
such Senior Indenture then Outstanding and affected, voting as one class, 
to add any provisions to, or change in any manner or eliminate any of the 
provisions of, such Senior Indenture or modify in any manner the rights of 
the Holders of the Securities of each series so affected; provided that the 
Issuer and the Trustee may not, without the consent of the Holder of each 
Security affected thereby, (i) extend the stated maturity of the principal 
of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof or reduce the rate 
or extend the time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amount 
payable on redemption thereof or change the currency in which the principal 
thereof (including any amount in respect of original issue discount), 
premium, if any, or interest thereon is payable or reduce the amount of any 
original issue discount security payable upon acceleration or provable in 
bankruptcy or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any 
payment on any Security when due or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage in 
principal amount of Securities of any series issued under such Senior 
Indenture, the consent of the Holders of which is required for any such 
modification.  It is also provided in the Senior Indenture that, with 
respect to certain defaults or Events of Default regarding the Securities 
of any series, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of such 
Securities, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount 
Outstanding of the Securities of such series (or, in the case of certain 
defaults or Events of Default, all or certain series of the Securities) may 
on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of such series (or all or 
certain series of the Securities, as the case may be) waive any such past 
default or Event of Default and its consequences.  The preceding sentence 
shall not, however, apply to a default in the payment of the principal or 
interest on any of the Securities.  Any such consent or waiver by the 
Holder of this Note (unless revoked as provided in the Senior Indenture) 
shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future 
Holders and owners of this Note and any Notes which may be issued in 
exchange or substitution hereof or on registration of transfer hereof, 
irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this Note 
or such other Notes.

     No reference herein to the Senior Indenture and no provision of this 
Note or of the Senior Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the 
Issuer, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and 
interest on this Note in the manner, at the respective times, at the rate 
and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

     The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in 
denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof at the office or 
agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, or 
at such other locations as the issuer may from time to time designate, and 
in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Senior 
Indenture, but without the payment of any service charge, Notes may be 
exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of other 
authorized denominations.

     The Notes are not redeemable and are not entitled to any sinking fund.

     Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Note at the 
office or agency of the Issuer in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New 
York, or at such other locations as the Issuer may from time to time 
designate, a new Note or Notes of authorized denominations for an equal 
aggregate principal amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange 
therefor, subject to the limitations provided in the Senior Indenture, 
without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in 
connection therewith.

     The Issuer, the Trustee and any authorized agent of the Issuer or the 
Trustee may deem and treat the registered Holder hereof as the absolute 
owner of this Note (whether or not this Note shall be overdue and 
notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon), for the 
purpose of receiving payment of, or on account of, the principal hereof and 
subject to the provisions on the face hereof, interest hereon, and for all 
other purposes, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any authorized agent 
of the Issuer or the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the 
contrary.

     No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the 
Issuer in the Senior Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in 
any Note, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented 
thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or 
director, as such, of the Issuer or of any successor corporation, either 
directly or through the Issuer or any successor corporation, under any rule 
of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any 
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such 
liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and 
as part of the consideration or the issue hereof.

     This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in 
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

     Terms used herein which are defined in the Senior Indenture shall have 
the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Senior Indenture.
