1.  Basis of Presentation

On January 5, 2000, Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") completed its previously
announced merger with General Instrument Corporation ("General Instrument")
by exchanging 301 million shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1
common stock split described below) of its common stock for all of the
common stock of General Instrument.  Each share of General Instrument was
exchanged for 1.725 shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 common
stock split described below) of Motorola's common stock.  Motorola has
accounted for the merger as a pooling-of-interests and accordingly, all
prior period consolidated financial statements of Motorola have been
restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash
flows of General Instrument.  The effects of conforming General
Instrument's accounting policies to those of Motorola were not material.

For the three-month period ended July 3, 1999, net sales for Motorola and
General Instrument were $7.5 billion and $527 million, respectively.  Net
earnings for Motorola and General Instrument were $206 million and $49
million, respectively.  For the six-month period ended July 3, 1999, net
sales for Motorola and General Instrument were $14.7 billion and $1.0
billion, respectively.  Net earnings for Motorola and General Instrument
were $377 million and $77 million, respectively.  Results of operations for
the three-month and six-month periods ended July 1, 2000, already reflect
the pooling-of-interests.  From this point onward, all references to
Motorola, Inc. or the Company reflect the pooling-of-interests.

On February 29, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors declared a 3-for-1
common stock split in the form of a 200% stock dividend, contingent upon
stockholder approval of an increase in the authorized shares of the
Company's common stock from 1.4 billion to 4.2 billion.  At their Annual
Meeting on May 1, 2000, the Company's stockholders approved this increase
in authorized shares of common stock.  Accordingly, on June 1, 2000, the
Company distributed 1.4 billion common shares to common stockholders of
record on May 15, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend.  The par value of
the common stock remained at $3 per share.

The effect of the stock split has been recognized retroactively in the
stockholders' equity accounts as of December 31, 1999, and in all share and
per share data in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements and the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.
The stockholders' equity accounts have been restated to reflect the
reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase in
issued common shares from additional paid-in capital and retained earnings
to common stock.

The condensed consolidated financial statements as of July 1, 2000 and for
the three-month and six-month periods ended July 1, 2000 and July 3, 1999,
include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present
fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of
July 1, 2000 and for all periods presented.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been condensed or omitted.  These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto incorporated by reference in the
Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, as supplemented
by Form 8-K/As filed on March 24, 2000 and on June 2, 2000.  The results of
operations for the three-month and six-month periods ended July 1, 2000 are
not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the
full year.  Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements and
related notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the three-month
period ended July 1, 2000, the assumed conversion of the zero coupon notes
due 2009 and approximately 59.8 million stock options with exercise prices
greater than the average market price of the underlying common stock were
excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the six-month
period ended July 1, 2000, approximately 56.5 million stock options with
exercise prices greater than the average market price of the underlying
common stock were excluded because their inclusion would have been
antidilutive.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", requires the carrying
value of available for sale securities to be adjusted to fair value.  As
such, the Company recorded an increase to investments, deferred income
taxes and stockholders' equity of $2.3 billion, $808 million and $1.5
billion, respectively, as of July 1, 2000; and an increase to investments,
deferred income taxes and stockholders' equity of $5.5 billion, $2.2
billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 1999.

At December 31, 1999, the Company's investment in Broadcom Corporation
carried certain restrictions related to the sale of the securities.  Such
restrictions did not lapse until April 2000.  Accordingly, at December 31,
1999, the Company carried this investment at its cost of $22 million and
did not record a fair value adjustment at that time.

segments for financial reporting purposes.  The Broadband Communications
Segment combines the operations of General Instrument Corporation with the
existing cable modem and telephony business of the Company's Internet and
Networking Group, which is part of the Other Products Segment.  The
Integrated Electronic Systems Sector, which has been included in the Other
Products Segment, is now reported as a separate segment.  Historical
segment data has been restated to reflect these changes.

At July 1, 2000, the Company owned, directly and indirectly, approximately
18% of the equity interests in Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries
(Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries are collectively referred to as
"Iridium") and a significant portion of a series of Iridium bonds.  Since
August 1999, Iridium has operated as debtors-in-possession under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Code.  On March 17, 2000, Iridium began the
process of winding down and liquidating its operations because no qualified
bid to purchase the Iridium satellites was timely received.  At the same
time, the Company began the process of finalizing a plan for the
decommissioning of the Iridium constellation and continued with the process
of shutting down its Iridium-related operations.

As part of the liquidation process, Iridium has been authorized by the New
York bankruptcy court to implement a letter of intent with a potential
purchaser of its assets and to adopt a procedure to solicit and evaluate
other bids for its assets.  In connection with this process, Iridium has
filed a motion requesting the bankruptcy court to stay the provisions of an
earlier order authorizing Motorola to implement the decommissioning of the
Iridium satellites.  A hearing has been scheduled for July 31, 2000 for the
bankruptcy court to hear this motion.

At December 31, 1999 the Company had $1.8 billion of reserves related to
the Iridium program.  There were no charges recorded in the second quarter
of 2000 related to the Iridium program.  During the second quarter of 1999,
the Company recorded $162 million of charges related to the Iridium
program.  Included in this charge was a $126 million special charge to
write down the value of its Iridium bonds and $36 million of other charges
to reserve for assets at risk and other potential contractual obligations.

The following table displays a rollforward by category from December 31,
1999 to July 1, 2000, of the remaining accrual balances:

                                             Q1 2000  Q2 2000

Totals                            $ 1,798    $(1,284)  $  (63)    $  451


Through July 1, 2000 the Company utilized $1.3 billion of reserves
including $661 million for accounts receivable write-offs and $686 million
primarily for inventory and other asset write-offs.  The total amount used
through July 1, 2000 of $1.3 billion reflects approximately $112 million in
cash payments and $1.2 billion in write-offs.  The cash payments were
primarily for costs associated with the wind-down of Iridium operations and
Iridium gateway debt guarantees.  Of the remaining $451 million accrual
balance as of July 1, 2000, the Company expects to make approximately $362
million in cash payments and $89 million in write-offs.  There were no
reserves used in the first or second quarters of 1999.

The reserve related to the Iridium program as of July 1, 2000 was $451
million, of which $322 million was included in accrued liabilities, $54
million was included as a contra asset, in inventories, $50 million was
included as a contra asset, in property, plant and equipment, and $25
million was included as a contra asset, in other assets.  The development
and commercialization reserve as of December 31, 1999 was $1.8 billion, of
which $869 million was included in accrued liabilities, $734 million was
included as a contra asset, in inventories, $79 million was included as a
contra asset, in property, plant and equipment, $72 million was included as
a contra asset, in other assets, $39 million was included in other
liabilities, $4 million was included in accounts payable, and $1 million
was included as a contra asset, in accounts receivable, in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets.  These reserves are believed by management to
be sufficient to cover the Company's Iridium exposures.  These reserves do
not include additional special charges that may arise as a result of
litigation related to the Iridium project.

The Company had several contracts with Iridium, primarily for the operation
and maintenance of the global personal communications system.  The Company
stopped recognizing revenue on the operations and maintenance contract with
Iridium after the second quarter of 1999, and continued to perform its
services under that contract throughout 1999 without being paid currently,
although the Company has not waived its right to receive payment.  Although
not contractually required to do so, the Company is continuing to operate
the Iridium system without compensation while a plan to decommission the
Iridium constellation is finalized.  The Company currently expects to
continue to perform some services without compensation during the
decommissioning, although it has not waived its right to seek compensation.

The Company had agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding to provide a
guarantee of up to an additional $350 million of Iridium debt for Iridium's
use, subject to certain conditions.  Iridium requested Motorola to provide
this guarantee during the third quarter of 1999, however, Motorola believes
it was not obligated to do so.  In certain circumstances and subject to
certain conditions, $300 million of such guarantee could have been required
to be used to guarantee amounts borrowed under the Secured Credit
Agreement.  The lenders under the Secured Credit Agreement asserted that
Iridium failed to have the Company provide such guarantee as required, and
that the Company was obligated to provide them with this $300 million
guarantee.  The Company believes that it was not obligated to do so.
Iridium has also stated that it believed it was not obligated to have the
Company provide this $300 million guarantee to these lenders.  On June 9,
2000, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the agent under the Secured Credit
Agreement, filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New York County, demanding that Motorola pay this $300 million to Chase
plus interest and legal fees.  The lenders under the Secured Credit
Agreement have also demanded that the investors in Iridium comply with
their capital call requirements.  In the Company's case, this could require
an additional equity investment of $50 million.  On June 9, 2000, the Chase
Manhattan Bank also filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in the
District of Delaware demanding that Motorola and other investors in Iridium
LLC pay their capital call requirements, plus interest and legal fees.

Creditors and other stakeholders in Iridium may seek to bring various other
claims against the Company, with respect to payments previously made by
Iridium to the Company, and otherwise.  As described in "Legal
Proceedings," a number of purported class action lawsuits alleging
securities law violations have been filed naming Iridium, certain current
and former officers of Iridium, other entities and the Company as
defendants.

Other

At July 1, 2000, the Company's commitment to Nextel Communications, Inc.
for equipment financing aggregated $457 million, of which $365 million had
been utilized.

At July 1, 2000, the Company's commitment for off-balance sheet third-party
financial guarantees aggregated $772 million, of which $583 million had
been utilized.

The Company's aggregate commitment amounts represent the maximum available
and may not be completely utilized.

Disposition:
Motorola Lighting, Inc.     Q1          $110        Cash     Not Applicable

For the three-month period ended July 1, 2000, the Company recorded a total
of approximately $306 million in acquired in-process research and
development charges for the acquisitions of C-Port Corporation, Clinical
Micro Sensors, Inc., WaveMark Technologies, Inc., and the assets and
intellectual property rights of Communication Systems Technology, Inc.  For
the six-month period ended July 1, 2000, the Company recorded a total of
approximately $315 million in acquired in-process research and development
charges.  These charges were recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Company's condensed consolidated statements
of earnings.  The Company did not incur any acquired in-process research
and development charges during the three-month and six-month periods ended
July 3, 1999.

For each acquisition, the in-process research and development will have no
alternative future uses if the products are not feasible.  Historical
pricing, margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used in the
valuation of the in-process products.  The allocation of value to in-
process research and development was determined using expected future cash
flows discounted at average risk adjusted rates reflecting both
technological and market risk as well as the time value of money.

In addition to the acquired in-process research and development charges,
the Company recorded a total of approximately $414 million in goodwill and
other intangibles which are to be amortized over periods ranging from 3 to
10 years on a straight-line basis.  The goodwill and other intangibles were
recorded in other assets in the Company's condensed consolidated balance
sheets.

The acquisitions of C-Port Corporation, Clinical Micro Sensors, Inc. and
WaveMark Technologies, Inc. were accounted for under the purchase method
and accordingly, the results of operations for each acquiree have been
included in the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date
of acquisition.  The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on the
Company's financial statements were not significant.

7. Trust Originated Preferred Securities (SM)

In February 1999, Motorola Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business
trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Trust"), sold Trust
Originated Preferred Securities (SM) ("TOPrS") to the public at an
aggregate offering price of $500 million.  The Trust used the proceeds from
this sale, together with the proceeds from its sale of common stock to the
Company, to buy a series of 6.68% Deferrable Interest Junior Subordinated
Debentures due March 31, 2039 ("Subordinated Debentures") from the Company
with the same payment terms as the TOPrS.  The sole assets of the Trust are
the Subordinated Debentures.  The TOPrS are shown as "Company-obligated
mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trust holding
solely company-guaranteed debentures" in the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

The Company's obligations relating to the TOPrS include obligations to make
payments on the Subordinated Debentures and obligations under the related
Indenture, Trust Guarantee and Declaration of Trust.  Taken together, these
obligations represent a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due
under the TOPrS.

(SM) "Trust Originated Preferred Securities" and "TOPrS" are service marks
of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.



                      Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                    Management's Discussion and Analysis
              of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

On January 5, 2000, Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") completed its previously
announced merger with General Instrument Corporation ("General Instrument")
by exchanging 301 million shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1
common stock split described below) of its common stock for all of the
common stock of General Instrument.  Each share of General Instrument was
exchanged for 1.725 shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 common
stock split described below) of Motorola's common stock.  Motorola has
accounted for the merger as a pooling-of-interests and accordingly, all
prior period consolidated financial statements of Motorola have been
restated to include the results of operations, financial position and cash
flows of General Instrument.  From this point onward, all references to
Motorola, Inc. or the Company reflect the pooling-of-interests.

On February 29, 2000, the Company's Board of Directors declared a 3-for-1
common stock split in the form of a 200% stock dividend, contingent upon
stockholder approval of an increase in the authorized shares of the
Company's common stock from 1.4 billion to 4.2 billion.  At their Annual
Meeting on May 1, 2000, the Company's stockholders approved this increase
in authorized shares of common stock.  Accordingly, on June 1, 2000, the
Company distributed 1.4 billion common shares to common stockholders of
record on May 15, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend.  The par value of
the common stock remained at $3 per share.  All historical information has
been restated to reflect the stock split.

This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Company's
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations incorporated by reference in the Company's Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1999, as supplemented by Form 8-K/As filed on March
24, 2000 and on June 2, 2000.

The order information as of any particular date may not be an accurate
indicator of future results as orders are subject to revision or
cancellation to reflect changes in customer needs.

Sales were $9.3 billion in the second quarter of 2000, up 15 percent from
$8.0 billion a year earlier.  Sales growth was attributed primarily to an
increase in sales from the digital wireless telephone business resulting
from strong market acceptance and demand for the Company's new digital
products, an increase in sales of terrestrial infrastructure equipment and
an increase in sales of internet protocol network and digital network
systems.

Second-quarter 2000 earnings were $204 million, or 9 cents per share,
compared with second-quarter 1999 earnings of $255 million, or 12 cents per
share.  Net margin on sales was 2 percent in the second quarter of 2000
compared with 3 percent a year earlier.  This decrease in earnings is
primarily attributable to an increase in special items versus the year
earlier quarter.  The increase in special items is primarily from acquired
in-process research and development charges relating to acquisitions
completed during the quarter.  These charges were principally incurred by
the semiconductor business.

Manufacturing margin in the second quarter of 2000 decreased to 40 percent
from 41 percent a year ago.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 17 percent of
sales compared to 18 percent a year earlier.

Research and development expenditures increased 31 percent to $1.1 billion,
or 12 percent of sales, in the second quarter of 2000 compared to $842
million, or 10 percent of sales, a year earlier.  Over the past three
years, the Company has been increasing the percentage of its sales that is
spent on research and development.  The Company continues to believe that a
strong commitment to research and development is required to drive long-
term growth.  Research and development spending in 2000 is expected to
continue to increase at a rate higher than the rate of sales growth.

Depreciation expense in the second quarter of 2000 as a percentage of sales
decreased to 6 percent from 7 percent a year earlier.  This decline was
attributable to the increase in sales, while depreciation expense remained
fairly constant.  Depreciation expense for 2000 is expected to increase,
but at a rate below the expected rate of sales growth.

Interest expense increased versus a year ago to $54 million from $47
million due to increased commercial paper and short-term borrowings.
Interest expense for the full year of 2000 is expected to increase at a
rate greater than the expected rate of sales growth.

The tax rate for the second quarter 2000 increased to 51 percent from 31
percent a year earlier.  The increased tax rate reflects the impact of
significant non-deductible charges for acquired in-process research and
development (IPR&D) from acquisitions completed during the second quarter.
Excluding the impact of significant non-deductible charges for IPR&D, the
Company's effective income tax rate for the second quarter of 2000 was 30
percent.  There were no significant non-deductible charges in the second
quarter of 1999.  The Company currently expects the annual tax rate for
2000, excluding the impact of significant non-deductible charges, from both
prior and potential future acquisitions, to be 30 percent.  This estimate
is based on current tax law, the current estimate of earnings and the
expected distribution of income among various tax jurisdictions.

Sales were $18.0 billion in the first half of 2000, up 14 percent from
$15.8 billion a year earlier.  Sales growth was attributed primarily to an
increase in sales from the digital wireless phone business resulting from
strong market acceptance and demand for the Company's new digital products,
an increase in sales of terrestrial infrastructure equipment, and an
increase in sales of internet protocol network and digital network systems.

Earnings for the first half of 2000 were $652 million, or 29 cents per
share, compared with earnings for the first half of 1999 of $454 million,
or 21 cents per share.  Net margin on sales was 4 percent in the first half
of 2000 compared with 3 percent for the first half of 1999.  The increase
in earnings for the first half of 2000 compared to the first half of 1999
was attributed to:  (i) increased sales, (ii) higher manufacturing margins
in the semiconductor business, (iii) higher operating margins in the
network systems and broadband communications businesses, and (iv) lower
selling, general and administrative expenses.  These improvements were
partially offset by an increase in research and development expenditures,
an increase in special items, and an increase in the effective tax rate.
The main businesses contributing to this improvement in earnings were
network systems and broadband communications.

Manufacturing margin for the first half of 2000 remained constant at 41
percent compared to the first half of 1999.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 16 percent of
sales compared to 19 percent a year earlier.  This decline was primarily
attributable to higher sales.

Research and development expenditures increased 31 percent to $2.1 billion,
or 12 percent of sales, in the first half of 2000 compared to $1.6 billion,
or 10 percent of sales, a year earlier.

Depreciation expense in the first half of 2000 as a percentage of sales
decreased to 6 percent from 7 percent a year earlier.  This decline was
attributable to the increase in sales, while depreciation expense remained
fairly constant.

Interest expense increased in the first half of 2000 versus a year ago to
$101 million from $85 million due to increased commercial paper and short-
term borrowings.

The tax rate for the six months ended July 1, 2000 increased to 38 percent
from 31 percent for the six months ended July 3, 1999.  The increased tax
rate reflects the impact of significant non-deductible charges for acquired
in-process research and development (IPR&D) from acquisitions completed
during the second quarter.  Excluding the impact of significant non-
deductible charges for IPR&D, the Company's effective income tax rate for
the first half of 2000 was 30 percent.  There were no significant non-
deductible charges in the first half of 1999.

1997 Restructuring Program

During 1997, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $327 million
resulting from decisions to exit three unprofitable businesses that no
longer had long-term strategic value to the Company.  As of December 31,
1999, the business exits from the dynamic random access memory market and
from the retail analog modem business had been completed.  For the exit
from the MacOS (Registered)-compatible computer systems business, $2
million was utilized during the first six months of 2000 for contractual
and warranty payments.  The remaining $11 million accrual as of July 1,
2000, relates to contractual commitments and warranty liability and may
extend past the 2000 year end.

Segment Information

Results of the Company's major operations, which include the effect of the
sales of various businesses and net special items, for the second quarter
of 2000 compared with the second quarter of 1999 are as follows:


Personal Communications Segment

Segment sales              $3,332     $2,788        20%
Operating profit before tax  $132       $125         6%

Net special items:
  income(expense)            $ --       $ --

Operating profit excluding
  net special items          $ 132       $125        6%

Segment sales rose 20 percent to $3.3 billion, and orders declined less
than 1 percent to $3.1 billion.  Operating profits increased to $132
million from $125 million in the year earlier quarter primarily due to an
increase in sales of digital wireless telephones.

The segment's results were not impacted by net special items or sold
businesses.  Therefore, sales, orders and operating profits were unchanged
from the data shown in the table above.

In the wireless telephone business, which includes iDEN (Registered)
phones, sales increased 25 percent, orders were unchanged, and operating
profits were higher although operating margin declined versus the year ago
quarter.  Sales were up significantly in the Americas and Asia and flat in
Europe.  Orders were up significantly in the Americas, up in Asia and down
significantly in Europe.  Order growth in Europe was negatively impacted by
the Company's decision to more selectively pursue orders for lower-tier
wireless telephones and, in particular, to de-emphasize older, less
profitable models that are being discontinued.  Digital wireless telephone
sales represented 97 percent of phone sales in the quarter.

Digital phone unit sales increased by approximately 70 percent in the
second quarter versus a year ago.  Versus the year ago quarter, unit sales
for (i) Global System for Mobile (GSM) products increased by almost 65
percent; (ii) Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) products increased
approximately 30 percent; (iii) Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
products increased by almost 200 percent; and (iv) iDEN (Registered) phones
increased approximately 100 percent.  Analog wireless telephone unit sales
decreased approximately 70 percent from a year ago.  Including the very
significant decline in analog wireless telephone unit sales, total unit
sales of wireless telephones increased by approximately 40 percent from a
year ago.

The overall selling price for digital phones declined between 10-15 percent
versus a year ago.  The overall average selling price for analog phones
declined about 10 percent in the second quarter versus a year ago.  Average
selling prices can be subject to changes in product mix and regional mix.

Sales and orders for paging products were lower than a year ago due to
fewer unit sales.  Sales and orders declined significantly in all regions.


Network Systems Segment

                           Three Months Ended

Operating profit excluding
  net special items          $256       $169         51%

Segment sales rose 23 percent to $2.0 billion, and orders increased 37
percent to $2.1 billion.  Operating profits increased to $258 million from
$169 million in the year earlier quarter due to a continuing increase in
sales of terrestrial infrastructure equipment. Included in operating
profits for the three months ended July 1, 2000 is a $2 million gain from
the sale of investments.  This special item is reflected in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated
statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits increased 51 percent to $256
million, compared to $169 million a year ago due primarily to the increase
in terrestrial infrastructure equipment sales.

The segment's results were not impacted by sold businesses.  Therefore, for
ongoing businesses, sales, orders and operating profits excluding net
special items were unchanged from the data shown in the table above.

Excluding the sales of satellite communications equipment from the second
quarter of 1999, segment sales would have increased 36 percent.  By region,
sales were up very significantly in the Americas, up significantly in
Europe and Asia, and up in Japan.  Orders were up very significantly in
Asia and Japan, and up in Europe and the Americas.  Sales of iDEN
(Registered) infrastructure equipment were up very significantly versus a
year ago.  Sales of GSM and CDMA infrastructure equipment increased
significantly.  PDC sales in Japan were significantly higher, while analog
sales were almost zero.

The Company's contract with Teledesic LLC for design and construction of a
satellite communications network continues to be contingent upon
Teledesic's approval following a technical review period.  This technical
review period was originally scheduled to end on September 11, 1999, but
Teledesic has extended the period several times.  Since approval of the
contract is in the sole discretion of Teledesic, there can be no assurances
that Teledesic will provide this approval.  The technical review period is
currently scheduled to expire on September 5, 2000.  Teledesic has
indicated in its public filings that it is probable that it will not extend
this period and that it will exercise its right to terminate the agreement.

Operating profit excluding

Segment sales rose 19 percent to $1.1 billion, and orders increased 3
percent to $1.2 billion.  Operating profits increased to $108 million from
$94 million in the year earlier quarter primarily due to higher two-way
radio equipment sales in all geographic regions.  Included in operating
profits for the three months ended July 1, 2000 is a special item
consisting of a $6 million acquired in-process research and development
charge related to the acquisition of Communication Systems Technology,
Inc.'s assets and intellectual property rights.  This special item is
included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits rose to $114 million,
compared to $94 million a year ago primarily due to the increase in sales.

For ongoing businesses, sales rose 22 percent to $1.1 billion from $934
million, and orders increased 5 percent to $1.2 billion.  Operating profits
for ongoing businesses excluding net special items rose to $114 million
compared to $91 million a year ago.

Two-way radio equipment sales were higher in all regions, with very
significant growth in Europe.  Orders were higher in all regions, with
significant growth in Asia.

The Company purchased the assets and intellectual property rights of
Communication Systems Technology, Inc., a Columbia, Maryland-based
communication system provider, in April 2000.

Segment sales rose 23 percent to $768 million, and orders increased 28
percent to $900 million.  Operating profits increased to $124 million from
$103 million in the year earlier quarter due to increases in sales,
primarily in IP (Internet Protocol) Network Systems and Digital Network
Systems businesses, and from benefits resulting from the synergies achieved
through the merger with General Instrument.  Included in operating profits
for the three months ended July 1, 2000, is a special charge of $5 million
relating to merger integration costs from the General Instrument merger.
Included in operating profits for the three months ended July 3, 1999 are
net special items of $25 million.  This gain resulted primarily from the
sale of investments.  These special items are included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of
earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits rose 65 percent to $129
million, compared to $78 million a year ago primarily due to the increase
in sales and the benefits described above.

The segment's results were not impacted by sold businesses.  Therefore, for
ongoing businesses, sales, orders and operating profits excluding net
special items were unchanged from the data shown in the table above.

Sales were up very significantly in the IP Network Systems business.  They
were up significantly in the Digital Network Systems business, higher in
the Transmission Network Systems and the Satellite Broadcast Network
Systems businesses and were significantly lower in the Analog Network
Systems business.

Orders were up very significantly in the IP Network Systems business.  They
were up significantly in the Digital Network Systems and Satellite
Broadcast Network Systems businesses, and lower in both the Transmission
Network Systems and the Analog Network Systems businesses.

By region, North America accounted for approximately 80 percent of the
segment's total sales and orders.  However, order growth in international
markets grew at a higher rate compared to North American order growth.

Operating profit excluding
  net special items           $  166     $   80        108%

Segment sales increased 1 percent to $2.0 billion, and orders increased 3
percent to $2.2 billion.  Operating results decreased to a loss of $55
million from profits of $80 million in the year earlier quarter.
The decrease in operating results was entirely due to net special charges of
$221 million included in the operating loss for the three months ended July
1, 2000.  This net special charge is comprised of $220 million in acquired
in-process research and development charges related to the acquisitions of
C-Port Corporation and WaveMark Technologies, Inc., a $17 million gain from
the sale of investments, and an $18 million charge for plant consolidation
costs.  The net special items are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits rose 108 percent to $166 million
compared to $80 million a year ago primarily due to an increase in operating
margin resulting from the impact of restructuring programs undertaken over the
past few years, including the exit of low growth or unprofitable businesses,
the consolidation of manufacturing facilities and the reduction of employees.
These restructuring programs included the strategic decision to focus the
business on high-growth end markets and to emphasize systems-on-chip
solutions, providing opportunities to reap the benefits of higher gross
margins from value-added hardware, software and services.

For ongoing businesses, sales rose 27 percent to $2.0 billion from $1.6
billion, and orders increased 31 percent to $2.2 billion.  Operating
profits for ongoing businesses excluding net special items increased to
$166 million from $24 million in the year earlier quarter.  The increase in
profits for ongoing businesses excluding net special items is primarily the
result of the factors discussed above and an increase in sales driven
partially by the growth of worldwide semiconductor demand.

By region, orders were up significantly in Asia-Pacific and higher in
Europe, the Americas and Japan.  Orders, which increased in all end
markets, were up significantly in networking and computing, wireless, and
imaging and entertainment, and higher for standard embedded solutions and
transportation.

The Company completed its acquisitions of C-Port Corporation, a developer
of high-end programmable network processors for optical networks and high-
speed Internet switching and routing, and WaveMark Technologies, Inc., a
systems provider in imaging markets for web-enabled printing.

Operating profit excluding

Segment sales rose 12 percent to $678 million, and orders increased 12
percent to $704 million.  Operating profits decreased to $38 million from
$42 million in the year earlier quarter primarily due to a special charge
of $6 million resulting from plant consolidation costs.  This special item
is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the
condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits rose to $44 million,
compared to $42 million a year ago due to very significantly higher
telematics communications sales and significantly higher sales in the
computer business.  However, these increases were partially offset by flat
sales in energy systems, lower sales in automotive and industrial
electronics, and increased research and development expenses within the
telematics business.

For ongoing businesses, sales increased 19 percent to $678 million compared
to $571 million in the year earlier quarter.  Orders increased 19 percent
to $704 million.  Operating profits for ongoing businesses excluding net
special items increased 2 percent from $43 million in the year earlier
quarter.

Other Products

In the second quarter of 2000, the Company incurred a special charge of $80
million in acquired in-process research and development related to the
acquisition of Clinical Micro Sensors, Inc. (CMS).  CMS is a genomics
instrumentation company developing and manufacturing disposable DNA
biochips and electronic biochip readers.  In the second quarter of 1999,
the Company incurred a special charge of $126 million for Iridium-related
reserves.  These special items were included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of
earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

Cash and cash equivalents aggregated $3.1 billion as of July 1, 2000,
compared to $2.7 billion as of July 3, 1999.

Net cash used by operations was $932 million for the six-month period ended
July 1, 2000, as compared to $2.0 billion in cash provided by operations
for the six-month period ended July 3, 1999.  The net cash used by
operations of $932 million was primarily due to an increase in accounts
receivable in the Personal Communications and Network Systems segments and
an increase in inventory in the Personal Communications Segment.

Net cash used by investing activities was $1.9 billion for the six-month
period ended July 1, 2000, as compared to $929 million for the six-month
period ended July 3, 1999.  The increase in cash used by investing
activities for the first half of 2000 compared to the first half of 1999
was primarily due to increased capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures
for the first half of 2000 aggregated $1.7 billion, as compared to $1.0
billion for the first half of 1999.  Of these expenditures, approximately
$1.0 billion and $516 million, respectively, were spent in the
Semiconductor Products Segment.  For 2000, total capital expenditures are
expected to be $4.9 billion, of which $2.6 billion is expected to be spent
in the Semiconductor Products Segment, compared to $2.9 billion in 1999.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.6 billion for the six-
month period ended July 1, 2000, as compared to $97 million for the six-
month period ended July 3, 1999.  The increase in cash from financing
activities for the first half of 2000 compared to the first half of 1999
was primarily due to $2.4 billion in proceeds from commercial paper and
short-term borrowings to meet the increase in cash needs from operations
primarily related to working capital.  The Company's ratio of net debt to
net debt plus equity was 18.0 percent at July 1, 2000 compared to 8.2
percent at December 31, 1999.

The Company's total domestic and non-U.S. credit facilities aggregated $6.1
billion at July 1, 2000, of which $275 million was used and the remaining
$5.8 billion was available to back up outstanding commercial paper which
totaled $4.7 billion.

Purchasers of the Company's infrastructure equipment continue to require
suppliers to provide long-term financing in connection with equipment
purchases.  Financing may include all or a portion of the purchase price
and working capital.  The Company may also assist customers in obtaining
financing from banks and other sources.

At July 1, 2000, the Company's commitment to Nextel Communications, Inc.
for equipment financing aggregated $457 million, of which $365 million had
been utilized.

At July 1, 2000, the Company's commitment for off-balance sheet third-party
financial guarantees aggregated $772 million, of which $583 million had
been utilized.

The Company's aggregate commitment amounts represent the maximum available
and may not be completely utilized.

The Company believes that it can continue to access the capital markets in
2000, if necessary, on acceptable terms and conditions.  However, factors
outside of the Company's control, such as the liquidity of the capital
markets, may affect the Company's ability to access the capital markets on
favorable terms.

Return on average invested capital, based on the performance of the four
preceding quarters ending with July 1, 2000, was 6.1 percent, compared with
4.2 percent based on the performance of the four preceding quarters ending
July 3, 1999.  The Company's current ratio, weeks receivable, and inventory
turns (using the cost-of-sales calculation method) were 1.35, 8.0, and 4.6,
respectively, at July 1, 2000, compared to 1.36, 7.7, and 5.9,
respectively, at December 31, 1999.

Iridium Program

At July 1, 2000, the Company owned, directly and indirectly, approximately
18% of the equity interests in Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries
(Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries are collectively referred to as
"Iridium") and a significant portion of a series of Iridium bonds.  Since
August 1999, Iridium has operated as debtors-in-possession under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Code.  On March 17, 2000, Iridium began the
process of winding down and liquidating its operations because no qualified
bid to purchase the Iridium satellites was timely received.  At the same
time, the Company began the process of finalizing a plan for the
decommissioning of the Iridium constellation and continued with the process
of shutting down its Iridium-related operations.

As part of the liquidation process, Iridium has been authorized by the New
York bankruptcy court to implement a letter of intent with a potential
purchaser of its assets and to adopt a procedure to solicit and evaluate
other bids for its assets.  In connection with this process, Iridium has
filed a motion requesting the bankruptcy court to stay the provisions of an
earlier order authorizing Motorola to implement the decommissioning of the
Iridium satellites.  A hearing has been scheduled for July 31, 2000 for the
bankruptcy court to hear this motion.

At December 31, 1999 the Company had $1.8 billion of reserves related to
the Iridium program.  There were no charges recorded in the second quarter
of 2000 related to the Iridium program.  During the second quarter of 1999,
the Company recorded $162 million of charges related to the Iridium
program.  Included in this charge was a $126 million special charge to
write down the value of its Iridium bonds and $36 million of other charges
to reserve for assets at risk and other potential contractual obligations.

The following table displays a rollforward by category from December 31,
1999 to July 1, 2000, of the remaining accrual balances:

                                            Q1 2000   Q2 2000

Totals                        $ 1,798       $(1,284)   $  (63)    $  451



Through July 1, 2000 the Company utilized $1.3 billion of reserves
including $661 million for accounts receivable write-offs and $686 million
primarily for inventory and other asset write-offs.  The total amount used
through July 1, 2000 of $1.3 billion reflects approximately $112 million in
cash payments and $1.2 billion in write-offs.  The cash payments were
primarily for costs associated with the wind-down of Iridium operations and
Iridium gateway debt guarantees.  Of the remaining $451 million accrual
balance as of July 1, 2000, the Company expects to make approximately $362
million in cash payments and $89 million in write-offs.  There were no
reserves used in the first or second quarters of 1999.

The reserve related to the Iridium program as of July 1, 2000 was $451
million, of which $322 million was included in accrued liabilities, $54
million was included as a contra asset, in inventories, $50 million was
included as a contra asset, in property, plant and equipment, and $25
million was included as a contra asset, in other assets.  The development
and commercialization reserve as of December 31, 1999 was $1.8 billion, of
which $869 million was included in accrued liabilities, $734 million was
included as a contra asset, in inventories, $79 million was included as a
contra asset, in property, plant and equipment, $72 million was included as
a contra asset, in other assets, $39 million was included in other
liabilities, $4 million was included in accounts payable, and $1 million
was included as a contra asset, in accounts receivable, in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets.  These reserves are believed by management to
be sufficient to cover the Company's Iridium exposures.  These reserves do
not include additional special charges that may arise as a result of
litigation related to the Iridium project.

The Company had several contracts with Iridium, primarily for the operation
and maintenance of the global personal communications system.  The Company
stopped recognizing revenue on the operations and maintenance contract with
Iridium after the second quarter of 1999, and continued to perform its
services under that contract throughout 1999 without being paid currently,
although the Company has not waived its right to receive payment.  Although
not contractually required to do so, the Company is continuing to operate
the Iridium system without compensation while a plan to decommission the
Iridium constellation is finalized.  The Company currently expects to
continue to perform some services without compensation during the
decommissioning, although it has not waived its right to seek compensation.

The Company had agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding to provide a
guarantee of up to an additional $350 million of Iridium debt for Iridium's
use, subject to certain conditions.  Iridium requested Motorola to provide
this guarantee during the third quarter of 1999, however, Motorola believes
it was not obligated to do so.  In certain circumstances and subject to
certain conditions, $300 million of such guarantee could have been required
to be used to guarantee amounts borrowed under the Secured Credit
Agreement.  The lenders under the Secured Credit Agreement asserted that
Iridium failed to have the Company provide such guarantee as required, and
that the Company was obligated to provide them with this $300 million
guarantee.  The Company believes that it was not obligated to do so.
Iridium has also stated that it believed it was not obligated to have the
Company provide this $300 million guarantee to these lenders.  On June 9,
2000, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the agent under the Secured Credit
Agreement, filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
New York County, demanding that Motorola pay this $300 million to Chase
plus interest and legal fees.  The lenders under the Secured Credit
Agreement have also demanded that the investors in Iridium comply with
their capital call requirements.  In the Company's case, this could require
an additional equity investment of $50 million.  On June 9, 2000, the Chase
Manhattan Bank also filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court in the
District of Delaware demanding that Motorola and other investors in Iridium
LLC pay their capital call requirements, plus interest and legal fees.

Creditors and other stakeholders in Iridium may seek to bring various other
claims against the Company, with respect to payments previously made by
Iridium to the Company, and otherwise.  As described in "Legal
Proceedings," a number of purported class action lawsuits alleging
securities law violations have been filed naming Iridium, certain current
and former officers of Iridium, other entities and the Company as
defendants.

A discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies are detailed in
Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Risk Management

As a multinational company, the Company's transactions are denominated in a
variety of currencies.  The Company uses financial instruments to hedge,
and therefore attempts to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of
currency fluctuations on cash flows.  The Company's policy is not to
speculate in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price
fluctuation, trade in currencies for which there are no underlying
exposures, or enter into trades for any currency to intentionally increase
the underlying exposure.  Instruments used as hedges must be effective at
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be
designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.  Accordingly,
changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly correlated
with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception
of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

The Company's strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues is to offset the
gains or losses of the financial instruments against losses or gains on the
underlying operational cash flows or investments based on the operating
business units' assessment of risk.  Currently, the Company primarily
hedges firm commitments, including assets and liabilities currently on the
balance sheet.  The Company expects that it may hedge anticipated
transactions, forecasted transactions or investments in foreign
subsidiaries in the future.

Almost all of the Company's non-functional currency receivables and
payables which are denominated in major currencies that can be traded on
open markets are hedged.  The Company uses forward contracts and options to
hedge these currency exposures.  A portion of the Company's exposure is to
currencies which are not traded on open markets, such as those in Latin
America, and these are addressed, to the extent reasonably possible,
through managing net asset positions, product pricing, and other means,
such as component sourcing.

At July 1, 2000 and July 3, 1999, the Company had net outstanding foreign
exchange contracts totaling $4.0 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the
Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and
losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets,
liabilities, and transactions being hedged.  At July 1, 2000, deferred
gains totaled $33.1 million, and deferred losses totaled $4.7 million.  At
July 3, 1999, deferred gains totaled $3.4 million, and deferred losses
totaled $1.2 million.  The following table shows, in millions, the five
largest net foreign exchange hedge positions as of July 1, 2000 and July 3,
1999:

                        July 1,            July 3,
Buy (Sell)               2000               1999
Japanese Yen           (1,435)              (775)
Euro                     (819)              (590)
Chinese Renminbi         (600)              (180)
British Pound            (601)              (  5)
Malaysia Ringgit          135               (  8)

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if counterparties to
financial instruments fail to perform their obligations.  However, it does
not expect any counterparties, which presently have high credit ratings, to
fail to meet their obligations.

In June 1999, the Company's finance subsidiary entered into interest rate
swaps to change the characteristics of the interest rate payments on its
$500 million 6.75% Guaranteed Bonds due 2004 from fixed-rate payments to
short-term LIBOR based variable rate payments in order to match the funding
with its underlying assets.  Except for these interest rate swaps, as of
the end of the reporting period, the Company had no outstanding commodity
derivatives, currency swaps or options relating to either its debt
instruments or investments.  The Company does not have any derivatives to
hedge the value of its equity investments in affiliated companies.

Euro Conversion:

For disclosure regarding the impact to the Company from the introduction of
the euro, see the information contained under the caption "Euro Conversion"
on page F-23 of the appendix to the Company's Proxy Statement for its 2000
annual meeting of stockholders.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", subsequently amended by
SFAS No. 137 and SFAS No. 138, which the Company is required to adopt in
the first quarter of 2001.  SFAS 133 will require the Company to record all
derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The impact of SFAS 133 on
the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity, and results of
operations will depend upon a variety of factors, including future
interpretive guidance from the FASB and the extent of the Company's hedging
activities.  The Company is continuing to take the necessary steps to
implement SFAS 133.  The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 133
to materially affect its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or
results of operations.

In December 1999, the Securities & Exchange Commission issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin Number 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements" (SAB 101).  The guidelines in SAB 101 must be adopted during
the fourth quarter of 2000.  The Company does not expect the adoption of
these guidelines will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
position, liquidity or results of operations.

In March 2000, the FASB issued its Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation - an interpretation of
APB Opinion No. 25" (FIN 44).  FIN 44 applies prospectively to new awards,
exchanges of awards in a business combination, modifications to outstanding
awards, and changes in grantee status that occur on or after July 1, 2000,
except for the provisions related to repricings and the definition of an
employee which apply to awards issued after December 15,1998.  The Company
does not expect the implementation of these guidelines will have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of
operations.

Part II - Other Information

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings.

Motorola is currently a named defendant in seven cases arising out of
alleged groundwater, soil and air pollution in Phoenix and Scottsdale,
Arizona.  Baker et al. v. Motorola et al., filed on February 11, 1992, is a
class action involving six representative individual named plaintiffs,
alleging that Motorola and a number of other defendants contaminated the
soil, air and groundwater in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, diminishing
property values and exposing members of the class to possible adverse
health effects.  The court has now set January 8, 2001 as the start of
trial of the Scottsdale property subclass claims in the Baker case.

A class action, In Re Nextel Communications Securities Litigation, against
Nextel Communications, Inc., certain of its officers and directors and
Motorola for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, was pending in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.  On June 26,
2000, the court held a public hearing, approved the Stipulation of
Settlement previously presented by the parties and dismissed the case with
prejudice.

Motorola and several of its officers and directors are named defendants in
a consolidated class action, Kaufman, et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al., for
alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act and SEC Rule 10b-5.  The court has set a trial date of April 9, 2001.

Motorola has been a defendant in several cases arising out of its
manufacture and sale of portable cellular telephones.  Kane, et al., v.
Motorola, Inc., et al., filed on December 13, 1993 in the Circuit Court of
Cook County, Illinois, alleged that plaintiffs' brain cancer was caused by
or aggravated by a prototype communication device.  Plaintiffs have
appealed the summary judgment entered May 11, 2000 in Motorola's favor.
Jerald P. Busse, et al. v. Motorola, Inc. et al., filed on October 26, 1995
in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division, is a
class action alleging that defendants have failed to adequately warn
consumers of the alleged dangers of cellular telephones and challenging
ongoing safety studies as invasions of privacy.  On July 21, 2000, the
Court entered an order certifying a nationwide class of all subscribers
whose cellular telephone carrier agreed to provide information about the
subscriber to the entity conducting the study.

On October 16, 1998, the plaintiffs in Pennsylvania Bancshares, Inc. et al.
v. Motorola, Inc., et al., a purported class action filed on October 10,
1995 in the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, filed a
notice of voluntary dismissal with prejudice as to all claims for monetary
relief and without prejudice as to all claims for equitable relief.
Plaintiffs alleged that Motorola systematically engages in deceptive trade
practices, including without limitation, intentionally misrepresenting the
quality of certain types of cellular telephones.  On June 19, 2000, the
Court sustained Motorola's Preliminary Objections Regarding Plaintiff's
Failure to Allege a Valid Claim and dismissed all other motions filed by
Motorola as moot.

Silber, et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al., filed on August 1, 1995 in the
Supreme Court of The State of New York, County of Suffolk, which was
transferred from the County of New York, is an action wherein it is alleged
that a traffic accident was caused by the use of a cellular phone.  On
April 27, 1999, Motorola obtained summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims.
On July 24, 2000, the Appellate Division, Second Department, affirmed the
decision finding that Motorola's actions were not a proximate cause of the
accident.

See Item 3 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December
31, 1999 and Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Form 10-Q for the period
ended April 1, 2000 for additional disclosures regarding pending matters.

In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position, liquidity or results of operations of Motorola.

Item 2 - Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds.

(c)     Sales of Unregistered Securities

During June 2000, Motorola issued an aggregate of 11,493,243 shares of
common stock (for an aggregate sales price of approximately $95 million) to
7 holders of warrants issued by General Instrument Corporation ("GI") prior
to the merger of Motorola and GI, which was consummated on January 5, 2000.
Warrants issued by GI for an aggregate of an additional 35,570,082 shares
of Motorola common stock remain outstanding as of the date of this report.
Motorola has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-
36320) covering the resale of all such shares of common stock by the
holders thereof.  The issuances of these shares to the warrant holders were
deemed exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, by virtue of Section 4(2) thereof, as transactions not involving a
public offering.

     3.     SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN

sold or for which Benefits may be granted or received under the Plan, for
which Compensation may be paid to Non-Employee Directors in Common Stock
and restricted Common Stock under the Motorola Non-Employee Directors Stock
Plan and for which awards and grants payable in Common Stock and restricted
Common Stock may be made under the Motorola Long Range Incentive Plan of
1994 and the Motorola Executive Incentive Plan shall be (i) 37,500,000
Shares(as adjusted for the 3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000),
plus (ii) the total number of Shares with respect to which no options have
been granted under Motorola's Share Option Plan of 1996 on the Effective
Date, plus (iii) the number of Shares as to which options granted under
Motorola's Share Option Plan of 1996 terminate or expire without being
fully exercised, subject, in each case, to Sections 3.2 and 3.3.  Shares
issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued Shares or
issued Shares reacquired by Motorola.  No Participant may receive (i) Stock
Options relating to more than 900,000 Shares (reflecting adjustment for the
3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000) in any Plan Year (as adjusted
pursuant to Section 3.3), (ii) Restricted Stock relating to more than
300,000 Shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective
June 1, 2000) in any Plan Year (as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.3), (iii)
Stock Appreciation Rights relating to more than 150,000 Shares (reflecting
adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000) in any Plan
Year (as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.3) or (iv) Performance Shares
relating to more than 60,000 Shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1
stock split effective June 1, 2000) in any Plan Year (as adjusted pursuant
to Section 3.3).  The number of Shares which may be issued under the Plan
for Benefits other than Stock Options and which may be issued under the
other three plans named above in this Section 3.1 shall not exceed a total
of 15,000,000 Shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split
effective June 1, 2000), subject to reusage and adjustments under Sections
3.2 and 3.3; provided however, that the number of Shares which may be
issued under the Plan for Benefits other than Stock Options after February
25, 2000, shall not exceed a total of 3,000,000 shares (reflecting
adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000), subject to
reusage and adjustments under Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

     3.2     Reusage.  If a Stock Option expires or is terminated,
surrendered or canceled without having been fully exercised or if
Restricted Stock, Performance Shares or a Stock Appreciation Right is
forfeited or terminates without the issuance of all of the Shares subject
thereto, the Shares covered by such Benefits shall again be available for
use under the Plan.  Shares covered by a Benefit granted under the Plan
shall not be counted as used unless and until they are actually and
unconditionally issued and delivered to a Participant.  The number of
Shares which are transferred to Motorola by a Participant to pay the
exercise or purchase price of a Benefit shall be subtracted from the number
of Shares issued with respect to such Benefit for the purpose of counting
Shares used.  Shares withheld to pay withholding taxes in connection with
the exercise or payment of a Benefit shall not be counted as used.  Shares
covered by a Benefit granted under the Plan which is settled in cash shall
not be counted as used.

Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock, and the price of each of the
foregoing, as applicable, shall be appropriately adjusted by the Committee
to provide Participants with the same relative rights before and after such
adjustment.

     4.     EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

     4.1     Grant of Employee  Stock Options.  The Committee shall have
authority to grant Stock Options (ISOs or NSOs)  to Employees.  The
Committee shall determine the number of Shares subject to each Employee
Stock Option, the purchase price per Share, the term of the Employee Stock
Option, the time or times at which the Employee Stock Option may be
exercised, and all other terms and conditions of the Employee Stock Option.
The Option exercise price per Share of an Employee Stock Option may not be

Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any Employee Stock Option,
including the waiver or modification of any installment exercise
provisions.  The Committee may, in its discretion, delegate to members of
the Committee and/or one or more elected officers of Motorola the authority
to grant Stock Options to Employees who are not subject to Section 16 of
the Exchange Act.

     4.2      NSOs and ISOs.

     (a)     The Stock Option exercise price of any Stock Option may not be
     less than the Fair Market Value on the date of grant of the Shares of

     to ISOs:

          (i)   No ISO shall be granted to any Participant who, at the

          meaning of Section 422(b) of the Code) stock possessing more than
          ten percent (10%) of the total combined voting power of all
          classes of stock of Motorola.

          (ii)   The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time
          the Employee Stock Option is granted) of the Shares of Common
          Stock with respect to which one or more ISO's are exercisable for
          the first time by any individual Optionee during any calendar
          year (under all plans of Motorola and its Subsidiaries) shall not
          exceed $100,000.00.

          (iii)   Each ISO, by its terms, shall (1) not be exercisable
          after the expiration of ten (10) years after the date it is
          granted and (2) not be transferrable by the Optionee otherwise
          than by will or the applicable laws of descent and distribution
          or by operation of a death beneficiary designation made by the
          Optionee in accordance with rules established by the Committee
          and shall be exercisable during the Optionee's lifetime only by
          the Optionee or the Optionee's guardian or legal representative
          if the Optionee is legally incompetent.

     (c)     NSOs. Any NSO the grant of which is agreed to after February
     25, 2000 shall not be exercisable after the expiration of ten (10)
     years after the date it is granted.

     4.3     Exercise of Employee Stock Options; Payment.

     (a)     An Employee Stock Option may be exercised by the Optionee
     submitting to Motorola such form(s) as are prescribed for such
     purpose.  Motorola may require the surrender of the Employee Stock
     Option certificate if one has been issued.  No Employee Stock Option
     shall be exercisable for less than a minimum of fifty (50) Shares
     except in cases where the number of Shares represented by the Employee
     Stock Option being exercised is less than fifty (50), in which case,
     the Employee Stock Option shall not be exercisable for less than all
     shares represented by such Option.

     (b)     Payment for Shares purchased upon exercise of an Employee
     Stock Option shall be paid in full as permitted by Section 19.1 for
     all Shares purchased at the time of purchase. No fractional Shares may
     be purchased.

     4.4     Non-Exercise Period.  Except as provided herein for Optionees
who die while in the employ of Motorola or any Subsidiary or for a Change
in Control, no Employee Stock Option granted under the Plan may be
exercised prior to the expiration of the Non-Exercise Period.  No Employee
Stock Option may be exercised after expiration of its stated term.

     4.5     Effect of Termination of Employment on Employee  Stock
Options:

     (a)     Termination of Employment During the Non-Exercise Period.

          (i)     Except for a Change in Control and except for a
          disability leave of absence as provided in Section 4.5(a)(iii)
          hereof, if, during the Non-Exercise Period,  the Optionee's
          employment with Motorola and its Subsidiaries shall terminate for
          any reason (including retirement) other than death, transfer to
          an Affiliate and other than Total and Permanent Disability (as
          that term is defined in the Motorola Profit Sharing and
          Investment Plan) of the Optionee, as determined by the Committee
          or its designee, the Optionee's right to exercise the Employee
          Stock Option shall terminate and all rights thereunder shall
          cease; provided, however, if the Optionee's employment terminates
          by reason of the transfer of such Optionee to an Affiliate, the
          Committee shall have the power and authority, in its discretion,
          to determine whether or not any or all of the Employee Stock
          Options held by the Optionee shall terminate or shall continue in
          effect (in which case such Options shall be subject to all of the
          conditions of the Plan, including this Section 4.5, and such
          other conditions as the Committee may impose, with "termination
          of employment," "employment is terminated" or "employment shall
          have been terminated" or words of like import or intent meaning
          termination of employment with the Affiliate.)

          (ii)     If, during the Non-Exercise Period, an Optionee dies
          while in the employ of Motorola or any Subsidiary, the deceased
          Optionee's Successor-in-Interest shall have the right to
          exercise, in whole or in part, at any time during the remainder
          of the term of such Employee Stock Option, the entire amount of
          the Shares subject to such Employee Stock Option (without regard
          to any installment limitation on the exercise of the Employee
          Stock Option).  For purposes of the Plan, the term "Successor-in-
          Interest" shall mean the deceased Optionee's death beneficiary,
          personal representative, or any person who acquired the right to
          exercise such Employee Stock Option by bequest or inheritance or
          by reason of the laws of descent and distribution.

         (iii)     If, during the Non-Exercise Period, an Optionee's
         employment with Motorola and its Subsidiaries shall terminate
         because of the Total and Permanent Disability of the Optionee or
         if the Optionee shall be put on disability leave of absence status
         because of the Total and Permanent Disability of the Optionee,
         each Employee Stock Option held by such an Optionee which has a
         Non-Exercise Period in effect at the time of termination of
         employment or commencement of the disability leave of absence
         shall become exercisable at the time the applicable Non-Exercise
         Period elapses or terminates, and the Optionee shall then have the
         right to exercise, in whole or in part, each such Employee Stock
         Option for the entire amount of Shares subject to each such
         Employee Stock Option (without regard to any installment
         limitation on exercise of the Employee Stock Option) at any time
         during the remainder of the term of the Employee Stock Option.
         The unexercised portion of each Employee Stock Option shall
         terminate upon expiration of the term of such Stock Option, and
         any unexercised portion shall terminate immediately if and when
         the Optionee is employed by a competitor of Motorola  or any
         Subsidiary without written consent of the Committee.

     (b)     Termination of Employment After the Non-Exercise Period.

          (i)     By Termination of Employment Without Cause.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and
the Optionee's employment with Motorola and its Subsidiaries shall have
been terminated thereafter by Motorola or any Subsidiary without cause, the
Optionee shall have the right to exercise the then presently exercisable
unexercised portion of the Employee Stock Option at any time during a
period of twelve (12) months after the date of termination of employment.
The unexercised portion of the Employee Stock Option may be exercised, in
whole or in part, for the number of Shares which were or would have become
exercisable to the extent the Optionee could have exercised such Employee
Stock Option had the Optionee remained in the employ of Motorola or any
Subsidiary during the twelve (12) month period immediately following the
date of termination of employment.  Except as otherwise provided in Section
4.5(b)(vii) hereof, the  unexercised and/or unexercisable portion of each
Employee Stock Option shall terminate twelve (12) months after an
Optionee's employment with Motorola and its Subsidiaries shall have been so
terminated, and any unexercised and/or unexercisable portion shall
terminate immediately if and when the Optionee is employed by a competitor
of Motorola or any Subsidiary without the written consent of the Committee.

          (ii)     By Termination of Employment for Cause.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and the
Optionee's employment is terminated by Motorola or any Subsidiary for
cause, any unexercised portion of any Employee Stock Option granted to the
Optionee shall terminate with the Optionee's termination of employment.  As
used herein, the term "cause" means (a) the failure of the Optionee to
carry out the duties assigned to the Optionee as a result of incompetence
or willful neglect, as determined by the Committee, or (b) such other
reasons, including the existence of a conflict of interest, as the
Committee may determine.


          (iii)     By Voluntary Termination of Employment.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and the
Optionee voluntarily terminates employment with Motorola or any Subsidiary
for reasons other than the retirement of the Optionee, any unexercised
portion of the Optionee's Employee Stock Option shall terminate with the
Optionee's termination of employment.

          (iv)     By Retirement.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and the
Optionee's employment with Motorola or any Subsidiary shall have been
terminated because of the retirement of the Optionee from Motorola or any
Subsidiary  at age 55 or older, the Optionee shall have the right to
exercise, in whole or in part, the unexercised portion of any Employee
Stock Option held by such Optionee for the entire amount of Shares subject
to such Stock Option (without regard to any installment limitation on
exercise of the Employee Stock Option) at any time during the remainder of
the term of such Stock Option.  The unexercised portion of each Employee
Stock Option shall terminate upon expiration of the term applicable to each
such Employee Stock  Option, and any unexercised portion shall terminate
immediately if and when the Optionee is employed by a competitor of
Motorola or any Subsidiary without the written consent of the Committee.

     For purposes of this Section 4.5, if the Optionee is a participant in
Motorola's pension plan or the pension plan of any Subsidiary, the term
"retirement" shall mean the Optionee's retirement as provided for in the
applicable pension plan.  If the Optionee is not a participant in
Motorola's pension plan or the pension plan of any Subsidiary, "retirement"
of an Optionee shall be determined by the Committee.  In no event can
retirement take place prior to age 55 even if permitted under the
applicable pension plan.

          (v)     By Total and Permanent Disability.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated, and the
Optionee's employment with Motorola and its Subsidiaries shall have been
terminated because of the Total and Permanent Disability of the Optionee or
if the Optionee shall be put on disability leave of absence status because
of the Total and Permanent Disability of the Optionee, the Optionee shall
have the right to exercise, in whole or in part, the unexercised portion of
any Employee Stock Option held by such Optionee for the entire amount of
Shares subject to such Employee Stock Option (without regard to any
installment limitation on exercise of the Employee Stock Option) at any
time during the remainder of the term of the Employee Stock Option.  The
unexercised portion of each Employee Stock Option shall terminate upon
expiration of the term of each such Employee Stock Option, and any
unexercised portion shall terminate immediately if and when the Optionee is
employed by a competitor of Motorola or any Subsidiary without the written
consent of the Committee.

          (vi)     By Death.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and the
Optionee dies while in the employ of Motorola or any Subsidiary, the
unexercised portion of the Employee Stock Option may be exercised, in whole
or in part, at any time during the remainder of the term of the Employee
Stock Option by the Optionee's Successor-in-Interest, for the entire number
of Shares subject to the Employee Stock Option (without regard to any
installment limitation on exercise of the Employee Stock Option).

          (vii)     Effect of Death After Termination of Employment Without
Cause or Retirement.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and the
Optionee dies during the twelve (12) month period immediately following the
Optionee's termination of employment by Motorola or any Subsidiary without
cause and at the time of death such Optionee is not employed by a
competitor of Motorola or any Subsidiary (or while employed by a competitor
of Motorola or any Subsidiary with the written consent of the Committee),
the unexercised portion of the Employee Stock Option may be exercised by
the Optionee's Successor-in-Interest at any time during the remainder of
the term of the Employee Stock Option, in whole or in part, for the number
of Shares which were or would have become exercisable had the Optionee
survived for the remainder of the term of the Employee Stock Option,
without regard to the requirement of exercise within twelve (12) months
after termination of employment without cause.

     If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and the
Optionee dies after retirement prior to the expiration of the term of the
Employee Stock Option, and, if at the time of death such Optionee is not
employed by a competitor of Motorola or any Subsidiary (or while employed
by a competitor of Motorola or any Subsidiary with the written consent of
the Committee), the unexercised portion of the Employee Stock Option may be
exercised for the entire number of Shares subject to such Employee Stock
Option (without regard to any installment limitation on exercise of the
Employee Stock Option), by the Optionee's Successor-in-Interest at any time
during the remainder of the term of the Employee Stock Option.

          (viii)     By Transfer of Optionee to an Affiliate.

      If the Non-Exercise Period shall have elapsed or terminated and the
Optionee's employment with Motorola and its Subsidiaries shall terminate by
reason of the transfer of such Optionee to an Affiliate, the Committee
shall have the power and authority, in its discretion, to determine whether
or not any or all of the Employee Stock Options held by the Optionee shall
continue in effect for the remainder of the term of such Employee Stock
Option or for the period otherwise applicable under the provisions of the
Plan. Any Employee Stock Option which the Committee permits to continue in
effect beyond the period otherwise applicable under the Plan shall be
subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, including this
Section 4.5 and such other conditions as the Committee may impose (with
"termination of employment", "employment shall terminate", "terminates
employment", "employment is terminated" or "employment shall have been
terminated" or words of like import or intent meaning termination of
employment with the Affiliate).

     (c)     Procedure on Death.  No transfer of an Employee Stock Option
     by an Optionee pursuant to Section 4.5 (a)(ii), (b)(vi) and (b)(vii)
     above, by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, shall be
     effective unless Motorola shall have been furnished with written
     notice thereof and a copy of the will, if any, and/or such other
     evidence as the Committee may deem necessary to establish the validity
     of the transfer and the acceptance by the Successor-in-interest or
     Successors-in-interest of the terms and conditions of the Employee
     Stock Option, and under no circumstances shall the right of any such
     Successor-in-Interest to exercise any such Employee Stock Option
     extend beyond the applicable period specified in sub-paragraph
     (a)(ii), (b)(vi) or (b)(vii) above, or beyond the expiration of the
     term of such Employee Stock Option.

     (d)     Leaves of Absence and Lay-offs.  If an Optionee is placed on
     leave of absence status (except as provided in Section 4.5 (a)(iii) or
     (b)(v) above) by Motorola or any Subsidiary, each Employee Stock
     Option then held by the Optionee, whether exercisable or non-
     exercisable, shall be suspended at such time, but the period of time
     during which the Optionee is on leave of absence shall be counted in
     determining when the Non-Exercise Period elapses.  If an Optionee is
     placed on lay-off status by Motorola or any Subsidiary, any then non-
     exercisable Employee Stock Option shall terminate and any then
     exercisable Employee Stock Option may be exercised during the period
     of twelve (12) months from the date the Optionee is placed on lay-off
     status and shall be suspended thereafter to the extent not exercised.
     In any case, the unexercised portion of each suspended Employee Stock
     Option shall either (i) terminate upon the Optionee's termination of
     employment with Motorola and its Subsidiaries or (ii) be reinstated
     upon such Optionee returning from leave of absence or lay-off status
     to active employment status with Motorola or any Subsidiary.

     (e)     Meaning of Termination of Employment.  Wherever in this
     Article or elsewhere in the Plan the words "termination of employment,
     employment is terminated, employment shall terminate or employment
     shall have been terminated" or words of like import or intent are
     used, they shall mean the last day worked by the Participant rather
     than the last day the Participant is on the payroll of Motorola or any
     Subsidiary.

     5.     RESTRICTED STOCK

     5.1     Grants of Restricted Stock.  The Committee may grant Benefits
in Shares available under Article 3  of the Plan as Restricted Stock.
Restricted Stock consists of Shares of Common Stock which are transferred
without payment, or sold at a specified price, as determined by the
Committee, by Motorola to a Participant, but subject to a substantial risk
of forfeiture and to restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the
Participant.  The Committee shall determine the eligible Employees to whom,
and the time or times at which, grants of Restricted Stock will be made,
the number of Shares to be granted, the price to be paid, the time or times
within which the Shares covered by such grants shall be subject to
forfeiture, the time or times at which the restrictions will terminate, and
all other terms and conditions of the grants.

     5.2     Price, Agreement, Stock Certificates, Escrow.  The recipient
of a Restricted Stock grant shall not have any rights with respect to such
grant unless and until such recipient has executed and delivered to
Motorola an Agreement evidencing the grant.  The purchase price, if any,
for Shares of Restricted Stock shall be paid in cash and in full for all
Shares of Restricted Stock then to be delivered.   Grants of Restricted
Stock must be accepted within such period after the grant date as the
Committee may specify at the time of grant, by executing an Agreement and
paying the price required.  Each Participant receiving a Restricted Stock
grant may be issued a stock certificate in respect of such Shares of
Restricted Stock.  Such certificate, if issued, shall be registered in the
name of such Participant, and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to
the terms, conditions, and restrictions applicable to such grant.  The
Committee may require that the stock certificates evidencing such Shares be
held in escrow by Motorola until the restrictions thereon shall have
terminated, and that, as a condition of any Restricted Stock grant, the
Participant shall have delivered to Motorola a stock power, endorsed in
blank, relating to the Restricted Stock covered by such grant.

     5.3     Restrictions.  All Shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject
to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee may determine,
including, without limitation, any or all of the following restrictions and
conditions:

     (a)     a prohibition against the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge
     or encumbrance of the Shares of Restricted Stock, such prohibition to
     terminate at such time or times (including the passage of time only)
     as the Committee shall determine, whether in installments or
     otherwise, or at the time of death, Total and Permanent Disability or
     retirement, or based on service, of the holder of such Shares, or
     otherwise as the Committee may provide;

     (b)     a provision that the holder of Shares of Restricted Stock
     forfeit, or in the case of Shares sold to a Participant, resell back
     to Motorola at the price the Participant paid, all or part of such
     Shares in the event of termination of his or her employment for any
     reason other than death, Total and Permanent Disability or retirement
     during any period in which such Shares are subject to restrictions; or
     a provision vesting such Shares in the event of termination of
     employment; or

     (c)     a provision that the holder of Shares of Restricted Stock
     forfeit, or in the case of Shares sold to a Participant, resell back
     to Motorola at the price the Participant paid, such Shares in the
     event the Participant engages, directly or indirectly, in any activity
     which is in competition with any activity of Motorola or any
     Subsidiary or in any action or conduct which is in any manner adverse
     or in any way contrary to the interests of Motorola or any Subsidiary
     unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  The determination of
     whether a Participant is or has engaged in any competitive activity or
     in any action or conduct which is adverse or contrary to the interests
     of Motorola or any of its Subsidiaries shall be made by the Committee,
     and such determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all
     parties.

     The Committee shall have the right at any time to accelerate, reduce
or terminate any restrictions, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.

     5.4     Termination of Restrictions.  Promptly after the termination
of the restrictions, by lapse of time or otherwise, without a prior
forfeiture, with respect to Shares of Restricted Stock, a certificate for
such Shares shall be delivered free of all restrictions and legends
together with deferred dividends, if any, to the Participant or to the
Participant's Successor-in-Interest.  If a stock certificate was previously
delivered to the Participant, the replacement certificate will not be
delivered to the Participant until the previously delivered certificate is
returned to Motorola in a form acceptable for transfer, free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances.

     5.5     Stockholder Rights.  Subject to the applicable restrictions,
the Participant may be given, with respect to the Shares of Restricted
Stock, any or all rights of a stockholder of Motorola, including the right
to vote the Shares, and the right to receive any cash or stock dividends.
The Committee, in its sole discretion, as determined at the time of grant,
may permit or require the payment of cash dividends to be deferred and, if
the Committee so determines, reinvested in additional Restricted Stock to
the extent Shares are available under Article 3 or otherwise be reinvested.
The Committee may require that stock dividends issued with respect to
Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of Restricted Stock
that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions
that apply to the Shares with respect to which such dividends are issued.

     5.6     Payment for Employee Stock Option.  The Committee may, at any
time, and in its sole discretion, allow a Participant to use his or her
Restricted Stock during the period the restrictions are in effect as
payment of the Employee Stock Option exercise price for Employee Stock
Options which he or she has been granted.  In such an event, a number of
the Shares issued upon the exercise of the Employee Stock Option, equal to
the number of Shares of Restricted Stock used as payment therefor, shall be
subject to the same restrictions as the Restricted Stock so used, plus any
additional restrictions that may be imposed by the Committee.

     5.7
     Substitution of Rights.  Prior to the end of the period the
restrictions are in effect with respect to any Shares of Restricted Stock
granted to a Participant, the Committee may, with the consent of the
Participant, substitute an unsecured obligation of Motorola to pay cash or
stock (on such reasonable terms and conditions as the Committee may, in its
sole discretion, determine) in lieu of its obligations under this Article 5
to deliver unrestricted Shares plus accrued dividends, if any.

     5.8     Cash Awards and Restricted Stock.  The Committee, at the time
it grants Restricted Stock to a Participant or at anytime thereafter, may
grant a corresponding Cash Award which will entitle the Participant to
receive cash as of the date as of which the Restricted Stock is transferred
to him or her pursuant to paragraph 5.4, in an amount specified by the
Committee.  Any such Cash Award shall be in addition to the Participant's
rights to the Shares of Restricted Stock and shall be subject to such
additional terms and conditions, if any, as the Committee determines which
are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Plan.  The
Committee may, at any time, grant unrestricted Shares (in lieu of such a
Cash Award and subject to the limitations thereof) to any Participant under
the Plan subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may
determine.

     6.     NON-EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

     6.1     Automatic Grant of Non-Employee Stock Options.  On June 1,
1998 and on June 1 of each Plan Year after 1998 in which the Plan is in
effect, each individual elected, re-elected or continuing as a Non-Employee
Director shall automatically receive a NSO covering 15,000 (reflecting
adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000) Shares, or
such greater number of Shares as shall be determined by the Board (a "Non-
Employee Stock Option").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, on that day,
the General Counsel of Motorola determines, in his or her sole discretion,
that Motorola is in possession of material, undisclosed information about
Motorola, then the annual grant of NSOs to Non-Employee Directors shall be
suspended until the second day after public dissemination of such
information and the price, exercisability date and Non-Employee Stock
Option Period shall then be determined by reference to such later date.  If
Common Stock is not reported as traded on the New York Stock Exchange -
Composite Transactions on any date a grant would otherwise be awarded, then
the grant shall be made the next day thereafter on which Common Stock is so
traded.

     6.2     Price.  The Stock Option exercise price of a Non-Employee
Stock Option shall be the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to such
Stock Option on the date of grant.

     6.3     Exercisability.  A Non-Employee Stock Option granted under the
Plan shall become exercisable twelve (12) months after the date of grant
(except as otherwise provided in Section 6.6 for retirement and Section 6.7
for death which occurs during such period and in Article 17 if a Change in
Control occurs during such period) and shall expire, except as otherwise
provided herein, 10 years after the date of grant ("Non-Employee Stock
Option Period").

     6.4     Payment.  The Non-Employee Stock Option exercise price shall
be paid in full as permitted by Section 19.1 for all Shares purchased at
the time the Non-Employee Stock Option is exercised.  No fractional Shares
may be purchased.  Motorola may require the surrender of the Non-Employee
Stock Option certificate if one has been issued and no Non-Employee Stock
Option may be exercised for less than fifty (50) Shares, except in cases
where the number of shares represented by the Non-Employee Stock Option
being exercised is less than fifty (50), in which case the Non-Employee
Stock Option shall not be exercisable for less than all Shares represented
by such Stock Option.

     6.5     Termination.  Upon cessation of services as a Non-Employee
Director (for reasons other than retirement as defined in Section 6.6
hereof or death) only those Non-Employee Stock Options immediately
exercisable at the date of cessation of service shall be exercisable by the
Non-Employee Director.  Such Non-Employee Stock Options must be exercised
within 30 days after cessation of service (but in no event after the
expiration of the Non-Employee Stock Option Period) or they shall be
forfeited.  If, however, the Non-Employee Director during or after his or
her service on the Board, engages, directly or indirectly, in any activity
which is in competition with any activity of Motorola or any Subsidiary or
in any action or conduct which is in any manner adverse or in any way
contrary to the interests of Motorola, or any Subsidiary, any unexercised
portion of such Non-Employee Stock Options shall immediately terminate,
unless otherwise determined by the Chief Executive Officer of Motorola.
The determination of whether a Director is or has engaged in any
competitive activity or in any action or conduct which is adverse or
contrary to the interests of Motorola or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
made by the Chief Executive Officer of Motorola, and such determination
shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties.

     6.6     Retirement.  As used in this Article 6, the term "retirement"
shall mean, for Non-Employee Directors, resignation at or after age 65,
failure to stand for re-election at or after age 65 or failure to be re-
elected at or after age 65.  Upon retirement, all Non-Employee Stock
Options previously granted to a Non-Employee Director shall become or
continue to be exercisable, except as otherwise provided herein.  Such Non-
Employee Stock Options must be exercised prior to the expiration of the
Non-Employee Stock Option Period or they shall be forfeited.

     6.7     Death.  Upon the death of a Non-Employee Director, all Non-
Employee Stock Options previously granted to the Non-Employee Director
shall become exercisable by his or her Successor-in-Interest, except as
otherwise provided herein.  Such Non-Employee Stock Options can be
exercised during the remainder of the Non-Employee Stock Option Period.

     6.8     Amendments.  No amendment may revoke or alter in a manner
unfavorable to a Non-Employee Director holding Non-Employee Stock Options
any Non-Employee Stock Options then outstanding, without such Non-Employee
Director's approval.

     6.9     Interpretation.  The Chief Executive Officer of  Motorola
shall administer, construe and interpret this Article 6, whose decisions
shall be conclusive and binding on all parties.  The Chief Executive
Officer of Motorola is authorized, subject to the provisions of this
Article 6, from time to time to establish such rules and regulations as he
or she may deem appropriate for the proper administration or operation of
this Article 6.  Non-Employee Stock Options may be evidenced by
certificates or Agreements, at the option of the Chief Executive Officer of
Motorola.

     7.     MOTOROLA LONG RANGE INCENTIVE PLAN OF 1994,  MOTOROLA EXECUTIVE
INCENTIVE PLAN AND MOTOROLA NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS STOCK PLAN

     Awards and grants made under the Motorola Long Range Incentive Plan of
1994 and the Motorola Executive Incentive Plan which are payable in Common
Stock or restricted Common Stock, or both, shall be paid from the Shares
reserved or available for issuance under Section 3 of the Plan.
Compensation of Non-Employee Directors which is payable in Common Stock or
restricted Common Stock, or both, under the Motorola Non-Employee Directors
Stock Plan shall be paid from Shares reserved or available for issuance
under Section 3 of the Plan.

     8.     PERFORMANCE SHARES

     8.1     Description.  Performance Shares are the right of a
Participant to whom a grant of such Shares is made to receive Shares or
cash or a combination of Shares and cash equal to the Fair Market Value of
such Shares at a future date in accordance with the terms of such grant.

     8.2     Grant.  The Committee may grant an award of Performance
Shares.  The award shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the
Committee deems appropriate.  The number of Performance Shares and the
terms and conditions of the grant shall be set forth in the applicable
Agreement.

     8.3     Performance Objectives.  Each Performance Share shall be
subject to conditions established by the Committee, which may include, but
are not limited to, achievement of specific business objectives, attainment
of growth rates, attainment of profit and/or other performance objectives
for Motorola or one of its operating units to be achieved by the end of a
specified period or other measurements of performance.  If the established
performance objectives are achieved, the Participant shall be paid in
Shares of Common Stock equal to the number of Performance Shares initially
granted to that Participant or in cash equal to the Fair Market Value of
such Shares as specified in the Agreement or in a combination of Shares and
cash.  If such objectives are not met, each award of Performance Shares may
provide for lesser payments in accordance with formulas established in the
award.

     8.4     Not Stockholder.  The award of Performance Shares to a
Participant shall not create any rights in such Participant as a
stockholder of Motorola until the issuance of Shares of Common Stock with
respect to an award.

     8.5     No Adjustments.  No adjustment shall be made in Performance
Shares awarded on account of cash or stock dividends which may be paid or
other rights which may be issued to the holders of Common Stock prior to
the end of any period for which performance objectives were established and
Common Stock or cash is issued to the Participant.

     8.6     Nontransferability.  Performance Shares may not be
transferred, assigned or pledged by the holder thereof except as may be
provided in the Agreement.

     9.     STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

     9.1     Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights.  The Committee shall have
authority to grant Stock Appreciation Rights to Employees.  The Committee
shall determine the number of Shares subject to each Stock Appreciation
Right, the term of the Stock Appreciation Right, the time or times at which
the Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised and all other terms and
conditions of the Stock Appreciation Right.  A Stock Appreciation Right is
a right, denominated in Shares, to receive, upon exercise of the right, in
whole or in part, without payment to Motorola, an amount, payable in
Shares, in cash (in U.S. dollars, or the currency of the country of the
Employee's citizenship or of the country in which the Employee resides, at
the election of Motorola), or a combination of Shares and cash (in U.S.
dollars, or the currency of the country of the Employee's citizenship or of
the country in which the Employee resides, at the election of Motorola) as
the Committee shall determine at the time the right is exercised) that is
equal to the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of Common Stock on the
date of exercise of the right over (ii) the Fair Market Value of Common
Stock on the date of grant of the right multiplied by the number of Shares
for which the right is exercised.

     9.2     Non-Exercise Period.  Except as provided in Section 9.3
hereof, no Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan may be exercised
prior to the expiration of the Non-Exercise Period.  No Stock Appreciation
Right may be exercised after expiration of its stated term.

     9.3     Application of Certain Terms and Conditions to Stock
Appreciation Rights.  The terms and conditions of Section 4.5 of the Plan
applicable to Employee Stock Options shall also apply to Stock Appreciation
Rights with the term "Optionee" changed to "grantee", the term "Employee
Stock Option" changed to "Stock Appreciation Right" and with such other
changes as may be necessary to conform the language of Section 4.5 to apply
to Stock Appreciation Rights.

     10.     STOCK AWARDS

     A Stock Award consists of the transfer by Motorola to an Employee of
Shares of Common Stock, without payment therefor, as additional
compensation for his or her services to the Company or a Subsidiary.  The
number of Shares to be awarded and transferred to any Employee shall be
determined by the Committee.

     11.     CASH AWARDS

     A Cash Award consists of a monetary payment made by Motorola to an
Employee as additional compensation for his or her services to the Company
or a Subsidiary.  A Cash Award may be made in tandem with another Benefit
or may be made independently of any other Benefit.  The amount of any
monetary payment constituting a Cash Award shall be determined by the
Committee in its sole discretion.  Cash Awards may be subject to other
terms and conditions, which may vary from time to time and among Employees,
as the Committee determines to be appropriate.

     12.     ELIGIBILITY

     The Participants and the Benefits they receive under the Plan shall be
determined by the Committee, except for Non-Employee Stock Options which
shall be automatically granted to Non-Employee Directors under Article 6
and except to the extent authority has been delegated under Section 13.1
hereof.  In making its determinations, the Committee shall consider past,
present and expected future contributions of Employees to Motorola and its
Subsidiaries.

     13.     ADMINISTRATION

     13.1     Committee.  The Plan (except for Article 6 and the Non-
Employee Stock Options automatically granted thereunder) shall be
administered by the Committee; provided, however, if at any time Rule 16b-3
and Section 162(m) of the Code, and any implementing regulations (and any
successor provisions thereof), so permit without adversely affecting the
ability of the Plan to comply with the conditions for exemption from
Section 16 of the Exchange Act (or any successor provision) provided by
Rule 16b-3 and the exemption from the limitations on the deductibility of
certain executive compensation provided by Section 162(m), the Committee
may delegate the administration of the Plan in whole or in part, on such
terms and conditions, to such other person or persons as it may determine
in its discretion.  References to the Committee hereunder shall include the
Board where appropriate.  The membership of the Committee or such successor
committee shall be constituted so as to comply at all times with the
applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3 and Section 162(m).

     13.2     Authority.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, and except for
the Non-Employee Stock Options granted under Article 6 (over which the
Committee shall have no discretion), the Committee shall have complete
power and authority to:

     (a)     determine the individuals to whom Benefits are granted, the
     type and amounts of Benefits to be granted and the time of all such
     grants;

     (b)  determine the terms, conditions and provisions of, and
     restrictions relating to, each Benefit granted;

     (c)  administer, interpret and construe the Plan, the Benefits and all
     Agreements;

     (d)  prescribe, amend and revoke rules and regulations relating to the
     Plan;

     (e)  determine the content and form of all Agreements;

     (f)  maintain accounts, records and ledgers relating to Benefits;

     (g)  maintain records concerning its decisions and proceedings;

     (h) employ agents, attorneys, accountants or other persons for such
     purposes as the Committee considers necessary or desirable;

     (i)  take, at any time, any action permitted by Section 17.1
     irrespective of whether any Change in Control has occurred or is
     imminent; and

     (j)  do and perform all acts which it may deem necessary or
     appropriate for the administration of the Plan and carry out the
     purposes of the Plan.

     (k)  determine all questions relating to Benefits under the Plan.

     13.3     Replacement.  The Committee may permit a Participant to elect
to surrender a Benefit in exchange for a new Benefit, excluding the
replacement of a Stock Option with a Stock Option at a lower price than the
Stock Option surrendered.

     13.4     Tandem Awards.  Benefits may be granted by the Committee
singly or in combination or tandem with other Benefits.

     13.5     Determinations.  All determinations of the Committee shall be
final, binding and conclusive upon all persons, including Motorola and its
Subsidiaries and Participants and their respective legal representatives,
Successors-in Interest and permitted assigns and upon all other persons
claiming by, through, under or against any of them.

     14.     AMENDMENT

      Except as hereinafter provided, and except as may be required for
compliance with Rule 16b-3 and Section 162(m) of the Code, the Board or the
Committee shall have the right and power to amend the Plan at any time and
from time to time.  Only the Board may amend Article 6 of the Plan, subject
to such Article and subject to compliance with Rule 16b-3.  Neither the
Board nor the Committee may amend the Plan in a manner which would impair
or adversely affect the rights of the holder of a Benefit without the
holder's consent.  If the Code or any other applicable statute, rule or
regulation, including, but not limited to, those of any securities
exchange, requires stockholder approval with respect to the Plan or any
type of Plan amendment, then to the extent so required, stockholder
approval shall be obtained.

     15.     TERM AND TERMINATION

     15.1     Term.  The Plan shall commence as of the Effective Date and,
subject to the terms of the Plan, including those in Section 20.8 requiring
stockholder approval for implementation or limiting the period over which
ISOs or any other Benefits may be granted, shall continue in full force and
effect until four (4) years from the Effective Date, unless sooner
terminated by the Board.

     15.2     Termination.  The Plan may be terminated at any time by the
Board.  Termination shall not in any manner impair or adversely affect any
Benefit outstanding at the time of termination.

     16.     MODIFICATION OR TERMINATION

     16.1     General.  Subject to the provisions of Section 16.2, the
amendment or termination of the Plan shall not impair or adversely affect a
Participant's right to any Benefit granted prior to such amendment or
termination.

     16.2     Committee's Right.  Any Benefit granted may be converted,
modified, forfeited or canceled, in whole or in part, by the Committee if
and to the extent permitted in the Plan or applicable Agreement or with the
consent of the Participant to whom such Benefit was granted.  The Committee
may grant Benefits on such terms and conditions, which may be different
than those specified in the Plan, as it may deem desirable in order to
comply with, or make available the benefits of, the laws and regulations of
any foreign jurisdiction, to assure the viability of Benefits granted and
to enable Participants, regardless of where employed, to receive Benefits
under the Plan and such laws and regulations.

     17.     CHANGE IN CONTROL

     17.1     Benefit Vesting and Payment.

     (a)     Stock Options.  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,
     each Stock Option outstanding on the date on which the Change in
     Control occurs shall immediately become exercisable in full for the
     remainder of its term and each Participant holding Stock Options shall
     have the right, at his or her election made during a period of sixty
     (60) days following the date on which the Change in Control occurs,
     to have Motorola purchase any or all such Stock Options for an
     immediate lump-sum cash payment equal to the product of (1) the
     excess, if any, of the higher of (i) the average of the high and low
     sale prices of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock
     Exchange - Composite Transactions on the date immediately prior to the
     date of payment, or if Shares did not trade on such date, on the last
     previous day on which Shares traded prior to such date, or (ii) the
     highest per Share price for Common Stock actually paid in connection
     with the Change in Control, over the per Share exercise price of each
     such Stock Option held, and (2) the number of Shares covered by each
     such Stock Option.

     (b)  Restricted Stock.  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,
     the restrictions on all Shares of Restricted Stock outstanding on the
     date on which the Change in Control occurs shall be automatically
     terminated and each Participant holding Restricted Stock shall have
     the right to receive unrestricted Shares in substitution for the
     Shares of Restricted Stock or, at his or her election made during a
     period of sixty (60) days following the date on which the Change in
     Control occurs, the right to have Motorola purchase any or all Shares
     of Restricted Stock for an immediate lump-sum cash payment equal to
     the product of (1) the higher of (i) the average of the high and low
     sale prices of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock
     Exchange  - Composite Transactions on the date immediately prior to
     the date of payment, or if Shares did not trade on such date, on the
     last previous day on which Shares traded prior to such date, or (ii)
     the highest per Share price for Common Stock actually paid in
     connection with the Change in Control and (2) the number of Shares of
     such Restricted Stock, plus the value of any related Cash Award
     relating to such Restricted Stock.

     (c)     Performance Shares.  Upon the occurrence of a Change in
     Control, any performance objectives with respect to any Performance
     Shares previously granted, but still considered outstanding (as a
     right to receive Shares at a future date and any related Cash Award)
     shall be deemed to have been attained to the full and maximum extent,
     and Shares of Common Stock and any related Cash Award shall be paid to
     the Participant in an amount or amounts determined in accordance with
     the terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Agreement.

     (d)     Stock Appreciation Rights.  Upon the occurrence of a Change in
     Control, each Stock Appreciation Right outstanding on the date on
     which the Change in Control occurs shall immediately become
     exercisable in full for the remainder of its term and each Participant
     holding a Stock Appreciation Right shall have the right, at his or her
     election made during a period of sixty (60) days following the date on
     which the Change in Control occurs, to have Motorola purchase any or
     all such Stock Appreciation Rights for an immediate lump-sum cash
     payment equal to the product of (1) the higher of (i) the average of
     the high and low sale prices of the Common Stock as reported on the
     New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions on the date
     immediately prior to the date of payment, or if Shares did not trade
     on such date, on the last previous day on which Shares traded prior to
     such date, or (ii) the highest per Share price for Common Stock
     actually paid in connection with the Change in Control and (2) the
     number of Shares covered by each such Stock Appreciation Right.

     (e)     Other Benefits.  Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control,
     any terms and conditions with respect to other Benefits previously
     granted under the Plan, shall be deemed to be fully satisfied and the
     Benefits shall be paid out immediately to the Participants in amounts
     determined in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in
     the applicable grant, award or Agreement.

     17.2     Change in Control.  A Change in Control shall mean:

     A Change in Control of a nature that would be required to be reported
in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated
under the Exchange Act whether or not Motorola is then subject to such
reporting requirement; provided that, without limitation, such a Change in
Control shall be deemed to have occurred if (A) any "person" or "group" (as
such terms are used in Section 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or
becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of Motorola representing 20% or
more of the combined voting power of Motorola's then outstanding securities
(other than Motorola or any employee benefit plan of Motorola; and, for
purposes of the Plan, no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred
as a result of the "beneficial ownership," or changes therein, of
Motorola's securities by either of the foregoing), (B) there shall be
consummated (i) any consolidation or merger of Motorola in which Motorola
is not the surviving or continuing corporation or pursuant to which Shares
of Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property,
other than a merger of Motorola in which the holders of Common Stock
immediately prior to the merger have (directly or indirectly) at least an
80% ownership interest in the outstanding common stock of the surviving
corporation immediately after the merger, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange
or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions)
of all, or substantially all, of the assets of Motorola, (C) the
stockholders of Motorola approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation
or dissolution of Motorola, or (D) as the result of, or in connection with,
any cash tender offer, exchange offer, merger or other business
combination, sale of assets, proxy or consent solicitation (other than by
the Board), contested election or substantial stock accumulation (a
"Control Transaction"), the members of the Board immediately prior to the
first public announcement relating to such Control Transaction shall
thereafter cease to constitute a majority of the Board.


     18.     AGREEMENTS AND TRANSFER OF BENEFITS

     18.1     Grant Evidenced by Agreement.  The grant of any Benefit under
the Plan may be evidenced by, and as required by Sections 5.2 and 8.2
hereof shall be evidenced by, an Agreement which describes the specific
Benefit granted and describes or refers to the terms and conditions of the
Benefit.  The granting of any Benefit may be subject to, and conditioned
upon, the recipient's execution of any Agreement required by the Committee
or the Plan.  Except as otherwise provided in an Agreement, all capitalized
terms used in the Agreement shall have the same meaning as in the Plan, and
each Agreement shall be subject to all of the terms of the Plan.

     18.2     Provisions of Agreement.  Each Agreement shall contain such
provisions that the Committee or Chief Executive Officer of Motorola, as
appropriate, shall determine to be necessary, desirable and appropriate for
the Benefit granted.  ISOs may be evidenced by Incentive Stock Option
certificates and NSOs may be evidenced by Non-Qualified Stock Option
certificates.  Each Agreement may include, but shall not be limited to, the
following with respect to any Benefit:  description of the type of Benefit;
the Benefit's duration; its transferability; if a Stock Option, the
exercise price, the exercise period, the Non-Exercise Period and the person
or persons who may exercise the Stock Option; the effect upon such Benefit
of the Participant's death or other termination of employment; the
Benefit's conditions; when, if, and how any Benefit may be forfeited,
converted into another Benefit, modified, exchanged for another Benefit, or
replaced; and the restrictions on any Shares purchased by, received by, or
granted to, a Participant under the Plan.

     18.3     Transfer of Benefits.  Except as set forth in the next
sentence of this Section 18.3, a Benefit shall not be transferable by a
Participant other than by operation of a death beneficiary designation made
by the Participant in accordance with rules established by the Committee,
or the Chief Executive Officer of Motorola, as appropriate, by will or the
applicable laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable during
the Participant's lifetime only by him or her or his or her guardian or
legal representative if the Participant is legally incompetent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, except to the extent that it would cause the
Plan to fail to meet the conditions required to be met under Rule 16b-3,
the Committee shall have the power and authority to provide, as a term of
any NSO, that such NSO may be transferred without consideration by the Non-
Employee Director or the Optionee to a member or members of his or her
immediate family (i.e., a child, children, grandchild, grandchildren, or
spouse) and/or to a trust or trusts for the benefit of an immediate family
member or family members.


     19.     PAYMENT AND DEFERRAL

     19.1     Payment.  Upon the exercise of a Stock Option or in the case
of any other Benefit that requires a payment to Motorola, the amount due
Motorola is to be paid:

     (a)     in cash;

     (b)     by the transfer to Motorola of Shares owned by the Participant
     valued at Fair Market Value on the date of transfer;

     (c)     by any combination of the payment methods specified in (a) and
     (b) above; or

     (d)     such other manner as may be authorized from time to time by
     the Committee; and

     (e)     as provided in Section 5.6 hereof;

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any method of payment other than (a) and (b)
may be used only with the approval of the Committee, or if and to the
extent so provided in the applicable Agreement.

     19.2     Deferral.  The right to receive any Benefit (other than Non-
Employee Stock Options) under the Plan may, at the written request of the
Participant and in the sole discretion of the Committee, be deferred for
such period and upon such terms as the Committee shall determine, which may
include crediting of interest on deferrals of cash and crediting of
dividends on deferrals denominated in Shares.

     20.     GENERAL

     20.1     Tax Withholding.  At the time Motorola is required to
withhold any Federal Insurance Contribution Act ("FICA") tax and/or any
federal, state or local tax of any kind with respect to any award or grant
of any Benefit or the exercise of any Stock Option or the distribution or
receipt of Common Stock under the Plan, the Participant shall pay to
Motorola the amount of any such FICA, federal, state or local tax or taxes
required to be withheld.  The obligations of Motorola under the Plan shall
be conditional on payment of all withholding taxes, and Motorola shall have
the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind under the
Plan or otherwise due to the Participant.  Withholding tax obligations may
be settled, in whole or in part, with Common Stock including Common Stock
that is part of the Benefit that gives rise to the withholding requirement.
At any time when a Participant is required to pay to Motorola an amount
required to be withheld under applicable tax laws in connection with an
award or grant, a distribution or receipt of Common Stock or upon exercise
of a Stock Option, the Participant may satisfy this obligation in whole or
in part by transfer to Motorola of Shares previously owned by the
Participant, by electing (the "Election") to have Motorola withhold from
the distribution Shares of Common Stock having a value equal (as near as
possible) to the amount required to be withheld or by a combination of such
means, provided, however, that the amount of federal, state and local
income taxes that may be paid by transfer or withholding of Shares shall
not exceed the statutory minimum withholding requirements.  The amount of
any withholding tax not paid by  transfer or withholding of Shares shall be
paid to Motorola in cash.  The value of the Shares transferred or to be
withheld shall be based on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the
date that the amount of tax to be withheld shall be determined ("Tax Date")
or if Shares did not trade on the New York Stock Exchange on the Tax Date,
as of the last previous date Shares did so trade.  Each Election must be
made on or prior to the Tax Date.  The Committee may disapprove of any
Election, may suspend, condition, restrict or terminate the right to make
Elections, or may provide with respect to any Benefit that the right to
make Elections shall not apply to such Benefit.  An Election is
irrevocable, unless revocation is approved by the Committee.

     20.2     Compliance With Legal Requirements.  Anything in the Plan to
the contrary notwithstanding: (a) Motorola may, if it shall determine it
necessary or desirable for any reason, at the time of award of any Benefit
or the issuance of any Shares of Common Stock pursuant to any Benefit,
require the recipient of the Benefit, as a condition to the receipt thereof
or to the receipt of Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant thereto, to
deliver to Motorola a written representation of present intention to
acquire the Benefit or the Shares of Common Stock issued pursuant thereto
for his or her own account for investment and not for distribution; and (b)
if at any time Motorola further determines that the listing, registration
or qualification (or any updating of any such document) of any Benefit or
the Shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant thereto is necessary on any
securities exchange or under any federal or state securities or blue sky
law, or that the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body is
necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with the award
of any Benefit, the issuance of Shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto or
the removal of any restrictions imposed on such Shares, such Benefit shall
not be awarded or such Shares of Common Stock shall not be issued or such
restrictions shall not be removed, as the case may be, in whole or in part,
unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall
have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to
Motorola.  In addition, Motorola may terminate any Benefit or terminate,
withhold, condition, restrict or limit the issuance or delivery of any
Shares of Common Stock if it determines that such Benefit or the issuance
or delivery of Shares violates, or is prohibited or restricted or made
impractical or administratively burdensome by, any applicable laws, rules
or regulations, including but not limited to, those of any foreign
jurisdiction, stock exchange or Rule 16b-3.

     20.3     Leaves of Absence and Lay-Offs.  Except as provided in
Sections 4.5(a)(iii), 4.5(b)(v) and 4.5(d), whether a leave of absence or
lay-off shall constitute termination of employment for purposes of the Plan
or any Employee Stock Option or Benefit granted under and pursuant to the
Plan to Employees shall be determined by the Committee, in its sole
discretion, subject to then currently applicable law.  The Committee shall
adopt such rules, in its sole discretion, as to the time, any installment
limitations, restrictions and manner of the exercise or vesting of Benefits
held by Employees who are placed on leave of absence or lay-off status by
the Company or any Affiliate, except as provided in Sections 4.5(a)(iii),
4.5(b)(v) and 4.5(d).

     20.4     Indemnification and Exculpation.  Each person, who is or
shall have been a member of the Board or of the Committee, shall be
indemnified and held harmless by Motorola against and from any and all
loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with or resulting from any claim,
action, suit or proceeding to which such person may be a party or in which
such person may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act
under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by such person
in settlement thereof (with Motorola's written approval) or paid by such
person in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit, or
proceeding, except a judgment based upon a finding of such person's bad
faith, subject, however, to the condition that upon the institution of any
claim, action, suit or proceeding against such person, such person shall in
writing give Motorola an opportunity, at its own expense, to participate
in, and to the extent it may wish, to assume the defense thereof before
such person undertakes to handle it on such person's own behalf.  The
foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other
right to which such person may be entitled as a matter of law, under the
Delaware General Corporation Law, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
or By-Laws of Motorola or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have
to indemnify such person or hold such person harmless.  Each member of the
Board or of the Committee, and each officer and employee of Motorola shall
be fully justified in relying or acting upon any information furnished on
behalf of Motorola by any person or persons other than himself or herself
in connection with the administration of the Plan.  In no event shall any
person who is or shall have been a member of the Board or of the Committee,
or an officer or employee of Motorola, be liable for any determination made
or other action taken or any omission to act in reliance upon any such
information, or for any action taken (including the furnishing of
information) or any failure to act, if in good faith.

     20.5     Headings.  The headings of the sections and subsections of
the Plan are for convenience of reference only and shall not be used to
construe any provision of the Plan.

     20.6     Governing Law.  The Plan and all Agreements under it shall be
governed by, and construed and administered in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Illinois except to the extent that any federal law otherwise
controls.

     20.7     Employment Rights.  Nothing in the Plan or in any Agreement
or grant or award of any Benefit shall restrict the right of Motorola or
any Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any Participant at any time,
with or without cause, or to increase or decrease the compensation of any
Participant.

     20.8     Approval by Stockholders.  The Plan has been approved by the
Board of Directors and is subject to approval by the affirmative votes of
the holders of a majority of the Shares present, or represented, and
entitled to vote at the meeting of stockholders at which the Plan is
submitted.

     20.9     Implementation of the Plan and Grant of Employee Stock
Options Under 1996 Plan.  If this Plan is implemented pursuant to Section
20.8, except as herein provided, no further options will be granted under
the Share Option Plan of 1996.  If the Board of Directors terminates this
Plan after it has been implemented, stock options may be granted under the
Share Option Plan of 1996, but not as to any Shares issued or subject to
Benefits under this Plan.
