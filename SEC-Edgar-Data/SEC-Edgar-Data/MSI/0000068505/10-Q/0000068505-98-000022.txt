the three-month and six-month periods ended June 27, 1998 and June 28, 
1997, include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of 
normal recurring adjustments, reclassifications, and restructuring charges) 
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations 
and cash flows at June 27, 1998 and for all periods presented.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the 
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that 
these condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction 
with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto incorporated 
by reference in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 
1997.  The results of operations for the three-month and six-month periods 
ended June 27, 1998 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results 
to be expected for the full year.  Certain amounts have been reclassified 
in the 1997 financial statements to conform to the 1998 presentation.

5.  Reorganization of Businesses

In the second quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a pre-tax restructuring 
charge of $1.98 billion to cover: a reduction in employment by 
approximately 15,000 over the next 12 months from the approximate 150,000 
employees worldwide; the consolidation of manufacturing operations 
throughout the Company with emphasis on the Semiconductor Products and 
Messaging, Information and Media segments; the exit of additional non-
strategic, poorly performing businesses; and the writedown of assets which 
have become impaired either as a result of current business conditions or 
business portfolio decisions.

Throughout 1997, the Company established restructuring accruals totalling 
$327 million to exit its modem business in Huntsville, AL, to exit the 
MacOSr-compatible computer systems business, and to phase out participation 
in the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market.  At June 27, 1998, $256 
million of the accruals had been utilized with the remainder expected to be 
used by the end of 1998.

6.  Comprehensive Earnings(Loss)

SFAS No. 130 "Reporting Comprehensive Income", which is solely a financial 
statement presentation standard, requires the Company to disclose non-owner 
changes included in equity but not included in net earnings(loss).  These 
changes include the fair value adjustment to certain cost-based 
investments, foreign currency translation adjustments, and minimum pension 
liability adjustment.  Comprehensive earnings(loss) for the three-month 
periods ended June 27, 1998, and June 28, 1997, were $(1.4) billion and 
$567 million, respectively.  Comprehensive earnings(loss) for the six-month 
periods ended June 27, 1998, and June 28, 1997, were $(1.1) billion and 
$832 million, respectively.

7.  Recent Accounting Pronouncement

During the second quarter, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", 
which will be effective for the Company's fiscal year 2000.  This statement 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every 
derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments imbedded in 
other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or 
liability measured at its fair value.  The statement also requires that 
changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized in earnings unless 
specific hedge accounting criteria are met.  The Company is currently 
assessing the impact of this new statement on its consolidated financial 
position, liquidity, and results of operations.


                       Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                    Management's Discussion and Analysis
              of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Company's 
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and 
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and 
results of operations incorporated by reference in the Company's Form 
10-K for the year ended December 31, 1997.

Results of Operations:

In the second quarter of 1998, sales decreased 7 percent to $7.0 
billion from $7.5 billion a year earlier.  In the first half of 1998, 
sales declined 2 percent to $13.9 billion from $14.2 billion in the 
first half of 1997.

Excluding special items, second-quarter earnings were $6 million, or 
1 cent per share in 1998, compared with $392 million, or 64 cents per 
share in the second quarter of 1997.  Excluding special items, 
earnings for the six months were $147 million, or 25 cents per share, 
compared with $678 million, or $1.11 per share a year earlier.

The Company recorded special items of $1.91 billion pre-tax, or $2.23 
per share after-tax, in the second quarter of 1998.  These items 
include $1.98 billion of charges associated with a comprehensive 
series of manufacturing consolidations, cost reductions and 
restructuring steps intended to improve financial performance, as 
announced June 4, partially offset by gains on the sale of assets.  
As a result, the second-quarter loss, including the special items, 
was $1.3 billion, or $2.22 per share, compared with earnings of $268 
million, or 44 cents per share, in the second quarter a year ago.  
The year-earlier quarter includes special charges against pre-tax 
earnings of $190 million, or 20 cents per share after-tax, largely 
from the phase-out of the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) 
business.

In the first six months of 1998, the loss, including special items 
was $1.15 billion, or $1.92 per share, compared with earnings of $593 
million, or 97 cents per share, in last year's first half.

Cellular Products Segment sales declined 1 percent to $2.78 billion 
and orders were down 11 percent.  Excluding special items referred to 
earlier, the segment had a smaller operating profit than a year ago.  
Including special items, the segment had an operating loss versus a 
profit a year ago.

Cellular Subscriber Sector (CSS) sales and orders declined.  Sales 
and orders were higher in Europe, lower in Pan America and 
significantly lower in Asia.  Sales of digital products continued to 
increase versus last year.  This increase was entirely offset by a 
decline in sales of analog products, caused by a continuing trend of 
demand shift to digital products.

Cellular Infrastructure Group (CIG) sales increased while orders were 
significantly lower.  Sales were up significantly in Japan and Pan 
America, lower in Europe and significantly lower in Asia.  Orders 
were higher in Europe, lower in Asia and Pan America, and 
significantly lower in Japan than a year ago when an unusually high 
level of orders was recorded on a contract to build a nationwide Code 
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system.  The cellular infrastructure 
business has been historically characterized by large orders and 
irregular purchasing patterns, which can cause volatility in 
quarterly growth rates.

Semiconductor Products Segment sales decreased 11 percent to $1.81 
billion and orders were down 25 percent.  Excluding special items 
referred to earlier, the segment had an operating loss versus a 
profit a year ago.  Including special items, the segment had a larger 
operating loss than a year ago.  Orders were higher in the 
Transportation Systems Group, lower in the Consumer Systems and 
Networking and Computing Systems Groups, and significantly lower in 
the Wireless Subscriber Systems Group and Semiconductor Components 
Group.  All major regions posted lower orders with orders in Japan 
and Asia down significantly.  The semiconductor market continued to 
be adversely affected by economic difficulties in Asia, contributing 
to general market weakness and severe pricing pressures in many 
product lines.

Land Mobile Products Segment sales increased 18 percent to $1.37 
billion, orders rose 12 percent and operating profits increased.  
Orders for iDEN (Registered) equipment for integrated digital 
enhanced networks were up significantly, led by orders for 
infrastructure equipment in North America, Brazil, Colombia and 
Japan.  A new system in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and a second system in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina, began operations during the quarter.  A 900 
MHz dispatch-only system based on iDEN technology was announced and 
the first trial system was launched in Las Vegas, Nev.  The segment 
also won several contracts for TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) 
equipment.  TETRA is the only European-approved standard for digital 
trunked radio communications.  A contract in excess of $60 million 
was received from Dolphin Telecommunications for 150,000 radio 
handsets for use on its national network in the U.K.

Messaging, Information and Media Segment sales declined 32 percent to 
$771 million and orders were down 35 percent.  Excluding special 
items referred to earlier, the segment had a smaller operating profit 
than a year ago.  Including special items, the segment had an 
operating loss versus a profit a year ago.  Orders in the Paging 
Group were down significantly.  Sales and orders were lower in North 
America and significantly lower in China.  The Company announced the 
first commercial launch of the FLEX (Trademark) high speed, multi-
frequency roaming paging network in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous 
Region of China's nationwide paging network.  Orders and sales 
increased significantly in the emerging cable modem business.

Automotive, Component, Computer and Energy Sector sales declined 9 
percent and orders were down 15 percent.  Excluding special items 
referred to earlier, the sector had a smaller operating profit than a 
year ago.  Including special items, the sector had an operating loss 
versus a profit a year ago.  The sector's results are reported as 
part of the "Other Products" segment.

Space and Systems Technology Group Sales declined 36 percent, orders 
were 30 percent lower, and the group had an operating loss versus a 
profit a year ago.  The changes in sales, orders and operating 
profits are all largely attributable to the lower dollar value than a 
year ago of contractual milestones on the IRIDIUM (Registered) 
program.  Results are reported as part of the "Other Products" 
segment.

Initial deployment of the IRIDIUM global personal communications 
system was completed.  The total number of operational, on-orbit 
satellites is currently 65.  Motorola is planning 2 additional 
launches of Iridium satellites, carrying a total of 7 additional 
satellites, by the end of August.  Operational and voice quality 
testing of the system continued to be demonstrated successfully, and 
nine Iridium gateways achieved pre-commercial acceptance by gateway 
owners.  As previously reported, Iridium LLC may require additional 
financing, possibly during the second half of 1998, to continue to 
make contractual payments to the Company.

Manufacturing and other costs of sales were 71 percent of sales, 
compared with 67 percent in the second quarter of 1997.  Increased 
pricing pressures were experienced in several business segments and 
were due to a variety of factors including weakened Asian currencies 
and reduced demand.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 19 percent of sales 
compared with 17 percent in the year-earlier period, largely as a 
result of lower sales.
Depreciation expense decreased slightly as a percent of sales.  
Interest expense increased slightly as a percent of sales.  The tax 
rate for the second quarter was 30 percent versus a 35 percent tax 
rate a year ago.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

Operating activities used $267 million in cash for the six-month 
period ended June 27, 1998, as compared to providing $1.1 billion in 
cash for the six-month period ended June 28, 1997.  The use of cash 
was due primarily to lower earnings, increases in inventory for the 
first half of 1998, and recognition of the restructuring charge in 
the second quarter of 1998.

Inventories at June 27, 1998 increased by 7 percent or $287 million, 
compared to inventories at December 31, 1997.  Property, plant and 
equipment, less accumulated depreciation, increased $134 million 
since December 31, 1997.

The Company's notes payable and current portion of its long-term debt 
increased to $3.0 billion at June 27, 1998, from $1.3 billion at 
December 31, 1997.  Net debt (notes payable and current portion of 
long-term debt plus long-term debt less short-term investments and 
cash equivalents) to net debt plus equity increased to 24.5 percent 
at June 27, 1998 from 12.4 percent at December 31, 1997.  The 
Company's total domestic and foreign credit facilities aggregated 
$4.0 billion at June 27, 1998, of which $297 million were used and 
the remaining $3.7 billion were available to back up outstanding 
commercial paper which totaled $2.6 billion.

At June 27, 1998, the off-balance sheet commitment to Nextel 
Communications, Inc. for equipment financing remained at $485 
million.  This amount represents the maximum available commitment and 
may not be completely used.

As a multinational company, the Company's transactions are 
denominated in a variety of currencies.  The Company uses financial 
instruments to hedge, and therefore attempts to reduce, its overall 
exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows.  The 
Company's policy is to not speculate in financial instruments for 
profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation, trade in currencies 
for which there are no underlying exposures, or enter into trades for 
any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.  
Instruments used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk 
associated with the exposure being hedged and must be designated as a 
hedge at the inception of the contract.  Accordingly, changes in 
market values of hedge instruments must be highly correlated with 
changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception 
of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

The Company's strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues is to 
offset the gains or losses of the financial instruments against 
losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows or 
investments based on the operating business units' assessment of 
risk.  Currently, the Company primarily hedges firm commitments, 
including assets and liabilities currently on the balance sheet.  The 
Company expects that it may hedge anticipated transactions, 
forecasted transactions or investments in foreign subsidiaries in the 
future.

Almost all of the Company's non-functional currency receivables and 
payables which are denominated in major currencies that can be traded 
on open markets are hedged.  The Company uses forward contracts and 
options to hedge these currency exposures.  A portion of the 
Company's exposure is to currencies which are not traded on open 
markets, such as those in Latin America and China, and these are 
addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, through managing net 
asset positions, product pricing, and other means, such as component 
sourcing.

At June 27, 1998 and June 28, 1997, the Company had net outstanding 
foreign exchange contracts totaling $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion, 
respectively. The following schedule shows the five largest foreign 
exchange hedge positions as of June 27, 1998 and the corresponding 
positions at June 28, 1997:

Dollars in millions
Buy (Sell)              June 27,          June 28,
                          1998               1997   

Japanese Yen             (569)              (427)
British Pound Sterling   (405)              (356)
German Mark              (352)              (149)
Italian Lira             (177)              (129)
Malaysian Ringgit          69                  4

At June 27, 1998 and June 28, 1997, outstanding foreign exchange 
contracts primarily consisted of short-term forward contracts.  Net 
deferred gains at June 27, 1998, and net deferred losses at June 28, 
1997, on these forward contracts which hedge designated firm 
commitments were immaterial.

As of the end of the reporting period, the Company had no outstanding 
interest rate swaps, commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options 
relating to either its debt instruments or investments.  The Company 
does not have any derivatives to hedge the value of its equity 
investments in affiliated companies.

The Company's research and development expenditures were $722 million 
in the second quarter of 1998, compared with $678 million in the 
second quarter of 1997.  Research and development expenditures for 
the year ended December 31, 1997 were $2.7 billion.  The Company 
continues to believe that a strong commitment to research and 
development drives long-term growth.  The Company's capital 
expenditures for the second quarter of 1998 totaled $1.0 billion, 
compared with $611 million in the second quarter of 1997.  The 
Company is currently anticipating that fixed asset expenditures for 
1998 will be $3.5 billion.

Return on average invested capital (net earnings divided by the sum 
of stockholders' equity, long-term debt, notes payable and the 
current portion of long-term debt, less short-term investments and 
cash equivalents) was (3.8%) percent based on the performance of the 
four preceding fiscal quarters ending June 27, 1998, compared with 
7.4 percent based on the performance of the four preceding fiscal 
quarters ending June 28, 1997.  The Company's current ratio (the 
ratio of current assets to current liabilities) was 1.19 at June 27, 
1998, compared to 1.46 at December 31, 1997.

Year 2000:

The Company has been aggressively addressing "Year 2000" issues relating to 
the processing of date data at the turn of the century.  A company-wide 
task force has been formed, milestones have been established, and detailed 
plans are actively being implemented so that Motorola research programs, 
products and internal computer, financial, manufacturing and other 
infrastructure systems are reviewed and the necessary changes are 
addressed.

Additionally, Motorola customer and supplier relationships are being 
reviewed to assess and address Year 2000 issues. The Company has undertaken 
internal reviews and has contacted certain of its customers to assess, to 
the extent possible, Year 2000 issues related to Motorola products.  While 
the Company is taking all reasonable efforts to make information on the 
Year 2000 readiness of Motorola products available to its customers, this 
information may not reach all customers, particularly indirect purchasers.  
Although the Company believes that it can address Year 2000 readiness 
issues related to its products, there still may be disruptions and/or 
product failures that are unforeseen, particularly with respect to its 
infrastructure equipment.

Motorola is requesting assurances from its major suppliers that they are 
addressing this issue and that products procured by Motorola will function 
properly in the Year 2000. Certain critical suppliers, such as energy 
providers, have been unwilling to provide such assurances and do not expect 
to provide such assurances prior to the Year 2000.  Other critical 
suppliers do not expect to be able to provide such assurances until 1999.  
In both instances, this is particularly the case outside of the United 
States where the Company has significant operations.   In addition, many 
governmental agencies are not expected to be Year 2000 compliant.  As a 
result, it is difficult for the Company to assess the likelihood, or the 
impact on its business, of such entities' failure to be Year 2000 
compliant.

While Motorola's efforts to address Year 2000 issues will involve 
additional costs and the time and effort of a number of Motorola employees, 
the Company believes, based on currently available information, that it 
will be able to manage its total Year 2000 transition without any material 
adverse effect on the Company's future consolidated results of operations, 
liquidity and capital resources.

Euro Conversion:

On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European 
Union are scheduled to establish fixed conversion rates between their 
existing sovereign currencies and the euro.  The participating countries 
have agreed to adopt the euro as their common legal currency on that date. 

The Company has formed a task force and has begun to assess the potential 
impact to the Company that may result from the euro conversion.   In 
addition to tax and accounting considerations, the Company is assessing the 
potential impact from the euro conversion in a number of areas, including 
the following:  (1) the technical challenges to adapt information 
technology and other systems to accommodate euro-denominated transactions; 
(2) the competitive impact of cross-border price transparency, which may 
make it more difficult for businesses to charge different prices for the 
same products on a country-by-country basis; (3) the impact on currency 
exchange costs and currency exchange rate risk; and (4) the impact on 
existing contracts.

At this early stage of its assessment, the Company can not yet predict the 
anticipated impact of the euro conversion on the Company. 

Outlook:

Conditions in the whole semiconductor industry worldwide and general 
business conditions in Asia weakened further in the second quarter.  
The currency-related impact on pricing and consumer confidence 
continues to affect the Asian region and the Company.  Significant 
efforts to stabilize the region by the International Monetary Fund 
and various governments have not yet proven successful.  The negative 
impact on the Company's business is likely to continue for at least 
the remainder of the year.

To respond to the severity of these business conditions, the Company 
is resizing itself through aggressive restructuring steps announced 
last month.  These actions are intended to improve the Company's 
long-term profitability and efficiency.

The Company announced a more collaborative and market-focused 
Communications Enterprise that links together all of Motorola's 
communications businesses so they can easily share resources and 
cooperate on key business and technology issues.  At the same time, 
it will realign individual businesses so they can quickly and more 
efficiently direct the Company's diverse core competencies toward 
winning solutions, as the convergence of wireless technologies 
continues.  In the longer term, the Company expects to see the 
benefits of alliances and joint development projects in technologies 
ranging from digital signal processors to Internet Protocol 
telephony.  The Company has announced, and is pursuing additional, 
cooperative efforts to enable it to build on its software strengths 
and technology portfolio and to bring profitable new products to the 
marketplace ahead of the competition.  The Company believes these 
efforts, coupled with its strong position in emerging markets 
throughout the world, set the stage for a renewal of growth in sales 
and earnings.

Business Risks:

Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking and involve 
risks and uncertainties.  These include the statements in "Outlook" and 
statements about Iridium LLC's financing needs, the Company's 1998 fixed 
asset expenditures and the impact of Year 2000 issues.  Motorola wishes to 
caution the reader that the factors below and those in Motorola's 1998 
Proxy Statement on pages F-8 and F-9 and in its other SEC filings could 
cause Motorola's results to differ materially from those stated in the 
forward-looking statements.  These factors include: (i) the ability of 
Motorola to implement manufacturing consolidations, cost reductions and 
restructuring actions in a timely manner and the success of those efforts; 
(ii) the ability of the Company to integrate its businesses to reduce costs 
and increase efficiencies; (iii) unanticipated impact of the renewal plan 
on productivity and the ability of the company to retain, and where 
necessary recruit, employees; (iv) the success of efforts to stabilize 
economic conditions in Asia; (v) pricing pressures and demand for the 
company's products, particularly semiconductor and messaging products, 
especially in light of the current economic conditions in Asia; (vi) the 
potential that the impact of weakened currencies in Southeast Asia could 
spread to countries where Motorola does a sizable amount of business, 
including China and Japan; (vii) the potential that deteriorating economic 
conditions in Japan could continue or worsen; (viii) the ability of 
Motorola's cellular businesses to continue to transition to digital 
products and gain market share; (ix) product and technology development and 
commercialization risks, including for newer digital products, Iridiumr 
satellite deployment and software development and Iridium products; (x) 
steady growth in emerging markets; (xi) unanticipated changes in demand for 
products; (xii) continued weak demand for paging products in North America 
and China; and (xiii) unanticipated impact of Year 2000 issues, 
particularly the failure of products of major suppliers to function 
properly in the Year 2000.

Part II - Other Information


Item 1 - Legal Proceedings.

Motorola is a named defendant in seven cases arising out of alleged 
groundwater, soil and air pollution in Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona.  On 
June 1, 1998, acting with respect to that portion of the consolidated 
Lofgren personal injury cases that had been set for a June trial, and 
following extensive evidentiary hearings held in April and May, the Lofgren 
court ruled inadmissible proffered testimony from each of the plaintiffs' 
medical causation experts and granted summary judgment on those personal 
injury claims in favor of Motorola and the other remaining defendants.

Motorola has been a defendant in several cases arising out of its 
manufacture and sale of portable cellular telephones.  On June 30, 1998, 
the Illinois Appellate Court affirmed the Circuit Court's earlier dismissal 
of Schiffner v. Motorola, a purported class action by purchasers of 
portable cellular phones alleging economic losses.

See Item 3 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 
31, 1997 and Item 1 of Part II of the Company's Form 10-Q for the period 
ended March 28, 1998 for additional disclosures regarding pending matters.

In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial 
position, liquidity or results of operations of Motorola.

Item 2 - Changes in Securities.
Not applicable.

Item 3 - Defaults Upon Senior Securities.
Not applicable.

Item 4 - Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.
Not applicable.

Item 5 - Other Information.

the 1999 annual meeting of stockholders does not notify the Company of such 
proposal on or prior to February 6, 1999, then management proxies would be 
allowed to use their discretionary voting authority to vote on the proposal 
when the proposal is raised at the annual meeting, even though there is no 
discussion of the proposal in the 1999 proxy statement.

Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, proposals of stockholders intended to be 
presented at the Company's 1999 annual meeting of stockholders must be 
received by the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal 
executive offices not earlier than the 90th day prior to the date of the

                MOTOROLA EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED
                   (as amended through February 4, 1998)



1.    Purpose  

      The purpose of the Motorola Executive Incentive Plan, as Amended (the 
"Plan") is to provide special incentive and reward to Motorola employees 
who make substantial contributions to Motorola's success by their 
exceptional service.  

2.    Definitions

      For the purpose of the Plan, the following words and phrases, unless 
the context clearly indicates otherwise, shall have the following meanings:  

      a.  "Committee" shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board of 
Directors of Motorola, Inc. or any successor committee.

      b.  "Common Stock" shall mean Motorola, Inc. common stock, $3 par 
value.

      c.  "Company" shall mean Motorola, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

      d.  "Employee" shall mean any employee of the Company, including, but 
not limited to, the officers and directors who are employees of 
Motorola, Inc.

      e.  "Grantee" shall mean any person who is an Employee of the Company 
and has been or is eligible to be granted an award under the Plan.

      f.  "Restricted Stock" shall mean Shares issued under Section 6 of 
the Plan.

      g.  "Share" shall mean a share of Common Stock.

      h.  "Total and Permanent Disability" shall mean entitlement to 
disability benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act or 
under the Motorola Long Term Disability Benefit Plan or the 
determination by the Committee, in its reasonable discretion, that a 
Grantee is totally and permanently disabled."

3.    Reserve for the Plan; Shares

      The Company may, with respect to each fiscal year, commencing with 
the fiscal year ending December 31, 1977, set up a reserve for the purposes 
of the Plan, out of the Consolidated Net Earnings for such fiscal year, as 
hereinafter defined.  The amount of such reserve for each fiscal year shall 
be determined as follows:  a percentage not to exceed 7%, as may be 
determined by the Committee, of such Consolidated Net Earnings which 
remains after deducting therefrom an amount which (after allowing for 
United States federal, state and other nations' income taxes based on rates 
applicable to the income of the Company for such fiscal year) will equal 
five per centum (5%) of the Average Capital Employed for such fiscal year, 
as hereinafter defined.  

      The term "Capital Employed" shall mean the consolidated net worth as 
computed by Motorola, Inc. in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles but without the deduction for the current year's reserve for the 
Plan, plus long term debt (including the current portion thereof) plus 
short term debt, less marketable securities, all as they may be classified 
as such under generally accepted accounting principles on the same basis as 
employed in preparation of the Company's audited and published financial 
statements.  

      The term "Average Capital Employed" for any fiscal year shall mean 
the total of Capital Employed at the beginning of each fiscal month of such 
fiscal year plus the Capital Employed at the end of the last fiscal month 
of such fiscal year divided by the number of fiscal months included therein 
plus 1.  

      The term "Consolidated Net Earnings" for the fiscal year shall mean 
the consolidated net earnings or profits of the Company, computed in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The Consolidated 
Net Earnings shall be adjusted so that there shall be no deductions for (a) 
the reserve for the Plan, (b) the amount of United States federal, state 
and other nations' income taxes of the Company with respect to such fiscal 
year or (c) any extraordinary charge against the consolidated net earnings 
or profits of the Company, as determined by the Committee or its designee.  
The Company, however, in computing Consolidated Net Earnings shall make a 
deduction for amounts paid by the Company under Social Security and other 
laws having similar purposes.  The Company, likewise, shall make deductions 
of such amounts as are required under generally accepted standard 
accounting practices for the purpose of setting up reserves for losses on 
accounts and notes receivable, depreciation and maintenance or for any 
other purposes provided such reserves are of the type established in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and reflected in 
the Company's audited and published financial statements.  In computing the 
Consolidated Net Earnings and the Average Capital Employed in respect of 
any fiscal year for the purpose of the reserve for the Plan, the Board of 
Directors, the Committee and officers of Motorola, Inc. shall be entitled 
to rely conclusively upon the computation of Consolidated Net Earnings and 
Average Capital Employed as prepared and certified by a firm of independent 
certified public accountants selected by the Board of Directors of 
Motorola, Inc. for that purpose, which accountants may be the firm of 
independent certified public accountants employed by Motorola, Inc. for any 
other purposes, and such determination when made by independent certified 
public accountants, as aforesaid, shall be binding upon all persons.  

      Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to obligate the Company to set 
up any reserve for the Plan unless the Consolidated Net Earnings for the 
fiscal year in question shall suffice therefor.  

      In the event that the Consolidated Net Earnings with respect to a 
fiscal year shall not be sufficient to permit any reserve for the Plan, the 
failure of the Company to set up a reserve for the Plan for such fiscal 
year shall not be deemed to effect the termination of the Plan.  

      The Committee may in its sole and absolute discretion exclude the net 
worth and net profit or loss of any subsidiary and/or affiliate in the 
calculation of Average Capital Employed and Consolidated Net Earnings as 
provided aforesaid.  

      Awards payable in Shares of Common Stock or Shares of Restricted 
Stock, or a combination thereof, shall be paid from Shares reserved or 
available for issuance under the Motorola Incentive Plan of 1998.
	
4.    The Committee

      The Committee shall have full power and authority to construe, 
interpret, and administer the Plan, and each decision of the Committee 
shall be final, conclusive, and binding upon all persons.  Likewise, the 
Committee shall have full discretion with respect to the determination of 
each award.  The Committee may grant awards which total the amount 
available in the reserve for the Plan as determined by the independent 
certified public accountants, plus the aggregate of (i) any part of the 
reserve for prior years which is not awarded and which the Committee has 
returned to the reserve, (ii) any unpaid portions of installments or 
deferred payments forfeited and (iii) any reserves established and 
accumulated but not awarded under the Plan from its adoption in 1968 up to 
the date the Plan, as Amended, becomes effective, but the Committee shall 
not be obliged to award the full amount so available to be awarded.  
Recommendations for awards shall be made to the Committee by the Chairman 
of the Board of Directors, by the Chief Executive Officer, by the President 
and Chief Operating Officer, by the officers of Motorola, Inc. under such 
procedures as may be prescribed by the Committee from time to time.  Any 
part of the reserve for the Plan that is not allocated to individual 
Employees of the Company may, in the discretion of the Committee, be 
returned to earnings or retained in the reserve for the Plan to be used for 
future awards to Employees of the Company.  

      At the beginning of each fiscal year the Committee shall determine 
which of the Company's key Employees will make substantial contributions to 
the Company's success by their exceptional service and therefore 
participate in the Plan.  The Committee may grant awards from the reserve 
for the Plan to such other Employees as the Committee in its sole and 
absolute discretion shall select.  A person whose employment terminates 
during the year or who is granted a leave of absence during the year may, 
at the discretion of the Committee and under such rules as the Committee 
may from time to time prescribe, receive an award.

5.    Payment of Awards

      Until the awards are paid to the Grantees as herein provided, the 
unpaid awards shall be retained by the Company (without liability for 
interest, unless interest is provided for by the Committee in accordance 
with the provisions of this Section 5).  Awards shall be paid in cash, in 
Shares of Common Stock, in Shares of Restricted Stock or in a combination 
of the foregoing, as elected by the Grantee.  Such election (a) shall be in 
writing, (b) shall specify a percentage or dollar amount to be paid in 
cash, in Common Stock and/or in Restricted Stock, (c) shall be made prior 
to the date the award is paid and (d) shall become effective on the date of 
receipt by the Company; provided, however, an election to receive payment 
in Shares of Common Stock or Shares of Restricted Stock or a combination 
thereof, shall be contingent upon approval thereof, in whole or in part, by 
the Committee or its designee in its sole discretion, and to the extent not 
approved, payment shall be made in cash, and provided further, if the 
Committee or its designee determines that payment in Shares of Common Stock 
or Shares of Restricted Stock violates, or is prohibited or restricted or 
made impractical or administratively burdensome by, any applicable law, 
rule or regulation, the  award shall be paid in cash.  The number of Shares 
payable with respect to an award payable in Shares shall be determined by 
using the average of the high and low sale prices per Share of Motorola 
Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange - Composite 
Transactions on the day the award is made or if Shares of Common Stock did 
not trade on the New York Stock Exchange on that day, on the last previous 
day on which Shares of Common Stock did so trade.  The Committee may, in 
order to more fully implement the purpose of the Plan, provide that any or 
all cash awards shall be paid (a) in full at the time of the cash award, 
(b) in installments, (c) on a deferred basis, in whole or in part, until 
some future date or dates specified by the Committee or (d) upon the 
written request of a Grantee, on a deferred basis, in whole or in part, 
until some future date or dates specified in the request and agreed to by 
the Committee; provided however, that with respect to cash awards deferred 
at the request of a Grantee as to any year, such request for deferral shall 
be irrevocable as to such year, and provided further, that such irrevocable 
written request must be received by the Committee on or before December 31 
of the year for which the cash award is payable.  With respect to cash 
awards not payable in full at the time of the award, the Committee shall 
have full power and authority in its sole discretion to set all terms and 
conditions relating thereto, including, but not limited to (i) the payment 
date or dates if payment of the cash award is deferred by the Committee 
under (c) above or if the cash award is payable in installments and (ii) 
the forfeiture provisions, if any, which shall apply to cash awards 
deferred by the Committee under (c) above - it being the intent that the 
forfeiture provisions contained in this Section 5 shall not apply to cash 
awards deferred by the Committee under (c) above unless the Committee 
expressly provides for their applicability as a term or condition of the 
deferral and then they shall apply only to the extent so provided.  The 
Committee shall also have the power and authority to provide forfeiture 
provisions with respect to cash awards it defers under (c) above which are 
different from those contained in this Section 5 and forfeiture provisions 
with respect to cash awards payable in installments or deferred at the 
request of a participant which are additional to those contained in this 
Section 5.  As to cash awards not payable in full at the time of the  
award, the Committee may impose such terms, conditions, restrictions and 
forfeitures with respect thereto as it shall determine to be in the best 
interests of the Company and to effect the purposes of the Plan.  The 
Committee may provide that interest shall be paid out of the reserve on the 
amount of any cash award payable in installments under (b) above, or 
deferred in whole or in part by the Committee under (c) above, or deferred 
in whole or in part at the request of any Grantee with the agreement of the 
Committee under (d) above.  If the Committee provides for the payment of 
interest with respect to any such cash award, such interest shall be 
accrued as of the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company, shall be 
credited to an account which shall be established by the Company in the 
name of the Grantee and shall be compounded as of the end of each such 
fiscal quarter.  Accumulated interest shall be distributed to the Grantee 
at the time or times the cash award is paid out.  In the case of cash 
awards payable in installments and deferred cash awards which are not paid 
out in a single sum, the interest to be distributed shall be proportionate 
to the amount of the cash award being paid at the time.  The rate of 
interest to be paid shall be set by the Committee at the time of the grant 
of the cash award to which it relates.  The Committee is authorized to 
change the rate of interest at any time and to set different rates for 
different Grantees and for differing circumstances.  

      If the Committee shall determine that the actions or conduct of a 
Grantee have been in any manner adverse, or in any way contrary, to the 
best interests of the Company, such Grantee shall lose any right to receive 
any portion of any installment, or deferred payment, or amount that would 
otherwise have been paid subsequent to the first of the month in which such 
act or conduct first occurred, provided, however, that in no case shall the 
Grantee lose the right to be paid the Grantee's unpaid cash awards or cash 
award, as the case may be, as of a date prior to January 1 of the year in 
which the determination resulting in such loss of right is made, and 
provided further, that no installment, deferred payment or amount delivered 
or paid prior to the date of such determination shall be required to be 
returned.  The determination as to whether any act or conduct of a Grantee 
is adverse or in any way contrary to the best interests of the Company 
shall be made by the Committee under such procedure as may from time to 
time be prescribed by the Committee and shall be made in the absolute 
discretion of the Committee.  Any determination so made, including any 
determination of the time at which such act or conduct first occurred, 
shall be conclusive. The provisions relating to forfeiture contained in 
this subparagraph shall not apply to cash awards deferred by the Committee 
under clause (c) in the first subparagraph of this Section 5 unless and to 
the extent specifically made applicable by the Committee.  

      A Grantee whose employment terminates by dismissal for cause, as 
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, or who voluntarily 
terminates employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall, 
unless otherwise determined by the Committee in connection with such 
termination of employment, lose any right to receive any unpaid 
installments or deferred payments.  A Grantee whose employment terminates 
for any reason other than by death or as set forth in the preceding 
sentence shall, unless otherwise determined in connection with the 
termination of the Grantee's employment, continue to be paid any unpaid 
installments or deferred payments in the same manner as though the 
Grantee's employment had continued without interruption until such cash 
awards are fully paid.  The provisions relating to forfeiture contained in 
this subparagraph shall not apply to cash awards deferred by the Committee 
under clause (c) in the first subparagraph of this Section 5 unless and to 
the extent specifically made applicable by the Committee.  

      If it shall be determined by the Committee that a Grantee who was 
permitted to retain the right to receive any unpaid installments or 
deferred payments upon termination of employment has, after such 
termination of employment, engaged, directly or indirectly, in any activity 
which is in competition with any activity of the Company or whose actions 
or conduct, either prior to or after such termination of employment, has 
been in any manner adverse or in any way contrary to the best interests of 
the Company, such Grantee shall, unless otherwise determined, lose any 
right to receive any unpaid installments or deferred payments as of the 
first of the month in which such competitive activity or such act or 
conduct first occurred, provided, however, that in no case shall the 
Grantee lose the right to receive any unpaid installments or deferred 
payments as of a date prior to January 1 of the year in which the 
determination resulting in such loss of right is made, and provided 
further, that no installment or amount delivered or paid prior to the date 
of any such determination shall be required to be returned.  Each 
determination provided for in this subparagraph shall be made by the 
Committee under such procedure as may from time to time be prescribed by 
the Committee and shall be made in the absolute discretion of the 
Committee.  Any determination so made, including any determination of the 
time at which such competitive activity or such act or conduct first 
occurred, shall be conclusive.  The provisions relating to forfeiture 
contained in this subparagraph shall not apply to cash awards deferred by 
the Committee under clause (c) in the first subparagraph of this Section 5 
unless and to the extent specifically made applicable by the Committee.  

      A Grantee who loses the right to be paid any unpaid installments or 
deferred payments shall receive forthwith all portions of such Grantee's 
cash awards, unpaid but earned installments or deferred payments not 
otherwise forfeited in accordance with this Section 5.  The unpaid portions 
of installments or deferred payments which are forfeited shall be credited 
to the reserve for the Plan.  

      If a Grantee dies, the Grantee's unpaid and undelivered cash awards 
shall be paid and delivered to the beneficiary previously designated by 
such Grantee in writing, or, if such Grantee did not designate any 
beneficiary in writing or if all of the Grantee's designated beneficiaries 
predeceased the Grantee, to the Grantee's legal representative at such time 
and in such manner as if such Grantee were living and in service with the 
Company unless the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion 
accelerates such payment and delivery.  

6.    Awards Paid in Restricted Stock

      Restricted Stock consists of Shares of Common Stock which are subject 
to a substantial risk of forfeiture and to restrictions on their sale or 
other transfer by the Grantee.  The Committee shall determine the time or 
times within which Shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to 
forfeiture, the time or times at which the restrictions will terminate and 
all other terms and conditions relating to the Restricted Stock.  A Grantee 
who receives Restricted Stock shall execute and deliver to Motorola an 
agreement evidencing the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to 
such Restricted Stock.  A Grantee who receives Restricted Stock may be 
issued a stock certificate in respect of such Shares of Restricted Stock.  
Such certificate, if issued, shall be registered in the name of such 
Grantee, and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, 
conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Shares.  The Committee may 
require that the stock certificates evidencing such Shares be held in 
escrow by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have terminated, 
and that, as a condition to delivery of any Restricted Stock certificate, 
the Grantee shall have delivered to the Company a stock power, endorsed in 
blank, relating to such Restricted Stock certificate.

      All Shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to such restrictions 
and conditions as the Committee may determine, including, but not limited 
to, any or all of the following restrictions and conditions:

      (a)   a prohibition against the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or 
encumbrance of the Shares of Restricted Stock, such prohibition to 
terminate at such time or times (including the passage of time only) 
as the Committee shall determine, whether in installments or 
otherwise, or at the time of death, Total and Permanent Disability or 
retirement, or based on service, of the holder of such Shares, or 
otherwise as the Committee may provide;

(b) a provision that the holder of Shares of Restricted Stock 
forfeit all or part of such Shares in the event of termination of his 
or her employment for any reason other than death, Total and 
Permanent Disability or retirement during any period in which such 
Shares are subject to restrictions; or a provision vesting such 
Shares in the event of termination of employment; or

      (c)   a provision that the holder of Shares of Restricted Stock 
forfeit such Shares in the event the Grantee engages, directly or 
indirectly, in any activity which is in competition with any activity 
of the Company or any subsidiary or in any action or conduct which is 
in any manner adverse or in any way contrary to the interests of the 
Company or any subsidiary unless otherwise determined by the 
Committee.  The determination of whether a Grantee is or has engaged 
in any competitive activity or in any action or conduct which is 
adverse or contrary to the interests of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries shall be made by the Committee, and such determination 
shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties.

      The Committee shall have the right at any time to accelerate, reduce 
or terminate any restrictions, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.

      Promptly after the termination of the restrictions, by lapse of time 
or otherwise, without a prior forfeiture, with respect to Shares of 
Restricted Stock, a certificate for such Shares shall be delivered free of 
all restrictions and legends together with deferred dividends, if any, to 
the Grantee or to the Grantee's legal representative, beneficiary or heir.  
If a stock certificate was previously delivered to the Grantee, the 
replacement certificate will not be delivered to the Grantee until the 
previously delivered certificate is returned to the Company in a form 
acceptable for transfer, free and clear of all liens, claims and 
encumbrances.

      Subject to the applicable restrictions, the Grantee may be given, 
with respect to the Shares of Restricted Stock, any or all rights of a 
stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the Shares, and the 
right to receive any cash or stock dividends.  The Committee, in its sole 
discretion, as determined at the time of the award, may permit or require 
the payment of cash dividends to be deferred and, if the Committee so 
determines, reinvested in additional Restricted Stock or otherwise be 
reinvested.  The Committee may require that stock dividends issued with 
respect to Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of 
Restricted Stock that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms 
and conditions that apply to the Shares with respect to which such 
dividends are issued.

7.    Change in Control

      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 or any of the eligibility 
requirements of the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control, all Grantees 
on the date of the Change in Control shall have a fully vested and 
nonforfeitable right to receive all amounts of all cash awards which remain 
payable under clause (b) of the first subparagraph of Section 5 or which 
were previously deferred under clauses (c) or (d) of the first subparagraph 
of Section 5, and no amendment, suspension, curtailment or termination of 
the Plan shall adversely affect or terminate such vested and nonforfeitable 
right to receive any cash award granted under the Plan.  

      Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the restrictions on all 
Shares of Restricted Stock outstanding on the date on which the Change in 
Control occurs shall be automatically terminated and each Grantee holding 
Restricted Stock shall have the right to receive unrestricted Shares in 
substitution for the Shares of Restricted Stock or, at his or her election 
made during a period of sixty (60) days following the date on which the 
Change in Control occurs, the right to have the Company purchase any or all 
Shares of Restricted Stock for an immediate lump sum cash payment equal to 
the product of (1) the higher of (i) the average of the high and low sale 
prices of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange - 
Composite Transactions on the date of payment, or if Shares did not trade 
on such date, on the last previous day on which Shares traded prior to such 
date, or (ii) the highest per Share price for Common Stock actually paid in 
connection with the Change in Control and (2) the number of Shares of such 
Restricted Stock.

      For purposes of the Plan, a "Change in Control" shall mean a Change 
in Control of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to 
Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act") whether or not 
the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, 
without limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have 
occurred if (A) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Section 
13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" 
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, 
of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the combined 
voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (other than the 
Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company, any "person" who is a 
natural person and was shown as the "beneficial owner", directly or 
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 5% of the 
combined voting power of the Company's securities in the Company's Proxy 
Statement dated earlier than, but closest to, the date of this amendment of 
the Plan; and, for purposes of the Plan, no Change in Control shall be 
deemed to have occurred as a result of the "beneficial ownership," or 
changes therein, of the Company's securities by any of the foregoing), (B) 
there shall be consummated (i) any consolidation or merger of the Company 
in which the Company is not the surviving or continuing corporation or 
pursuant to which shares of the Company's Common Stock would be converted 
into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the Company 
in which the holders of the Company's Common Stock immediately prior to the 
merger have (directly or indirectly) at least an 80% ownership interest in 
the outstanding Common Stock of the surviving corporation immediately after 
the merger, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one 
transaction or a series of related transactions) of all, or substantially 
all, of the assets of the Company, (C) the stockholders of the Company 
approve any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the 
Company, or (D) as a result of, or in connection with, any cash tender 
offer, exchange offer, merger or other business combination, sale of 
assets, proxy or consent solicitation (other than by the Board of Directors 
of the Company), contested election or substantial stock accumulation (a 
"Control Transaction"), the members of the Board immediately prior to the 
first public announcement relating to such Control Transaction shall 
thereafter cease to constitute a majority of the Board.  

      Furthermore, in the event a Grantee's employment with the Company 
terminates within one year of a Change in Control, that Grantee shall 
receive an award from the reserve for the year in which the Grantee's 
employment is terminated.  Such award shall be prorated from the first day 
of the fiscal year in which the Grantee's employment is terminated up to 
the date of termination of employment.  This pro rata share of the award 
shall be paid within thirty days after the date on which the Grantee's 
employment is terminated.  

      A Grantee shall be entitled to a pro rata award if his or her 
employment with the Company is terminated for any reason (including 
disability or retirement) except:  (a) when the relevant Change in Control 
occurs as a result of a transaction or transactions initiated by the 
Company, other than a transaction or transactions initiated by the Company 
in response to or otherwise in connection with an unsolicited proposal to 
the Company which would result in a Change in Control, or (b) the Company 
involuntarily terminates the Grantee's employment with the Company or a 
subsidiary of the Company for good cause.  For purposes of the Plan, "good 
cause" means (a) the conviction of a Grantee of any criminal violation 
involving dishonesty, fraud or breach of trust, or (b) the Grantee's 
willful engagement in gross misconduct in the performance of his or her 
duties that materially injures the Company.  

8.    Amount of Individual Awards

      The Committee shall make the sole determination of the amount of the 
awards to be made under the Plan, provided, that the aggregate amount of 
all awards made under the Plan does not exceed the aggregate amount in the 
reserve.

9.    Nature of Grantee's Rights Under The Plan

      Neither the adoption of the Plan, nor any modification hereof, nor 
any payment hereunder, shall be construed as giving to the Grantee or any 
person whomsoever any legal or equitable rights against the Company or its 
officers or directors or as giving any Grantee the right to be retained in 
the service of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  No loan shall be 
made to any Grantee by the Company because one or more payments might be 
made to the Grantee under the Plan.  No Grantee shall have any right to 
assign, transfer, appropriate, encumber, commute or anticipate any payment 
that might be made to the Grantee under the Plan, and no benefits, rights 
or interest of a Grantee under the Plan shall in any way be subject to any 
legal process to levy upon, garnishee or attach the same for payment of any 
claim against the Grantee, nor shall any Grantee have any right of any kind 
whatsoever under the Plan other than the right to receive any payment as 
and when it is due and payable under the terms of the Plan.  

10.   Administration of the Plan

      The Committee shall keep and maintain records and accounts which will 
accurately disclose at all times the reserve for the Plan, if any, for each 
year during which the Plan is in effect, the awards made by the Committee 
under the Plan, the payment or other disposition of these awards, and any 
other pertinent information with respect to the activities of the 
Committee.  

      The fiscal year of the Plan shall at all times be the same as the 
fiscal year of the Company.  

      The Committee may consult with counsel, who may be of counsel to the 
Company, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good 
faith in reliance upon the advice of such counsel.  

      The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company 
and shall not be charged against the reserve for the Plan, if any.  

11.   Indemnification and Exculpation

      Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Board of 
Directors of the Company or of the Committee shall be indemnified and held 
harmless by the Company against and from any and all loss, cost, liability 
or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such person 
in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit or proceeding 
to which such person may be a party or in which such person may be involved 
by reason of any action taken or failure to act under the Plan and against 
and from any and all amounts paid by such person in settlement thereof 
(with the Company's written approval) or paid by such person in 
satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except a 
judgment based upon a finding of such person's bad faith, subject, however, 
to the condition that upon the institution of any claim, action, suit or 
proceeding against such person, such person shall in writing give the 
Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to participate in, and to the 
extent it may wish, to assume the defense thereof before such person 
undertakes to handle it on such person's own behalf.  The foregoing right 
of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other right to which such 
person may be entitled as a matter of law or otherwise, or any power that 
the Company may have to indemnify such person or hold such person harmless.  

      Each member of the Board of Directors of the Company or of the 
Committee, and each officer and employee of the Company shall be fully 
justified in relying or acting upon any information furnished on behalf of 
the Company by any person or persons other than himself or herself in 
connection with the administration of the Plan.  In no event shall any 
person who is or shall have been a member of the Board of Directors of the 
Company or of the Committee, or any officer or employee of the Company, be 
liable for any determination made or other action taken or any omission to 
act in reliance upon any such information, or for any action (including the 
furnishing of information) taken or any failure to act, if in good faith.  

12.   Amendment of the Plan

      The Plan may be amended from time to time by the Board of Directors 
of the Company or the Committee and may be terminated at any time by the 
Board of Directors of the Company.

                   (as amended through February 4, 1998)
             (Approved by Motorola stockholders on May 3, 1994)


1.    Name of the Plan and Plan Objectives

       The name of the Plan is the Motorola Long Range Incentive Plan of 
1994 (the "Plan").  The objectives of the Plan are:

a.     To increase the value of the stockholders' investment in 
Motorola, Inc. common stock through the achievement of outstanding 
corporate performance; 
	
b.     To reward participating executives for the Company's achieving 
outstanding performance, based on pre-established objective 
performance standards, over extended periods;

c.     To provide long term incentives in addition to the short term 
incentives of the Motorola Executive Incentive Plan, as amended; and

d.     To enhance the Company's ability to retain participating 
executives. 		

2.    Definitions

      For the purpose of the Plan, the following words and phrases, unless 
the context clearly indicates otherwise, shall have the following meanings:

a.     "Committee" shall mean the Compensation Committee of the Board 
of Directors of Motorola, Inc. or any successor committee.
	
b.     "Common Stock" shall mean Motorola, Inc. common stock, $3 par

years of the Company.

3.    Stockholder Approval

      Awards, if any, granted under the Plan are contingent on receiving 
approval of the Plan by the stockholders of the Company, by a majority of 
the shares voting at a meeting of the stockholders, prior to payment of 
awards, if any.

4.    Cash Reserve; Shares

      The Company may, with respect to each Cycle, set up a cash reserve 
for the purpose of the Plan in such amount as may be determined by the 
Company in its sole discretion.  Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to 
obligate the Company to set up a cash reserve for the Plan.  The failure of 
the Company to set up a cash reserve for the Plan in any given year shall 
not be deemed to effect termination of the Plan.  Awards payable in Shares 
of Common Stock or Shares of Restricted Stock shall be paid from Shares 
reserved or available for issuance under the Motorola Incentive Plan of 
1998.

5.    Committee

      The Committee shall have full power and authority to construe, 
interpret and administer the Plan, and each decision of the Committee shall 
be final, conclusive and binding upon all persons.

      At the beginning of each Cycle, the Committee shall determine (1) 
which of the Company's Eligible Employees are in positions in which they 
are likely to make substantial long term contributions to the Company's 
success and therefore participate in the Plan for the Cycle, and (2) which 
award level category each participant is assigned to.

      After the close of each Cycle, the Committee shall determine and 
certify the extent to which the performance  measures/metrics and other 
terms and conditions, if any, relating to the achievement of the 
performance measures /metrics were satisfied.

 6.   Comparator Companies and Performance Measures/Metrics

      At the beginning of each Cycle, the Committee shall determine the 
comparator companies (Exhibit A) to be used in comparing performance and 
the objective measures/metrics for the Cycle.  The measures/metrics to be 
used for this purpose shall be Return on Net Assets, Shareholder Return, 
Sales Growth and Fundable Growth (Exhibits B and C), each of which shall be 
weighted 25%.

      In the event that the financial reports of one or more of the 
comparator companies is not published for one or more years of a Cycle, 
such company or companies shall be excluded from the calculations of 
comparator company performance for such Cycle.

7.    Award Level Categories, Maximum Awards and Calculation of Awards

      Each participant shall be assigned by the Committee to one of the 
following categories, with the associated maximum award, at the beginning 
of each Cycle:

              Award Level                Maximum Award As Percent
               Category                 Of Annualized Base Salary
                  A                               200%
                  B                               150
                  C                               100	
  		       	
      The Company's actual performance for the Cycle in relation to the 
objective performance measures/metrics shall determine the percent of the 
maximum award to be paid to each Grantee. This percent shall be multiplied 
by the maximum award for each Grantee (i.e., 200%, 150% and 100% for award 
level categories A, B and C, respectively) to calculate the award, as a 
percent of annualized base salary, to be paid to each Grantee.  For the 
purpose of computing the maximum dollar amount of the award for each 
Grantee, the lesser of (1) 125% of annualized base salary on January 1 of 
the first year of the Cycle, or (2) 100% of annualized base salary on 
December 31 of the last year of the Cycle, shall be used. The maximum 
dollar amount of the award for any Grantee for any Cycle shall not exceed 
$5 million.

8.    Payment of Awards  

      After performance has been determined by the Committee, awards, if 
any, shall be paid (i) one-half (1/2) in cash and (ii) one-half (1/2) in 
either Shares of Common Stock or Shares of Restricted Stock, as elected by 
the Grantee; provided, however, if the Committee determines that payment in 
Shares of Common Stock or Shares of Restricted Stock violates, or is 
prohibited or restricted or made impractical or administratively burdensome 
by, any applicable law, rule or regulation, the award shall be paid in 
cash.  Such election (a) shall be in writing, (b) shall be made prior to 
the date the award is paid and (c) shall become effective on the date of 
receipt by the Company.  The number of Shares payable with respect to an 
award payable in Shares shall be determined by using the average of the 
high and low sale prices per Share of Motorola Common Stock as reported on 
the New York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions on the day the award 
is made or if Shares of Common Stock did not trade on the New York Stock 
Exchange on that day, on the last previous day on which Shares of Common 
Stock did so trade.  Until the awards are paid to the Grantees as herein 
provided, the unpaid awards shall be retained by the Company (without 
liability for interest, unless interest is provided for by the Committee in 
accordance with the provisions of this Section 8).  Awards shall be payable 
in full promptly after the time the performance has been determined by the 
Committee, provided that the Committee may specify that cash awards shall 
be paid (a) in installments, (b) on a deferred basis, in whole or in part, 
until some future date or dates specified by the Committee or (c) upon the 
written request of a Grantee, on a deferred basis, in whole or in part, 
until some future date or dates specified in the request and agreed to by 
the Committee; provided, however, that with respect to cash awards deferred 
at the request of a Grantee as to any Cycle, such request for deferral 
shall be irrevocable as to such Cycle, and provided further, that such 
irrevocable written request must be received by the Committee on or before 
December 31 of the last year of the Cycle for which the cash award is 
payable.  With respect to cash awards not payable in full at the time of 
the cash award, the Committee shall have full power and authority in its 
sole discretion to set all terms and conditions relating thereto, 
including, but not limited to (i) the payment date or dates if payment of 
the cash award is deferred by the Committee under (b) above or if the cash 
award is payable in installments and (ii) the forfeiture provisions, if 
any, which shall apply to cash awards deferred by the Committee under (b) 
above - it being the intent that the forfeiture provisions contained in 
this Section 8 shall not apply to cash awards deferred by the Committee 
under (b) above unless the Committee expressly provides for their 
applicability as a term or condition of the deferral and then they shall 
apply only to the extent so provided.  The Committee shall also have the 
power and authority to provide forfeiture provisions with respect to cash 
awards it defers under (b) above which are different from those contained 
in this Section 8 and forfeiture provisions with respect to cash awards 
payable in installments or deferred at the request of a participant which 
are additional to those contained in this Section 8.  As to cash awards not 
payable in full at the time of the cash award, the Committee may impose 
such terms, conditions, restrictions and forfeitures with respect thereto 
as it shall determine to be in the best interests of the Company and to 
effect the purposes of the Plan. The Committee may provide that interest 
shall be paid out of the reserve, if any, or by the Company, on the amount 
of any cash award payable in installments under (a) above, or deferred in 
whole or in part by the Committee under (b) above, or deferred in whole or 
in part at the request of any Grantee with the agreement of the Committee 
under (c) above.  If the Committee provides for the payment of interest 
with respect to any such cash award, such interest shall be accrued as of 
the last day of each fiscal quarter of the Company, shall be credited to an 
account which shall be established by the Company in the name of the 
Grantee and shall be compounded as of the end of each such fiscal quarter.  
Accumulated interest shall be distributed to the Grantee at the time or 
times the cash award is paid out.  In the case of cash awards payable in 
installments and deferred cash awards which are not paid out in a single 
sum, the interest to be distributed shall be proportionate to the amount of 
the cash award being paid at the time.  The rate of interest to be paid 
shall be set by the Committee at the time of the grant of the cash award to 
which it relates.  The Committee is authorized to change the rate of 
interest at any time and to set different rates for different Grantees and 
for differing circumstances.  

      If the Committee shall determine that the actions or conduct of a 
Grantee have been in a manner adverse, or in any way contrary, to the best 
interests of the Company, such Grantee shall lose any right to receive any 
portion of any installment, or deferred payment, or amount that would 
otherwise have been paid subsequent to the first of the month in which such 
act or conduct first occurred, provided, however, that in no case shall the 
Grantee lose the right to be paid the Grantee's unpaid cash awards or cash 
award, as the case may be, as of a date prior to January 1 of the year in 
which the determination resulting in such loss of right is made, and 
provided further, that no installment, deferred payment or amount delivered 
or paid prior to the date of such determination shall be required to be 
returned.  The determination as to whether any act or conduct of a Grantee 
is adverse, or in any way contrary, to the best interests of the Company 
shall be made by the Committee under such procedure as may from time to 
time be prescribed by the Committee and shall be made in the absolute 
discretion of the Committee.  Any determination so made, including any 
determination of the time at which such act or conduct first occurred, 
shall be conclusive.  The provisions relating to forfeiture contained in 
this subparagraph shall not apply to cash awards deferred by the Committee 
under clause (b) in the first subparagraph of this Section 8 unless and to 
the extent specifically made applicable by the Committee.  

      A Grantee whose employment terminates by dismissal for cause, as 
determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, or who voluntarily 
terminates employment with the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall, 
unless otherwise determined by the Committee in connection with such 
termination of employment, lose any right to receive any unpaid 
installments or deferred payments.  A Grantee whose employment terminates 
for any reason other than by death or as set forth in the preceding 
sentence shall, unless otherwise determined in connection with the 
termination of the Grantee's employment, continue to be paid any unpaid 
installments or deferred payments in the same manner as though the 
Grantee's employment had continued without interruption until such cash 
awards are fully paid.  The provisions relating to forfeiture contained in 
this subparagraph shall not apply to cash awards deferred by the Committee 
under clause (b) in the first subparagraph of this Section 8 unless and to 
the extent specifically made applicable by the Committee.  

      If it shall be determined by the Committee that a Grantee who was 
permitted to retain the right to receive any unpaid installments or 
deferred payments upon termination of employment has, after such 
termination of employment, engaged, directly or indirectly, in any activity 
which is in competition with any activity of the Company or whose actions 
or conduct, either prior to or after such termination of employment, has 
been in any manner adverse or in any way contrary to the best interests of 
the Company, such Grantee shall, unless otherwise determined, lose any 
right to receive any unpaid installments or deferred payments as of the 
first of the month in which such competitive activity or such act or 
conduct first occurred, provided, however, that in no case shall the 
Grantee lose the right to receive any unpaid installments or deferred 
payments as of a date prior to January 1 of the year in which the 
determination resulting in such loss of right is made, and provided 
further, that no installment or amount delivered or paid prior to the date 
of any such determination shall be required to be returned.  Each 
determination provided for in this subparagraph shall be made by the 
Committee under such procedure as may from time to time be prescribed by 
the Committee and shall be made in the absolute discretion of the 
Committee.  Any determination so made, including any determination of the 
time at which such competitive activity or such act or conduct first 
occurred, shall be conclusive.  The provisions relating to forfeiture 
contained in this subparagraph shall not apply to cash awards deferred by 
the Committee under clause (b) in the first subparagraph of this Section 8 
unless and to the extent specifically made applicable by the Committee.  

      A Grantee who loses the right to be paid any unpaid installments or 
deferred payments shall receive forthwith all portions of such Grantee's 
cash awards, unpaid but earned installments or deferred payments not 
otherwise forfeited in accordance with this Section 8.  The unpaid portions 
of installments or deferred payments which are forfeited shall be credited 
to the reserve, if any, for the Plan, or if there is no reserve, shall be 
retained by the Company.

      If a Grantee dies, the Grantee's unpaid and undelivered cash awards 
shall be paid and delivered to the beneficiary previously designated by 
such Grantee in writing, or, if such Grantee did not designate any 
beneficiary in writing or if all of the Grantee's designated beneficiaries 
predeceased the Grantee, to the Grantee's legal representative at such time 
and in such manner as if such Grantee were living and in service with the 
Company unless the Committee in its sole and absolute discretion 
accelerates such payment and delivery.  

9.    Awards Paid in Restricted Stock

      Restricted Stock consists of Shares of Common Stock which are subject 
to a substantial risk of forfeiture and to restrictions on their sale or 
other transfer by the Grantee.  The Committee shall determine the time or 
times within which Shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to 
forfeiture, the time or times at which the restrictions will terminate and 
all other terms and conditions relating to the Restricted Stock.  A Grantee 
who receives Restricted Stock shall execute and deliver to Motorola an 
agreement evidencing the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to 
such Restricted Stock.  A Grantee who receives Restricted Stock may be 
issued a stock certificate in respect of such Shares of Restricted Stock.  
Such certificate, if issued, shall be registered in the name of such 
Grantee, and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, 
conditions, and restrictions applicable to such Shares.  The Committee may 
require that the stock certificates evidencing such Shares be held in 
escrow by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have terminated, 
and that, as a condition to delivery of any Restricted Stock certificate, 
the Grantee shall have delivered to the Company a stock power, endorsed in 
blank, relating to such Restricted Stock certificate.

      All Shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to such restrictions 
and conditions as the Committee may determine, including, but not limited 
to, any or all of the following restrictions and conditions:

(a) a prohibition against the sale, assignment, transfer, pledge or 
encumbrance of the Shares of Restricted Stock, such prohibition to 
terminate at such time or times (including the passage of time only) 
as the Committee shall determine, whether in installments or 
otherwise, or at the time of death, Total and Permanent Disability or 
retirement, or based on service, of the holder of such Shares, or 
otherwise as the Committee may provide;

(b) a provision that the holder of Shares of Restricted Stock forfeit 
all or part of such Shares in the event of termination of his or her 
employment for any reason other than death, Total and Permanent 
Disability or retirement during any period in which such Shares are 
subject to restrictions; or a provision vesting such Shares in the 
event of termination of employment; or

(c) a provision that the holder of Shares of Restricted Stock forfeit 
such Shares in the event the Grantee engages, directly or indirectly, 
in any activity which is in competition with any activity of the 
Company or any subsidiary or in any action or conduct which is in any 
manner adverse or in any way contrary to the interests of the Company 
or any subsidiary unless otherwise determined by the Committee.  The 
determination of whether a Grantee is or has engaged in any 
competitive activity or in any action or conduct which is adverse or 
contrary to the interests of the Company or any of its subsidiaries 
shall be made by the Committee, and such determination shall be 
conclusive and binding upon all parties.

      The Committee shall have the right at any time to accelerate, reduce 
or terminate any restrictions, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.

      Promptly after the termination of the restrictions, by lapse of time 
or otherwise, without a prior forfeiture, with respect to Shares of 
Restricted Stock, a certificate for such Shares shall be delivered free of 
all restrictions and legends together with deferred dividends, if any, to 
the Grantee or to the Grantee's legal representative, beneficiary or heir.  
If a stock certificate was previously delivered to the Grantee, the 
replacement certificate will not be delivered to the Grantee until the 
previously delivered certificate is returned to the Company in a form 
acceptable for transfer, free and clear of all liens, claims and 
encumbrances.

      Subject to the applicable restrictions, the Grantee may be given, 
with respect to the Shares of Restricted Stock, any or all rights of a 
stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the Shares, and the 
right to receive any cash or stock dividends.  The Committee, in its sole 
discretion, as determined at the time of the award, may permit or require 
the payment of cash dividends to be deferred and, if the Committee so 
determines, reinvested in additional Restricted Stock or otherwise be 
reinvested.  The Committee may require that stock dividends issued with 
respect to Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of 
Restricted Stock that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms 
and conditions that apply to the Shares with respect to which such 
dividends are issued.

10.   Change in Control

      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8 or any of the eligibility 
requirements of the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control, all Grantees 
on the date of the Change in Control shall have a fully vested and 
nonforfeitable right to receive all amounts of all cash awards which remain 
payable under clause (a) of the first subparagraph of Section 8 or which 
were previously deferred under clauses (b) or (c) of the first subparagraph 
of Section 8, and no amendment, suspension, curtailment or termination of 
the Plan shall adversely affect or terminate such vested and nonforfeitable 
right to receive any cash award granted under the Plan.

      Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the restrictions on all 
Shares of Restricted Stock outstanding on the date on which the Change in 
Control occurs shall be automatically terminated and each Grantee holding 
Restricted Stock shall have the right to receive unrestricted Shares in 
substitution for the Shares of Restricted Stock or, at his or her election 
made during a period of sixty (60) days following the date on which the 
Change in Control occurs, the right to have the Company purchase any or all 
Shares of Restricted Stock for an immediate lump-sum cash payment equal to 
the product of (1) the higher of (i) the average of the high and low sale 
prices of the Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange - 
Composite Transactions on the date of payment, or if Shares did not trade 
on such date, on the last previous day on which Shares traded prior to such 
date, or (ii) the highest per Share price for Common Stock actually paid in 
connection with the Change in Control and (2) the number of Shares of such 
Restricted Stock.

      For purposes of the Plan, a "Change in Control" shall mean a Change 
in Control of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to 
Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, ("Exchange Act") whether or 
not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided 
that, without limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have 
occurred if (A) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Section 
13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" 
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, 
of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the combined 
voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (other than the 
Company, any employee benefit plan of the Company, any "person" who is a 
natural person and was shown as the "beneficial owner", directly or 
indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 5% of the 
combined voting power of the Company's securities in the Company's Proxy 
Statement dated earlier than, but closest to, the date the Plan is approved 
by the Company's stockholders, and, for purposes of the Plan, no Change in 
Control shall be deemed to have occurred as a result of the "beneficial 
ownership," or changes therein, of the Company's securities by any of the 
foregoing), (B) there shall be consummated (i) any consolidation or merger 
of the Company in which the Company is not the surviving or continuing 
corporation or pursuant to which shares of the Company's Common Stock would 
be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger 
of the Company in which the holders of the Company's Common Stock 
immediately prior to the merger have (directly or indirectly) at least an 
80% ownership interest in the outstanding Common Stock of the surviving 
corporation immediately after the merger, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange 
or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) 
of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, (C) the 
stockholders of the Company approve any plan or proposal for the 
liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (D) as a result of, or in 
connection with, any cash tender offer, exchange offer, merger or other 
business combination, sale of assets, proxy or consent solicitation (other 
than by the Board of Directors ("Board") of the Company ), contested 
election or substantial stock accumulation (a "Control Transaction"), the 
members of the Board immediately prior to the first public announcement 
relating to such Control Transaction shall thereafter cease to constitute a 
majority of the Board.  

      Furthermore, in the event a Grantee's employment with the Company 
terminates within one year of a Change in Control, that Grantee shall 
receive an award(s) for the Cycle(s) in which the Grantee's employment is 
terminated.  Such award(s) shall be prorated from the first day of the 
Cycle(s) in which the Grantee's employment is terminated up to the date of 
termination of employment.  This pro rata share of the award(s) shall be 
paid within thirty days after the date on which the Grantee's employment is 
terminated.  

      A Grantee shall be entitled to a pro rata award(s) if his or her 
employment with the Company is terminated for any reason (including 
disability or retirement) except:  (a) when the relevant Change in Control 
occurs as a result of a transaction or transactions initiated by the 
Company, other than a transaction or transactions initiated by the Company 
in response to or otherwise in connection with an unsolicited proposal to 
the Company which would result in a Change in Control, or (b) the Company 
terminates the Grantee's employment with the Company or a subsidiary of the 
Company for good cause.  For purposes of the Plan, "good cause" means (a) 
the conviction of a Grantee of any criminal violation involving dishonesty, 
fraud or breach of trust, or (b) the Grantee's willful engagement in gross 
misconduct in the performance of his or her duties that materially injures 
the Company.  

11.   Nature of Grantee's Rights Under the Plan   

      Neither the adoption of the Plan, nor any modification thereof, nor 
any payment thereunder, shall be construed as giving to the Grantee or any 
person whomsoever any legal or equitable rights against the Company or its 
officers or directors or as giving any Grantee the right to be retained in 
the service of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  No loan shall be 
made to any Grantee by the Company because one or more payments might be 
made to the Grantee under the Plan.  No Grantee shall have any right to 
assign, transfer, appropriate, encumber, commute or anticipate any payment 
that might be made to the Grantee under the Plan, and no benefits, rights 
or interest of a Grantee under the Plan shall in any way be subject to any 
legal process to levy upon, garnishee or attach the same for payment of any 
claim against the Grantee, nor shall any Grantee have any right of any kind 
whatsoever under the Plan other than the right to receive any payment as 
and when it is due and payable under the terms of the Plan.  

12.   Administration of the Plan

      The Committee shall keep and maintain records and accounts which will 
accurately disclose at all times the reserve for the Plan, if any, for each 
year during which the Plan is in effect, the awards made under the Plan, 
the payment or other disposition of these awards, and any other pertinent 
information with respect to the activities of the Committee.  

      The fiscal year of the Plan shall at all times be the same as the 
fiscal year of the Company.  

      The Committee may consult with counsel, who may be of counsel to the 
Company, and shall not incur any liability for any action taken in good 
faith in reliance upon the advice of such counsel.  

      The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company 
and shall not be charged against the reserve for the Plan, if any.  

13.   Indemnification and Exculpation

      Each person who is or shall have been a member of the Board or of the 
Committee shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and 
from any and all loss, cost, liability or expense that may be imposed upon 
or reasonably incurred by such person in connection with or resulting from 
any claim, action, suit or proceeding to which such person may be a party 
or in which such person may be involved by reason of any action taken or 
failure to act under the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid 
by such person in settlement thereof (with the Company's written approval) 
or paid by such person in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, 
suit or proceeding, except a judgment based upon a finding of such person's 
bad faith, subject, however, to the condition that upon the institution of 
any claim, action, suit or proceeding against such person, such person 
shall in writing give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to 
participate in, and to the extent it may wish, to assume the defense 
thereof before such person undertakes to handle it on such person's own 
behalf.  The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of 
any other right to which such person may be entitled as a matter of law or 
otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify such person 
or hold such person harmless.  

      Each member of the Board or of the Committee, and each officer and 
employee of the Company shall be fully justified in relying or acting upon 
any information furnished on behalf of the Company by any person or persons 
other than himself or herself in connection with the administration of the 
Plan.  In no event shall any person who is or shall have been a member of 
the Board or of the Committee, or any officer or employee of the Company, 
be liable for any determination made or other action taken or any omission 
to act in reliance upon any such information, or for any action (including 
the furnishing of information) taken or any failure to act, if in good 
faith. 

14.   Amendment of the Plan

      The Plan may be amended from time to time by  the Board or the 
Committee and may be terminated at any time by the Board.

6.     Restricted Stock

Each Non-Employee Director who receives Restricted Stock shall execute and 
deliver to the Company an agreement evidencing the terms, conditions and 
restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.  Each Non-Employee 
Director receiving Restricted Stock may be issued a stock certificate with 
respect to such shares of Restricted Stock.  Such certificate, if issued, 
shall be registered in the name of such Non-Employee Director and shall 
bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, and 
restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock.  The Committee may 
require that the stock certificates evidencing such Restricted Stock be 
held in escrow by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have 
terminated and that, as a condition to delivery of any Restricted Stock 
certificate, the Non-Employee Director deliver to the Company a stock 
power, endorsed in blank, relating to such Restricted Stock certificate.

All shares of Restricted Stock shall be subject to such restrictions and 
conditions as the Committee may determine, including, without limitation, 
any or all of the following restrictions and conditions:

     (a)     a prohibition against the sale, assignment, transfer, 
pledge or encumbrance of the Restricted Stock, with such prohibition 
to terminate at the end of a fixed number of months, to be set by the 
Committee, after the date of purchase or, if earlier, upon the Non-
Employee Director's cessation of services as a Non-Employee Director 
because of his or her failure to stand for re-election at or after 
age 65, failure to be re-elected at or after age 65, Total and 
Permanent Disability or death;

      (b)     a provision that the Non-Employee Director resell back 
to the Company at the price the Non-Employee Director paid, all or 
part of such Restricted Stock, in the event of termination of his or 
her services for any reason other than failure to stand for re-
election at or after age 65, failure to be re-elected at or after age 
65, Total and Permanent Disability or death during any period in 
which such Restricted Stock is subject to restrictions; and
	
      (c)     a provision that the Non-Employee Director resell back 
to the Company at the price the Non-Employee Director paid, all such 
Restricted Stock in the event the Non-Employee Director during or 
after his or her service on the Board, engages, directly or 
indirectly, in any activity which is in competition with any activity 
of the Company or any Subsidiary or in any action or conduct which is 
in any manner adverse or in any way contrary to the interests of the 
Company or any Subsidiary unless otherwise determined by the 
Committee.  The determination of whether a Director is engaging in, 
or has engaged in, any competitive activity or in any action or 
conduct which is adverse or contrary to the interests of the Company 
or any of its Subsidiaries shall be made by the Committee, and such 
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties.

The Committee shall have the right at any time to accelerate, reduce or 
terminate any restrictions, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.

Promptly after the termination of the restrictions, by lapse of time or 
otherwise, without a prior forfeiture, with respect to shares of Restricted 
Stock, a certificate for such shares shall be delivered free of all 
restrictions and legends together with deferred dividends, if any, to the 
Non-Employee Director.  If a stock certificate was previously delivered to 
the Non-Employee Director, the replacement certificate will not be 
delivered to the Non-Employee Director until the previously delivered 
certificate is returned to the Company in a form acceptable for transfer, 
free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances.

Subject to the applicable restrictions, the Non-Employee Director may be 
given, with respect to the shares of Restricted Stock, any or all rights of 
a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares, and 
the right to receive any cash or stock dividends.  The payment of cash 
dividends may be required by the Committee to be deferred and reinvested in 
additional Restricted Stock.  The stock dividends issued with respect to 
Restricted Stock shall be treated as additional shares of Restricted Stock 
that are subject to the same restrictions and other terms and conditions 
that apply to the shares with respect to which such dividends are issued.

7.     Issuance of Common Stock and Restricted Stock

If a Non-Employee Director elects pursuant to Section 5 above to receive 
Restricted Stock in lieu of Common Stock Compensation and/or to receive 
Common Stock and/or Restricted Stock in lieu of cash Compensation, there 
shall be issued to such director promptly after the end of each calendar 
quarter with respect to which such election applies a number of shares of 
Common Stock and/or Restricted Stock determined as follows:  (a) with 
respect to Restricted Stock which is to be paid in lieu of Common Stock 
Compensation, a number of shares of Restricted Stock equal to the number of 
shares of Common Stock which would otherwise have been paid and (b) with 
respect to Common Stock and/or Restricted Stock which is to be paid in lieu 
of cash Compensation, a number of shares of Common Stock and/or Restricted 
Stock equal to the amount of such cash Compensation divided by the average 
of the high and low prices per Share of Common Stock as reported on the New 
York Stock Exchange - Composite Transactions on the last business day of 
the calendar quarter for which the Compensation would have been paid in 
cash in the absence of such election; provided, however, if the New York 
Stock Exchange is not open for trading on such business day or if Common 
Stock does not trade on such business day, the average of the high and low 
prices for the last day of such calendar quarter on which Common Stock did 
so trade shall be used.  To the extent that the application of the 
foregoing formula would result in fractional shares of Common Stock being 
issuable, cash will be paid to the Non-Employee Director in lieu of such 
fractional shares based upon the value established pursuant to such 
formula.

8.     Change in Control

A Change in Control shall mean a change in control of a nature that would 
be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of 
Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act whether or not the 
Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, 
without limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have 
occurred if (A) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Section 
13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial owner" 
(as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, 
of securities of the Company representing 20% or more of the combined 
voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (other than the 
Company or any employee benefit plan of the Company; and, for purposes of 
the Plan, no Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred as a result 
of the "beneficial ownership," or changes therein, of the Company's 
securities by either of the foregoing), (B) there shall be consummated (i) 
any consolidation or merger of the Company in which the Company is not the 
surviving or continuing corporation or pursuant to which Shares of Common 
Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other 
than a merger of the Company in which the holders of Common Stock 
immediately prior to the merger have (directly or indirectly) at least an 
80% ownership interest in the outstanding common stock of the surviving 
corporation immediately after the merger, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange 
or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) 
of all, or substantially all, of the assets of the Company, (C) the 
stockholders of the Company approve any plan or proposal for the 
liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (D) as the result of, or in 
connection with, any cash tender offer, exchange offer, merger or other 
business combination, sale of assets, proxy or consent solicitation (other 
than by the Board), contested election or substantial stock accumulation (a 
"Control Transaction"), the members of the Board immediately prior to the 
first public announcement relating to such Control Transaction shall 
thereafter cease to constitute a majority of the Board.

Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the restrictions on all shares 
of Restricted Stock outstanding on the date on which the Change in Control 
occurs shall be automatically terminated and each Non-Employee Director 
holding Restricted Stock shall have the right to receive unrestricted 
Shares in substitution for the shares of Restricted Stock or, at his or her 
election made during a period of sixty (60) days following the date on 
which the Change in Control occurs, the right to have the Company purchase 
any or all shares of Restricted Stock for an immediate lump sum cash 
payment equal to the product of (1) the higher of (i) the average of the 
high and low sale prices of the Common Stock as reported on the New York 
Stock Exchange  - Composite Transactions on the date immediately prior to 
the date of payment, or if Shares did not trade on such date, on the last 
previous day on which Shares traded prior to such date, or (ii) the highest 
per Share price for Common Stock actually paid in connection with the 
Change in Control and (2) the number of shares of such Restricted Stock.

9.      Number of Shares of Common Stock Issuable Under the Plan

The maximum number of Shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the 
Plan shall be 100,000; provided, however, that if the Company shall at any 
time increase or decrease the number of its outstanding Shares of Common 
Stock or change in any way the rights and privileges of such Shares by 
means of a payment of a stock dividend or any other distribution upon such 
Shares payable in Common Stock, or through a stock split, reverse stock 
split, subdivision, consolidation, combination, reclassification or 
recapitalization involving Common Stock, then the numbers, rights and 
privileges of the Shares issuable under the Plan shall be increased, 
decreased or changed in like manner.  In addition, Compensation payable in 
Common Stock and Restricted Stock to Non-Employee Directors under the Plan 
may be paid from Shares reserved or available for issuance under the 
Motorola Incentive Plan of 1998.

10.     Miscellaneous Provisions

(a)    Neither the Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed 
as giving any Non-Employee Director any right to be retained in the service 
of the Company.

(b)    A participant's rights and interest under the Plan may not be 
assigned or transferred, hypothecated or encumbered in whole or in part 
either directly or by operation of law or otherwise (except in the event of 
a participant's death, by will or the laws of descent and distribution), 
including, but not by way of limitation, execution, levy, garnishment, 
attachment, pledge, bankruptcy or in any other manner, and no such right or 
interest of any participant in the Plan shall be subject to any obligation 
or liability of such participant.

(c)     No shares of Common Stock shall be issued hereunder unless counsel 
for the Company shall be satisfied that such issuance will be in compliance 
with applicable federal, state, local and foreign securities, securities 
exchange and other applicable laws and requirements.

(d)     It shall be a condition to the obligation of the Company to issue 
shares of Common Stock hereunder, that the participant pay to the Company, 
upon its demand, such amount as may be requested by the Company for the 
purpose of satisfying any liability to withhold federal, state, local or 
foreign income or other taxes.  If the amount requested is not paid, the 
Company shall have no obligation to issue, and the participant shall have 
no right to receive, shares of Common Stock.

(e)     The expenses of the Plan shall be borne by the Company.

(f)     The Plan shall be unfunded.  The Company shall not be required to 
establish any special or separate fund or reserve or to make any other 
segregation of assets to assure the issuance of shares hereunder.

(g)     By accepting any Common Stock or Restricted Stock hereunder or 
other benefit under the Plan, each participant and each person claiming 
under or through him or her shall be conclusively deemed to have indicated 
his or her acceptance and ratification of, and consent to, any action taken 
under the Plan by the Company or the Committee.

(h)     The appropriate officers of the Company shall cause to be filed any 
registration statement required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, 
and any reports, returns or other information regarding any shares of 
Common Stock issued pursuant hereto as may be required by Section 13 or 
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange 
Act"), or any other applicable statute, rule or regulation.

(i)     The provisions of this Plan shall be governed by and construed in 
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

(j)     Pending issuance of shares of Common Stock or Restricted Stock 
hereunder, all Compensation earned by a Non-Employee Director with respect 
to which an election to receive Common Stock and/or Restricted Stock in 
lieu of cash Compensation pursuant to Section 5 above has been made shall 
be the property of such director and shall be paid to him or her in cash in 
the event that shares of Common Stock and/or Restricted Stock are not used.

(k)     Headings are given to the sections of this Plan solely as a 
convenience to facilitate reference.  Such headings, numbering and 
paragraphing shall not in any case be deemed in any way material or 
relevant to the construction of this Plan or any provisions thereof.  The 
use of the singular shall also include within its meaning the plural, where 
appropriate, and vice versa.

11.     Amendment

The Plan may be amended at any time and from time to time by resolution of 
the Board as the Board shall deem advisable; provided, however, that no 
amendment shall become effective without stockholder approval if such 
stockholder approval is required by law, rule or regulation.  No amendment 
of the Plan shall materially and adversely affect any right of any 
participant with respect to any shares of Common Stock and/or Restricted 
Stock theretofore issued without such participant's written consent.

12.     Termination

This Plan shall terminate upon the earlier of the following dates or events 
to occur:  (a)  upon the adoption of a resolution of the Board terminating 
the Plan; or (b)  ten years from the date the Plan is initially approved 
and adopted by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 
13 below.  No termination of the Plan shall materially and/or adversely 
affect any of the rights or obligations of any Non-Employee Director 
without his or her consent with respect to any shares of Common Stock 
and/or Restricted Stock theretofore paid for and issuable under the Plan.

13.     Stockholder Approval and Adoption

The Plan shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their 
approval and adoption at the meeting of stockholders of the Company to be 
held on May 2, 1995.  The Plan shall not be effective unless and until the 
Plan has been so approved and adopted.  The stockholders shall be deemed to 
have approved and adopted the Plan only if it is approved and adopted at a 
meeting of the stockholders duly held on that date (or any adjournment of 
said meeting occurring subsequent to such date) by vote taken in the manner 
required by the laws of the State of Delaware.

                      (Revised as of July 16, 1997)

                               ARTICLE I
                       Offices and Corporate Seal

     The registered office of the Corporation required by the Delaware 
General Corporation Law shall be 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington, Delaware, 
19801, and the address of the registered office may be changed from time to 
time by the Board of Directors.
     The principal business office of the Corporation shall be located in 
the Village of Schaumburg, County of Cook, State of Illinois.  The 
Corporation may have such other offices, either within or without the State 
of Illinois, as the Board of Directors may designate or as the business of 
the Corporation may require from time to time.
     The registered office of the Corporation required by the Illinois 
Business Corporation Act may be, but need not be, the same as its place of 
business in the State of Illinois, and the address of the registered office 
may be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors.
     The Board of Directors shall provide a corporate seal which shall be 
circular in form and shall have inscribed thereon the name of the 
Corporation and the state of incorporation and the words "Corporate Seal".

                               ARTICLE II
                           Board of Directors
     Section 1.  General Powers.  The business and affairs of the 
Corporation shall be managed by, or under the direction of, its Board of 
Directors.
     Section 2.  Number, Tenure and Qualifications.  The number of 
directors of the Corporation shall be seventeen (17), or such other number 
fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors.  Each director shall 
hold office until his successor shall have been elected and qualified, or 
until his earlier death or resignation.
     Section 3.  Vacancies.  Any vacancy occurring in the Board of 
Directors, including a vacancy created by an increase in the number of 
directors, may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term by the 
affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office although 
less than a quorum.
     Section 4.  Compensation.  Directors who also are employees of the 
Corporation shall not receive any additional compensation for services on 
the Board of Directors.  By resolution of the Board of Directors, a fixed 
sum may be allowed directors who are not employees of the Corporation for 
attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or 
any committee of the Board of Directors, and by resolution of the Board of 
Directors an additional fixed fee may be allowed directors who are not 
employees of the Corporation in consideration of other services and 
continuous interest and study of the affairs of the Corporation.  Travel 
and other expenses actually incurred may be allowed all directors for 
attendance at each regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors or 
at any meeting of a committee of the Board of Directors or in connection 
with their other services to the Corporation.  Nothing herein contained 
shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in 
any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.
     Section 5.  Committees of Directors.  The Board of Directors may, by 
resolution passed by a majority of the whole Board, designate one or more 
committees.  Each committee shall consist of one or more of the directors 
of the Corporation, as selected by the Board of Directors, and the Board of 
Directors shall also designate a chairman of each committee and the members 
of each committee shall designate a person to act as secretary of the 
committee to keep the minutes of, and serve the notices for, all meetings 
of the committee and perform such other duties as the committee may direct.  
Such person may, but need not be a member of the committee.  Any such 
committee, to the extent provided in a resolution of the Board of 
Directors, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the 
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the 
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to 
all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power 
and authority of the Board of Directors in reference to amending the 
Certificate of Incorporation, adopting an agreement of merger or 
consolidation under Section 251 or 252 of the Delaware General Corporation 
Law, recommending to the shareholders the sale, lease or exchange of all or 
substantially all of the Corporation's property and assets, recommending to 
the shareholders a dissolution of the Corporation or a revocation of a 
dissolution, or amending the Bylaws of the Corporation, and, unless the 
resolution expressly so provides, no such committee shall have the power or 
authority to declare a dividend or to authorize the issuance of stock or to 
adopt a certificate of ownership and merger pursuant to Section 253 of the 
Delaware General Corporation Law.  Each committee of the Board of Directors 
may establish its own rules of procedure.  Except as otherwise specified in 
a resolution designating a committee, one-third of the members of a 
committee shall be necessary to constitute a quorum of that committee for 
the transaction of business and the act of a majority of committee members 
present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the 
committee. 
     Section 6.  Validity of Contracts.  No contract or other transaction 
entered into by the Corporation shall be affected by the fact that a 
director or officer of the Corporation is in any way interested in or 
connected with any party to such contract or transaction, or himself is a 
party to such contract or transaction, even though in the case of a 
director the vote of the director having such interest or connection shall 
have been necessary to obligate the Corporation upon such contract or 
transaction; provided, however, that in any such case (i) the material 
facts of such interest are known or disclosed to the directors or 
shareholders and the contract or transaction is authorized or approved in 
good faith by the shareholders or by the Board of Directors or a committee 
thereof through the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested 
directors (even though not a quorum), or (ii) the contract or transaction 
is fair to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or 
ratified by the shareholders, or by the Board of Directors, or by a 
committee thereof.

                              ARTICLE III
                         Shareholders' Meetings
     Section 1.  Place of Meetings.  The Board of Directors may designate 
any place, either within or without the State of Delaware, as the place of 
meeting for any annual meeting or for any special meeting called by the 
Board of Directors.  If no designation is made, or if a special meeting be 
otherwise called, the place of meeting shall be the principal business 
office of the Corporation in the State of Illinois.
     Section 2.  Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of the shareholders 
shall be held on the first Tuesday in the month of May in each year, at the 
hour of 5:00 o'clock P.M., or at such other day and hour as may be fixed by 
or under the authority of the Board of Directors, for the purpose of 
electing directors and for the transaction of such other business as may 
come before the meeting.  If the day fixed for the annual meeting shall be 
a legal holiday in the state where the meeting is to be held, such meeting 
shall be held on the next succeeding business day.  If the election of 
directors shall not be held on the day designated herein for the annual 
meeting of the shareholders, or at any adjournment thereof, the Board of 
Directors shall cause the election to be held at a special meeting of the 
shareholders as soon thereafter as is convenient.
     Section 3.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the shareholders, 
for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise prescribed by statute, may be 
called by the Chairman of the Board or by the Board of Directors.
     Section 4.  Voting - Quorum.  Each outstanding share, regardless of 
class, shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at 
a meeting of shareholders, except to the extent that the voting rights of 
any class or classes are enlarged, limited or denied by the Certificate of 
Incorporation or in the manner therein provided.  A majority of the shares 
entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a 
quorum at a meeting of shareholders.  If a quorum is present, the 
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the meeting and 
entitled to vote on the subject matter shall be the act of the 
shareholders, except that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the 
votes of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the 
election of directors, except as otherwise required by Delaware law, the 
Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws.  No matter shall be 
considered at a meeting of shareholders except upon a motion duly made and 
seconded.  If less than a majority of the outstanding shares are 
represented at a meeting, a majority of the shares so represented may 
adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.  At such 
adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any 
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting 
as originally called.
     Section 5.  Adjournment of Meetings.  If less than a majority of the 
outstanding shares are represented at a meeting of the shareholders, a 
majority of the shares so represented may adjourn the meeting from time to 
time without further notice.  The chairman of a meeting of the shareholders 
may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice, whether 
or not less than a majority of the outstanding shares are represented at 
the meeting.  No notice of the time and place of adjourned meetings need be 
given except as required by law.  In no event shall the public announcement 
of an adjournment of any meeting of the shareholders commence a new time 
period for the giving of shareholder notice of nominations or proposals for 
other business as described in Section 13 of Article III.  At such 
adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented, any 
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting 
as originally called.
     Section 6.  Proxies.  At all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder 
may vote by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by his duly 
authorized attorney-in-fact.  No proxy shall be valid after three years 
from the date of its execution, unless otherwise provided in the proxy.
     Section 7.  Notice of Meetings.  Written notice stating the place, day 
and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose 
or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less 
than ten days (twenty days if the shareholders are to approve a merger or 
consolidation or a sale, lease or exchange of all or substantially all the 
Corporation's assets) nor more than sixty days before the date of the 
meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the 
Chairman of the Board, or the Secretary, or the officer or persons calling 
the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such 
meeting.  If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited 
in the United States mail, addressed to the shareholder at his address as 
it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage thereon prepaid.
     Section 8.  Postponement of Meetings.  Any previously scheduled 
meeting of the shareholders may be postponed by resolution of the Board of 
Directors upon public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled 
for such meeting of the shareholders.  In no event shall the public 
announcement of a postponement of any previously scheduled meeting of the 
shareholders commence a new time period for the giving of shareholder 
notice of nominations or proposals for other business as described in 
Section 13 of Article III.
     Section 9.  Cancellation of Meetings.  Any special meeting of the 
shareholders may be canceled by resolution of the Board of Directors upon 
public notice given prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting 
of the shareholders.
     Section 10.  Voting Lists.  The officer or agent having charge of the 
stock ledger of the Corporation shall make, at least ten days before each 
meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to 
vote at such meeting, or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical 
order, with the address of and the number of shares held by each; which 
list, for a period of ten days prior to such meeting, shall be kept at the 
place where the meeting is to be held, or at another place within the city 
where the meeting is to be held, which other place shall be specified in 
the notice of meeting and the list shall be subject to inspection by any 
shareholder for any purpose germane to the meeting, at any time during 
usual business hours.  Such list shall also be produced and kept open at 
the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of 
any shareholder during the whole time of the meeting.  The original stock 
ledger shall be prima facie evidence as to who are the shareholders 
entitled to examine such list or ledger or to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders.
     Section 11.  Fixing of Record Date.  For the purpose of determining 
shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to receive payment of 
any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any 
other proper purpose, the Board of Directors of the Corporation may fix in 
advance a date as the record date for any such determination of 
shareholders, such date in any case to be not more than sixty days and, in 
case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than ten days prior to the date 
on which the particular action, requiring such determination of 
shareholders, is to be taken.  If no record date is fixed for the 
determination of shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting 
of shareholders, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend, 
the close of business on the date next preceding the date on which notice 
of the meeting is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Board 
of Directors declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall 
be the record date for such determination of shareholders.  When a 
determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of 
shareholders has been made as provided in this Section, such determination 
shall apply to any adjournment thereof; provided, however, that the Board 
of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
     Section 12.  Voting of Shares by Certain Holders.  Neither treasury 
shares nor shares of the Corporation held by another corporation, if a 
majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of 
such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, 
shall be entitled to vote or to be counted for quorum purposes.  Nothing in 
this paragraph shall be construed as limiting the right of the Corporation 
to vote its own stock held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
     Shares standing in the name of another corporation, domestic or 
foreign, may be voted in the name of such corporation by any officer 
thereof or pursuant to any proxy executed in the name of such corporation 
by any officer of such corporation in the absence of express written notice 
filed with the Secretary that such officer has no authority to vote such 
shares.
     Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, 
trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or assignee for creditors may be voted by 
him, either in person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into 
his name.  Shares standing in the name of a fiduciary may be voted by him, 
either in person or by proxy.
     A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such 
shares unless in the transfer by the pledgor on the books of the 
Corporation the pledgor has expressly empowered the pledgee to vote 
thereon, in which case only the pledgee, or his proxy, may represent such 
stock and vote thereon.
     Section 13.  Advance Notice of Shareholder Nominations and Proposals 
for other Business.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of 
Directors and the proposal of business to be transacted by the shareholders 
may be made at an annual or special meeting of the shareholders only (a) 
pursuant to the Corporation's notice with respect to such meeting, (b) by 
or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (c) by any shareholder of 
the Corporation who was a shareholder of record on the record date set with 
respect to such meeting as provided for in Section 11 of Article III, who 
is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the notice 
procedures set forth in this Section 13.  For nominations or proposals for 
other business to be properly brought before an annual or special meeting 
by a shareholder pursuant to clause (c) above, the shareholder must give 
timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation and 
such business must be a proper matter for shareholder action under the 
Delaware General Corporation Law and a proper matter for consideration at 
such meeting under the Certificate of Incorporation and these Bylaws.  For 
such notice to be timely, it must be delivered to the Secretary at the 
principal business office of the Corporation not earlier than the 90th day 
prior to the date of such meeting and not later than the close of business 
on the later of (i) the 60th day prior to the date of such meeting or (ii) 
the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of 
such meeting is first made.  If such shareholder notice relates to a 
proposal by such shareholder to nominate one or more persons for election 
or re-election as a director, it shall set forth all information relating 
to each such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of 
proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case 
pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (the "Exchange Act") (including, if and to the extent so required, 
such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a 
nominee and to serving as a director if elected).  If such shareholder 
notice relates to any other business that the shareholder proposes to bring 
before the meeting, it shall set forth a  brief description of such 
business, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any 
material interest in such business of such shareholder and the beneficial 
owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made.  Each such notice 
shall also set forth as to the shareholder giving the notice and the 
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is 
made (i) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the 
Corporation's books, and of such beneficial owner and (ii) the class and 
number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned 
beneficially and of record by such shareholder and such beneficial owner.   
Persons nominated by shareholders to serve as directors of the Corporation 
who have not been nominated in accordance with this Section 13 shall not be 
eligible to serve as directors.  Only such business shall be conducted at 
an annual or special meeting of shareholders as shall have been brought 
before the meeting in accordance with this Section 13.  The chairman of the 
meeting shall determine whether a nomination or any business proposed to be 
transacted by the shareholders has been properly brought before the meeting 
and, if any proposed nomination or business has not been properly brought 
before the meeting, the chairman shall declare that such proposed business 
or nomination shall not be presented for shareholder action at the meeting.  
For purposes of this Section 13, "public announcement" shall mean 
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, 
Associated Press or a comparable national news service.  Notwithstanding 
any provision in this Section 13 to the contrary, requests for inclusion of 
proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement made pursuant to Rule 14a-8 
under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to have been delivered in a timely 
manner if delivered in accordance with such Rule. Notwithstanding 
compliance with the requirements of this Section 13, the chairman presiding 
at any meeting of the shareholders may, in his sole discretion, refuse to 
allow a shareholder or shareholder representative to present any proposal 
which the Corporation would not be required to include in a proxy statement 
under any rule promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                              ARTICLE IV
                      Board of Directors' Meetings
     Section 1.  Annual Meetings.  An annual meeting of the Board of 
Directors shall be held without other notice than this Bylaw immediately 
after, and at the same place as, the annual meeting of shareholders.
     Section 2.  Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of 
Directors may be called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board 
or any two directors.  The person or persons authorized to call special 
meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place, either within or 
without the State of Delaware, as the place for holding any special meeting 
of the Board of Directors called by them.
     Section 3.  Notice.  Except as set forth in the next sentence, notice 
of any special meeting shall be given at least 24 hours prior to the 
meeting by written notice delivered or given personally (including by 
phone) or by mail or telegram or other written communication to each 
director at his business address or residence.  If, however, the meeting is 
called by or at the request of the Chairman of the Board and if the 
Chairman of the Board decides that unusual and urgent business is to be 
transacted at the meeting (which decision shall be conclusively 
demonstrated by his giving notice of the meeting less than 24 hours prior 
to the meeting), then at least 2 hours' prior notice shall be given.  If 
notice is given by telegram or courier, such notice shall be deemed to be 
given when the telegram is delivered to the telegraph company or courier 
company and any personal notice shall be deemed given when given.  Any 
director may waive notice of any meeting.  The attendance of a director at 
a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where 
a director attends a meeting and objects thereat to the transaction of any 
business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.  Neither 
the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or 
special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified in the notice 
or waiver of notice of such meeting.
     Section 4.  Quorum.  One-third of the number of directors fixed by, or 
pursuant to, Section 2 of Article II shall constitute a quorum for the 
transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, but if 
less than such one-third is present at a meeting, a majority of the 
directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further 
notice.
     Section 5.  Manner of Acting.  The act of the majority of the 
directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the 
act of the Board of Directors.
     Section 6.  Presumption of Assent.  A director of the Corporation who 
is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors at which action on any 
corporate matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action 
taken unless his dissent is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless 
he files his written dissent to such action with the person acting as the 
secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or forwards such 
dissent by registered mail to the Secretary of the Corporation immediately 
after the adjournment of the meeting.  Such right to dissent shall not 
apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.
     Section 7.  Action by Directors Without a Meeting.  Any action 
required to be taken at a meeting of directors, or at a meeting of a 
committee of directors, or any other action which may be taken at a 
meeting, may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing setting 
forth the action so taken shall be signed by all of the directors or 
members of the committee thereof entitled to vote with respect to the 
subject matter thereof and filed with the minutes of proceedings of the 
Board of Directors or committee and such consent shall have the same force 
and effect as a unanimous vote.
     Section 8.  Participation in a Meeting by Telephone.  Members of the 
Board of Directors or any committee of directors may participate in a 
meeting of such Board or committee by means of conference telephone or 
similar communications equipment by means of which all persons 
participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participating in a 
meeting pursuant to this Section 8 shall constitute presence in person at 
such meeting.

                              ARTICLE V
                    Officers and Chairman of the Board
     Section 1.  Number, Election, Appointment, Removal, Vacancy.  The 
elected officers of the Corporation shall be one Chairman, one Chief 
Executive Officer, a President, one or more Vice Presidents, a Chief 
Financial Officer, a Treasurer, a Secretary and a Controller, each of whom 
shall be elected by the Board of Directors.  The appointed officers of the

the Board and a Chairman of the Executive Committee may be elected by the 
Board of Directors.  Any two or more offices may be held by the same 
person, except the offices of President and Secretary, and the offices of 
President and Vice President.  The elected officers of the Corporation 
shall be elected annually by the Board of Directors at the first meeting of 
the Board of Directors held after each annual meeting of the shareholders.

officer shall hold office until his successor shall have been duly elected 
or until his death or until he shall resign or shall have been removed in 
the manner hereinafter provided.  Any officer elected by the Board of 
Directors may be removed by the Board of Directors whenever in its judgment 
the best interests of the Corporation would be served thereby, but such 
removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the 
person so removed.  Election shall not of itself create contract rights.  A 
vacancy in any elected office because of death, resignation, removal, 
disqualification or otherwise, may be filled by the Board of Directors for 
the unexpired portion of the term.  
	     Section 2.  Chairman of the Board of Directors.  At its first meeting 
after the annual meeting of shareholders, the Board of Directors shall 
elect one of its own members to be the Chairman of the Board of Directors 
("Chairman of the Board").  The Chairman of the Board shall work with the 
Board of Directors to define its structure, agenda and activities in order 
to fulfill its responsibilities and shall work with senior management to 
help ensure that matters for which management is responsible are 
appropriately reported to the Board of Directors.  He shall preside at all 
meetings of the shareholders and of the Board of Directors and shall call 
and prescribe the content of such meetings.  The Chairman of the Board 
shall lead the Board of Directors in its role of assessing the performance 
of the management of the Corporation.  The Chairman of the Board shall also 
counsel the members of the Chief Executive Office, where appropriate, and 
shall perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of 
Directors from time to time.  The Chairman of the Board may designate one 
or more other directors to exercise the functions and to have the authority 
of the Chairman of the Board during the absence or disability of the 
Chairman of the Board and prior to any action by the Board of Directors to 
fill any vacancy.  The Board of Directors may remove or replace the 
Chairman of the Board at any time and any vacancy in such position because 
of death, resignation, removal, disqualification or otherwise, may be 
filled by the Board of Directors for the unexpired portion of the term.

law the signature of such other officer is required, the  CEO shall possess 
the same power as such other officer to sign all certificates, contracts 
and other instruments and documents of the Corporation which may be 
authorized by the Board of Directors or otherwise, and shall possess the 
same power as such other officer to take any action authorized by these 
Bylaws or by the Board of Directors or otherwise.  He shall also perform

required), certificates for shares of the Corporation, any deeds, 
mortgages, bonds, contracts, and other instruments and documents which may 
be authorized by the Board of Directors or otherwise, except in cases where 
the signing and execution thereof shall be expressly delegated by the Board 
of Directors or by these Bylaws to some other officer or agent of the

forth in the third sentence of the first paragraph of Article V, Section 7, 
of these Bylaws.

the payment of money, payable to the Corporation or coming into his

all other funds of the Corporation, coming into his possession, in such 
banks as may be selected as the depositories of the Corporation, or 
properly care for them in such other manner as the Board of Directors may 
direct.  All checks and other instruments drawn on or payable out of the

unless such authority has been delegated by the Board of Directors, in 
which case, salaries shall be fixed by the person, persons or committee to 
whom authority has been delegated, subject to any limitations which may be 
contained in the resolution delegating such authority.  No officer shall be 
prevented from receiving such salary by reason of the fact that he or she 
is also a director of the Corporation.
	     Section 12.  Assistant Treasurers and Assistant Secretaries.  The CEO 
may appoint, from time to time, as he may see fit, and may (but shall not

of the Corporation shall be in such form as shall be determined by the 
Board of Directors.  Such certificates shall be signed by the CEO or 
President, and by the Treasurer or the Secretary.  Any or all of the 
signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile.  In case any officer, 
transfer agent, or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature 
has been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such officer, 
transfer agent, or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be 
issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, 
transfer agent, or registrar at the date of issue.  All certificates for 
shares shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise identified.  The name 
and address of the person to whom the shares represented thereby are 
issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on

the same and thereupon issue a new certificate or certificates therefor.  
Whenever a transfer is made for collateral security, and not absolutely, 
the fact shall be so expressed in the recording of the transfer.
	     Section 3.  Transfer Agent and Registrar.  The Board of Directors may 
appoint a transfer agent and registrar of transfers and thereafter may 
require all stock certificates to bear the signature of such transfer agent

agent or the registrar, but not both, may be a facsimile.
	     Section 4.  Registered Holder.  The Corporation shall be entitled to 
treat the registered holder of any shares as the absolute owner thereof

claim thereto, or interest therein, on the part of any other person, 
whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, save as 
expressly provided by the statutes of the State of Delaware.
	     Section 5.  Rules of Transfer.  The Board of Directors also shall have 
the power and authority to make all such rules and regulations as they may 
deem expedient concerning the issue, transfer and registration of the 
certificates for the shares of the Corporation.

shares of this Corporation to be lost or destroyed, shall make affidavit of 
the fact and lodge the same with the Secretary of the Corporation, 
accompanied by a signed application for a new certificate.  Such person 
shall give to the Corporation, to the extent deemed necessary by the 
Secretary or Treasurer, a bond of indemnity with one or more sureties 
satisfactory to the Secretary, and in an amount which, in his judgment, 
shall be sufficient to save the Corporation from loss, and thereupon the 
proper officer or officers may cause to be issued a new certificate of like 
tenor with the one alleged to be lost or destroyed.  But the Secretary may 
recommend to the Board of Directors that it refuse the issuance of such new 
certificate in the event that the applicable provisions of the Uniform 
Commercial Code are not met.

confined to specific instances.

Corporation and no evidences of indebtedness shall be issued in its name

mean personal notice, unless expressly stated so to be.  And any notice so 
required (other than notice by publication) may be given in writing by 
depositing the same in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to 
the shareholder, director or officer, at his, or her, address as the same

may, in writing, waive the giving and the mailing of any notice required to

the United States or by concurrent resolution of the Congress of the United 
States pursuant to Title 50, Appendix, Section 2291 of the United States 
Code, or any amendment thereof, or (b) upon a proclamation of a civil 
defense emergency by the Governor of the State of Illinois which relates to 
an attack or imminent attack on the United States or any of its 
possessions.  Such Emergency Bylaws, or any amendments to these Bylaws 
adopted during such emergency, shall cease to be effective and shall be 
suspended upon any proclamation by the President of the United States, or 
the passage by the Congress of a concurrent resolution, or any declaration 
by the Governor of Illinois that such civil defense emergency no longer 
exists.
	     Section 1.  Board of Directors' Meetings.  During any such emergency, 
any meeting of the Board of Directors may be called by any officer of the 
Corporation or by any director.  Notice shall be given by such person or by 
any officer of the Corporation.  The notice shall specify the place of the 
meeting, which shall be at the head office of the Corporation at the time 
if feasible, and otherwise, any other place specified in the notice.  The 
notice shall also specify the time of the meeting.  Notice may be given 
only to such of the directors as it may be feasible to reach at the time

and from time to time award to former members of the Board of Directors in 
recognition of their past distinguished service and contribution rendered 
to the Corporation the honorary title "Director Emeritus."  The award of 
this title shall not constitute an election or appointment to the Board of 
Directors, nor to any office of the Corporation, nor the bestowal of any 
duties, responsibilities or privileges associated therewith; and 
accordingly no "Director Emeritus" shall be deemed a "Director" as that 
term is used in these Bylaws.  The title "Director Emeritus" shall carry no 
compensation, and holders thereof shall not attend any meetings of the
