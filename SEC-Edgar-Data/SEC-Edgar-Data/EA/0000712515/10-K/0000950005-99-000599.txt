Item 1:  BUSINESS

Overview

         Electronic  Arts was initially  incorporated  in California in 1982. In
September 1991, we were reincorporated under the laws of Delaware. Our principal
executive  offices are  located at 209 Redwood  Shores  Parkway,  Redwood  City,
California 94065 and our telephone number is (650) 628-1500.

         We create, market and distribute interactive entertainment software for
a variety of hardware platforms. As of March 31, 1999, we marketed approximately
111 titles  developed  and/or  published  under one of our brand  names in North
America,  including older titles marketed as "Classics" or "Publisher's Choice."
Additionally,  we distribute localized versions of these products in the rest of
the world. We also distributed  approximately 21 additional  titles developed by
other software publishers  ("Affiliated Labels") in North America and over 1,000
Affiliated Label titles in the rest of the world.  Since our inception,  we have
developed products for 38 different computer hardware  platforms,  including the
following:  IBM PC-CD and  compatibles,  16-bit Sega Genesis  video game system,
16-bit  Super  Nintendo  Entertainment  System,  PlayStation,  Nintendo  64  and
PlayStation II. Our fiscal 1999 product releases were for PC-CD, PlayStation and
Nintendo  N64  cartridge  products.  As of March 31,  1999,  we were  developing
products for five different hardware platforms.

         Our product  development  methods and organization are modeled on those
used in the entertainment  industry. We also market our products with techniques
borrowed from other entertainment  companies such as record producers,  magazine
publishers and video  distributors.  Our employees called  "producers",  who are
each  responsible for the  development of one or more products,  oversee product
development  and  direct  teams  comprised  of both our  employees  and  outside
contractors.  Our designers regularly work with celebrities and organizations in
sports,  entertainment  and other areas to develop  products that provide gaming
experiences  that are as realistic and interactive as possible.  Celebrities and
organizations  with  whom we have had  contracts  include:  FIFA,  NASCAR,  John
Madden,  the National  Basketball  Association,  the PGA TOUR,  Tiger Woods, the
National Hockey League, World Championship  Wrestling Inc., Football Association
Premier League,  Formula One, and Sammy Sosa. We maintain development studios in
California, Canada, United Kingdom, Florida, Texas, Japan, Washington,  Maryland
and Nevada.

         We  invest  in the  creation  of  state-of-the-art  software  tools and
utilities that are then used in product development.  These tools allow for more
cost-effective  product  development and the ability to more efficiently convert
products from one hardware platform to another. We have also made investments in
facilities and equipment to facilitate the creation and editing of digital forms
of video and audio recordings and product  development  efforts for new hardware
platforms.

         We distribute our products and those of our Affiliated Labels primarily
by direct sales to retail chains and outlets in the United States and Europe. In
Japan and the Asia Pacific  region,  we  distribute  products  both  directly to
retailers  and through third party  distributors.  Our products are available in
over 58,000 retail

                                       3

locations worldwide. In fiscal 1999,  approximately 42% of our net revenues were
generated by international operations, compared to 43% in fiscal 1998 and 45% in
fiscal 1997.

Investments and Joint Ventures

         Acquisitions

         Westwood Studios

         In September  1998, we completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of  the  Irvine,   California-based  Virgin  Studios
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction  expenses.  The  transaction  was  accounted  for under the purchase
method.  Westwood has produced 13 titles in the past two years and is best known
for its successful PC-CD franchises,  Command and Conquer and Lands of Lore. See
note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item
8 hereof.

         ABC Software

         In July 1998,  we acquired  ABC Software  AG, in  Switzerland,  and ABC
Software GmbH, in Austria  (collectively  "ABC"),  independent  distributors  of
entertainment,   edutainment  and  application   software,   for   approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash acquired of  $5,099,000)  and $570,000 in other
consideration. The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method.
See note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated  Financial Statements,  included in
item 8 hereof.

         Joint Ventures

         In May 1998, Electronic Arts and Square Co., Ltd. ("Square"), a leading
developer  and  publisher  of  entertainment  software in Japan,  completed  the
formation  of two new joint  ventures,  in North  America  and  Japan.  In North
America,  the companies formed Square  Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which
has  exclusive  publishing  rights  in  North  America  for  future  interactive
entertainment  PlayStation  titles  created  by  Square.  We own a 30%  minority
interest in this joint venture while Square owns 70%. Additionally,  we have the
exclusive right to distribute in North America products  published by this joint
venture.

         In Japan,  the  companies  established  Electronic  Arts Square KK ("EA
Square KK"),  which  localizes and publishes in Japan our properties  originally
created in North America and Europe, as well as develops and publishes  original
video games in Japan. We own a 70% majority interest, while Square owns 30%. See
note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in item
8 hereof.

         Investments

         We have made  investments as part of our overall strategy and currently
hold minority equity interests in several companies,  including NovaLogic, Inc.,
Firaxis Software, Inc., Kodiak Inc., Pixel Inc. and The 3DO Company ("3DO").

Market

         Historically,  no hardware  platform or system has  achieved  long-term
dominance  in  the  interactive  entertainment  market.   Accordingly,  we  have
developed products at one time or another for 38 different  hardware  platforms.
In fiscal 1999,  Sony's  PlayStation was the dominant  hardware  platform in our
industry. In

                                       4

addition,  the installed base of  multimedia-enabled  home computers,  including
those with Internet  accessibility,  has continued to grow as Personal  Computer
("PC")  prices have  declined  and the  quality  and  choices of  software  have
increased dramatically.  We develop and publish products for multiple platforms,
and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of our strategy.

<TABLE>
         The following  table sets forth the year of release in North America of
each of the  hardware  platforms  for  which we have  published  titles  and the

         Sega launched  DreamcastTM in Japan in December 1998 and it is expected
to be released in North America in late calendar 1999.  Sega designed  Dreamcast
to combine features from the console and PC platforms.

         Sony is scheduled to launch  PlayStation  II in Japan in March 2000 and
the rest of the world starting in September 2000.  PlayStation II specifications
have been  announced  by Sony to be a 128-bit,  Digital  Versatile  Disk ("DVD")
based  system that is Internet and cable ready,  and  backward  compatible  with
PlayStation I software.

         Nintendo announced its plan for a next generation system to be released
in September 2000. Nintendo's new system will offer a DVD drive and have a modem
for Internet access.

         New  entrants  in  the   interactive   entertainment   and   multimedia
industries,  such as cable  television,  telephone  and  diversified  media  and
entertainment companies, and a proliferation of new technologies, such as online
networks and the Internet have increased the competition in the markets in which
we compete.  Our new product  releases in fiscal year 2000 will be primarily for
the IBM PC-CD and  compatibles,  PlayStation  and N64. We are also  scheduled to
release one or more online network gaming  products during fiscal 2000. See Risk
Factors - "New video game  platforms  create  additional  technical and business
model  uncertainties"  at page 25 and "The business  models and  technology  for
e-commerce and online gaming are unproven" at page 25.

         The early investment in products for the 32-bit market,  including both
Compact Disk personal computer  ("PC-CD") and CD-dedicated video game ("CD-video
game")  platforms,  has been  strategically  important in positioning us for the
current  generation  of  32-bit  and  64-bit  machines.  We  believe  that  such
investment   continues  to  be  important,   and  we  will  continue  aggressive
development  activities for 32-bit and 64-bit  platforms.  The  PlayStation  has
achieved significant market acceptance in all geographical territories, however,
as the PlayStation  console market matures,  we believe that its growth will not
continue at the present  rates.  In  addition,  our  revenues  and  earnings are
dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedule and our failure to
meet those  schedules  could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of
analysts'  expectations in any individual  quarter.  See Risk Factors - "Product
development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting  quarterly
results difficult" at page 25.

Competition

         See Risk Factors - "Our platform  licensors  are our chief  competitors
and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products" at page 26.

Relationships with Significant Hardware Platform Companies

         Sony

         In fiscal 1999, approximately 43% of our net revenues were derived from
sales of software for the  PlayStation  compared to 42% in fiscal  1998.  During
fiscal 1999,  we released 21  PlayStation  games  compared to 25 in fiscal 1998.
Among these releases were FIFA 99, World Cup 98 and Madden NFL 99. The volume of
sales of PlayStation products significantly  increased in fiscal 1999 due to the
increase in the installed base of PlayStation consoles worldwide and the quality
and timely release of our key franchise titles. Although revenues from the sales
of  PlayStation  products in fiscal 2000 are expected to continue to grow, we do
not  expect  to  maintain  these  growth  rates.  See Risk  Factors  -  "Product
development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting  quarterly
results difficult" at page 25.

         Under  the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony
Computer  Entertainment  of  America  in July 1994 (the  "Sony  Agreement"),  as
amended,  we are authorized to develop and distribute CD-based software products
compatible with the PlayStation.  Pursuant to the Sony Agreement, we engage Sony
to supply its  PlayStation  CDs for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have
limited  ability to control our supply of  PlayStation CD products or the timing
of their  delivery.  See Risk Factors - "Our  platform  licensors  are our chief
competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products"
at page 26.

         Nintendo

         During fiscal 1999, we released nine new titles for the N64 compared to
two titles in fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1999, approximately 12% of our net revenues
were  derived  from the sale of N64  products  compared to 6% in 1998.  In March
1997, we signed a licensing  agreement  with Nintendo (the "N64  Agreement")  to
develop, publish and market certain sports and other products for the N64. We do
not expect significant growth in revenues for N64 products in fiscal 2000.

         Under the terms of the N64 Agreement, we engage Nintendo to manufacture
our N64 cartridges for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability
to control  our supply of N64  cartridges  or the  timing of their  delivery.  A
shortage of  microchips  or other  factors  outside our control could impair our
ability to obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.

          In connection with our purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution in
North America,  Nintendo  requires us to provide  irrevocable  letters of credit
prior to Nintendo's acceptance of purchase orders from us for purchases of these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk. See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our
chief  competitors and frequently  control the  manufacturing  of our video game
products" at page 26.

Products and Product Development

         In fiscal 1999,  we generated  approximately  65% of our revenues  from
products  released  during the year.  See Risk  Factors -  "Product  development
schedules  are  frequently  unreliable  and make  predicting  quarterly  results
difficult"  at page  25.  As of  March  31,  1999,  we were  actively  marketing
approximately  111 titles,  comprising  approximately  193 stock  keeping  units
("sku's"),  that were published by our  development  divisions and  subsidiaries
("EA  Studios").  During fiscal 1999, we introduced  over 39 EA Studios  titles,
representing over 59 sku's, compared to 44 EA Studios titles, comprising over 71
sku's, in fiscal 1998.

         The  products  published  by EA Studios are designed and created by our
in-house   designers  and  artists  and  by  independent   software   developers
("independent  artists").  We typically pay the  independent  artists  royalties
based  on  the  sales  of the  specific  products,  as  defined  in the  related
independent artist agreements.

         For fiscal 1999 and 1998, no title  represented  revenues  greater than
10% of the total fiscal 1999 and 1998 net revenues.  For fiscal 1997, we had one
title,  Madden  Football `97,  published on five  platforms,  which  represented
approximately 10% of the total fiscal 1997 net revenues.

         We publish  products in a number of categories  such as sports,  action
and interactive movies, strategy,  simulations, role playing and adventure, each
of which is becoming  increasingly  competitive.  Our  sports-related  products,
marketed under the EA Sports brand name, accounted for a significant  percentage
of net revenues in fiscal years 1999 and 1998. There can be no assurance that we
will be able to maintain our market share in the sports category.

         The front line retail  selling prices in North America of our products,
excluding  older  titles  (marketed as  "Classics"  and  "Publisher's  Choice"),
typically  range from  $35.00 to $55.00.  "Classics"  and  "Publisher's  Choice"
titles have retail selling  prices that range from $10.00 to $30.00.  The retail
selling  prices of EA titles outside of North America vary based on local market
conditions.

         We currently  develop or publish  products for five different  hardware
platforms and have,  from time to time,  developed  and marketed  products on 38
different and  incompatible  platforms in the past. In fiscal 1999,  our product
releases were predominantly for PC-CD, 32-bit and 64-bit video game systems. Our
planned product  introductions  for fiscal 2000 are predominantly for the PC-CD,
PlayStation,  N64 as well as for  online  Internet  play.  See  Risk  Factors  -
"Product  development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make  predicting
quarterly  results  difficult" at page 25 and "New video game  platforms  create
additional technical and business model uncertainties" at page 25.

         As compact discs have emerged as the preferred  medium for  interactive
entertainment,  education, and information software, we continued our investment
in the  development  of  CD-ROM  tools and  technologies  in  fiscal  1999.  The
PlayStation  has  achieved  significant  market  acceptance  in  all  geographic
territories, however, as the PlayStation console market matures, we believe that
its growth will not continue at the present  rates.  Most of the  CD-video  game
products will be convertible for use on multiple advanced  hardware systems.  We
had  research and  development  expenditures  of $202.1  million in fiscal 1999,
$146.2  million in fiscal  1998,  and $130.8  million in fiscal  1997.  See Risk
Factors - "Product  development  schedules are  frequently  unreliable  and make
predicting quarterly results difficult" at page 25.

Marketing and Distribution

         We  distribute  both EA Studio  products  and  products  developed  and
published by other software publishers known as "Affiliated Labels."

         In  most  cases,  Affiliated  Label  products  are  delivered  to us as
completed  products.  As of March 31, 1999, we distributed  21 Affiliated  Label
titles in North  America and over 1,000  Affiliated  Label titles in the rest of
the world. No single  Affiliated Label Publisher has accounted for more than 10%
of our net revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.

         In May 1998,  Electronic  Arts and Square Co., Ltd.  formed a new joint
venture in North America,  creating Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA") as
discussed  in note 11 in the  Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,
included  in Item 8 hereof.  In  conjunction  with the  formation  of this joint
venture,  we will  have  the  exclusive  right in North  America  to  distribute
products  published by this joint venture.  In fiscal 1999,  Square EA published
Parasite  Eve  for  the  PlayStation,  which  was a top ten  selling  title  for
Electronic Arts and expects to release Final Fantasy 8 in fiscal 2000.

         In February  1998, we announced  that we entered into an  international
co-publishing  agreement  with  Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer  ("MGM") to be the exclusive
distributor of MGM Interactive  titles in all territories  except North America.
Under this agreement,  we will distribute such titles as Tomorrow Never Dies.

         We generated  approximately 90% of our North American net revenues from
direct sales to retailers  through a field sales  organization of  professionals
and a group of telephone sales  representatives.  The remaining 10% of our North
American sales were made through a limited  number of  specialized  and regional
distributors and rack jobbers in markets where we believe direct sales would not
be  economical.  For the fiscal year ended March 31,  1999,  we had sales to one
customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which represented 12% of total net revenues. We
had no sales to any one  customer in excess of 10% of total net revenues for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1998 and 1997.

         We are using the  Internet to market our  products,  build brand equity
and increase our understanding of our customers'  expectations.  We have various
EA websites  offering game tips, user bulletin  boards and matching  service for
head to head competition and tournaments.

         The  video  game and PC  businesses  have  become  increasingly  "hits"
driven,   requiring   significantly   greater  expenditures  for  marketing  and
advertising,  particularly for television advertising. There can be no assurance
that we will  continue to produce  "hit"  titles,  or that  advertising  for any
product will increase sales sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

         We have  stock-balancing  programs for our personal  computer  products
that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount,  allow for the
exchange of personal computer  products by resellers.  We also typically provide
for price  protection for our personal  computer and video game system  products
that,  under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price reduction from us
for unsold  products.  We  maintain a policy of  exchanging  products  or giving
credits, but do not give cash refunds. Moreover, the risk of product returns may
increase as new hardware  platforms  become more popular or market factors force
us to make changes in our distribution  system. We monitor and manage the volume
of our sales to retailers and distributors and their  inventories as substantial
overstocking  in the  distribution  channel  can  result in high  returns or the
requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent  periods.  We believe
that we provide  adequate  reserves for returns and price  protection  which are
based on estimated future returns of products,  taking into account  promotional

                                       8

<PAGE>


activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer
inventories  of our products and other  factors,  and that our current  reserves
will be sufficient to meet return and price protection  requirements for current
in-channel inventory.  However, there can be no assurance that actual returns or
price protection will not exceed our reserves.

         We also  have a  fulfillment  group  that  sells  product  directly  to
consumers  through  a  toll-free  number  and  through  our  websites  listed in
advertising by us and our Affiliated Labels.  This group is also responsible for
targeted  direct mail  marketing and sells product  backups and  accessories  to
registered customers.

         The distribution  channels through which consumer software products are
sold have been characterized by change,  including  consolidations and financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer  could render our accounts
receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could have an adverse effect on
our operating results and financial condition. In addition, an increasing number
of companies are competing for access to these channels.  Our arrangements  with
our  distributors  and  retailers  may be terminated by either party at any time
without cause. Distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with
ours.  Retailers of our products  typically have a limited amount of shelf space
and promotional  resources for which there is intense competition.  There can be
no assurance  that  distributors  and  retailers  will  continue to purchase our
products  or  provide  our  products  with  adequate  levels of shelf  space and
promotional support.

International Operations

         We have  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  throughout  the world,  including
offices in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany, Australia,  Canada, South
Africa,  Singapore,  Sweden, Japan, Malaysia, Brazil and Holland. The amounts of
net revenues,  operating profit and identifiable  assets attributable to each of
our geographic  regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set forth in
Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8
hereof.  International net revenues increased by 33% to $516,865,000,  or 42% of
consolidated  fiscal  1999 net  revenues,  compared to  $389,429,000,  or 43% of
consolidated  fiscal 1998 net  revenues.  Europe's  net  revenues  increased  by
$117,999,000  primarily  due to an  increase  in  sales  of  PlayStation  and AL
products.  Japan's net revenues  increased by  $11,371,000  primarily due to the
sales of FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98. Asia  Pacific net  revenues  decreased  by
$1,934,000  due to the weaknesses in Asian  currencies.  In local  currency,  in
spite of weak economies, net revenues for Asia Pacific increased compared to the
prior year.

         Though  international  revenues  are  expected to grow in fiscal  2000,
international  revenues  may not grow at as high a rate as in prior  years.  See
Risk Factors - "Our business,  our products, and our distribution are subject to
increasing  regulation  in key  territories"  at page 25 and "Foreign  Sales and
Currency Fluctuations" at page 26.

Manufacturing

         In  many   instances,   we  are  able  to   acquire   materials   on  a
volume-discount  basis.  We have multiple  potential  sources of supply for most
materials. Except with respect to our PlayStation and N64 products, we also have
alternate  sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of our products.  To
date, we have not experienced any material  difficulties or delays in production
of our software and related documentation and packaging.  However, a shortage of
components  or other  factors  beyond our  control  could  impair our ability to
manufacture,  or have  manufactured,  our  products.  See  Risk  Factors  - "Our
platform  licensors  are  our  chief  competitors  and  frequently  control  the
manufacturing of our video game products" at page 26.

Backlog

         We normally ship products  within a few days after receipt of an order.
However,  a backlog may occur for EA Studio and  Affiliated  Label products that
have been announced for release but not yet shipped.  We do not consider backlog
to be an indicator of future performance.

Seasonality

         Our business is highly  seasonal.  We typically  experience our highest
revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end holiday season and a seasonal low
in revenues  and profits in the quarter  ending in June.  In the June quarter of
our fiscal year 2000, we expect these seasonal trends to be magnified due to the
lack of significant  product releases during the quarter.  Additionally,  we had
exceptional  results for the same period in fiscal 1999 due to the  shipment and
success of World Cup 98.

Employees

         As of March 31, 1999, we employed  approximately  2,500 people, of whom
over 1,200  were  outside  the United  States.  We believe  that our  ability to
attract and retain qualified  employees is an important factor in our growth and
development  and that our future success will depend,  in large measure,  on our
ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees.  To date, we have
been  successful in recruiting  and  retaining  sufficient  numbers of qualified
personnel  to conduct our  business  successfully.  See Risk  Factors - "We face
intense  competition for talent from highly valued  Internet  companies" at page
26.

ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES

         Our  principal  administrative,   sales  and  marketing,  research  and
development,  and support facility is located in two modern buildings in Redwood
City, California,  20 miles south of San Francisco.  We moved into this facility
in October  1998.  We presently  occupy  approximately  350,000 sq. ft. in these
buildings under an operating lease for the buildings and certain  adjoining land
that will expire on December 1, 2001. Monthly lease payments vary based upon the
London  InterBank  Offered Rate. We have the option to purchase the property for
the  unamortized  financed  balance at any time after the  non-cancelable  lease
term, or we may terminate the lease at any time after the non-cancelable term by
arranging a third party sale or by making a termination  payment. In April 1999,
we exercised our option to purchase a parcel of land under the lease and sold it
to a third party.  The proceeds will  mitigate a portion of the occupancy  costs
for this facility.  Should we elect to terminate the lease,  we will guarantee a
residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized value of the property. As part of
the agreement, we must also comply with certain financial covenants.

         Our North American distribution is supported by a 54,000 sq. ft. leased
facility used as an office and warehouse in Hayward,  California,  and an 84,000
sq. ft.  warehouse  facility in Louisville,  Kentucky.  Effective April 1999, we
entered into a lease agreement that increases the Kentucky warehouse  facility's
square  footage  to  250,000  sq.  ft.  We  also  occupy  sales  offices  in the
metropolitan areas of Toronto, Chicago, Dallas and New York.

         In addition to our Redwood City  development  studio,  we own a 206,000
sq. ft.  development  facility in Burnaby,  British Columbia,  Canada and rent a
33,000 sq. ft.  facility in Seattle,  Washington.  The move to the new  Canadian
offices was  completed in June 1999.  We also own a 180,000 sq. ft.  development
facility  in Austin,  Texas and lease a 42,400 sq. ft.  development  facility in
Walnut Creek, California.

         Our  United  Kingdom  subsidiary  occupies   administrative  and  sales
facilities in Langley,  England, under a lease for a total of 44,000 sq. ft. and
a 22,000 sq. ft.  development  facility in Surrey,  England.  In Europe, we also
lease a distribution hub in Heerlen,  Holland and two  administrative  and sales
facilities in Germany, as well as sales and distribution  facilities in: Madrid,
Spain; Lyon, France;  Johannesberg,  South Africa; Neudorf,  Austria and Zurich,
Switzerland. Additionally, we have sales offices throughout Europe.

         In Asia and the South  Pacific,  we maintain a 5,500 sq. ft.  sales and
distribution   facility  in  Brisbane,   Australia.   We  also  have  sales  and
distribution  facilities in Singapore,  Malaysia and Taiwan,  and representative
offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai, China. We also maintain a 27,000 sq.
ft. sales and development office in Tokyo, Japan. See Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.

         We believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs. We
believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed
to accommodate our future needs.

ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         We are  subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after
review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the
disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.


ITEM 4: SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

         There were no matters  submitted to a vote of security  holders  during
the quarter ended March 31, 1999.

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The following  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations",  contains  forward looking  statements  regarding future
events or our  future  financial  performance  that  involve  certain  risks and
uncertainties  including  those discussed in "Risk Factors" at pages 25 to 26 of
this Annual  Report on Form 10-K.  Actual  events or actual  future  results may
differ  materially  from any forward  looking  statements  due to such risks and
uncertainties.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 1999 to 1998

                                 1999                  1998             % change
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net revenues                $1,221,863,000        $  908,852,000           34.4
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We derive revenues  primarily from shipments of  entertainment  software,  which
includes EA Studio CD products for  dedicated  entertainment  systems ("CD-video
games"), EA Studio CD personal computer products ("PC-CD"),  EA Studio cartridge
products  and  Affiliated  Label  ("AL")  products  that are  published by third
parties and  distributed  by us. We also derive  revenues  from  licensing of EA
Studio products and AL products through hardware  companies  ("OEMs") and online
subscription revenues.

Our total net  revenues  increased  compared to the prior year due to  increased
sales of products on PlayStation , Nintendo N64 , PC-CD and increased  worldwide
distribution of AL products. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in
sales of Sega Saturn(R) products and 16-bit video game products.

Sales of PlayStation  products in fiscal 1999 increased to $519,830,000,  or 43%
of total revenue,  compared to  $380,299,000,  or 42% of total revenue in fiscal
1998.  We released 21 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 1999  compared to 25 in
fiscal 1998.  The increase in sales was  attributable  to the greater  installed
base of  PlayStation  game  consoles  and the  releases  of key  titles for this
platform  including FIFA 99, World Cup 98 and Madden NFL 99. We expect  revenues
from  PlayStation  products to continue to grow in fiscal 2000,  but as revenues
for these products increase, we do not expect to maintain these growth rates.

Net revenues  derived from other 32-bit  products,  primarily  for Saturn,  were
$749,000 in fiscal 1999 compared to  $17,507,000  in fiscal 1998. We released no
new Saturn  titles in fiscal 1999  compared to eight in fiscal  1998.  We do not
expect to release  any new Saturn  titles in fiscal 2000 and  revenues  from the
sales of Saturn products are not expected to be significant in future years.

Net  revenues  from PC-CD  products  increased to  $270,793,000  in fiscal 1999,
representing 22% of total net revenues,  from $231,034,000,  or 25% of total net
revenues in fiscal 1998.  We released 29 PC-CD titles in fiscal 1999 compared to
30 PC-CD  titles  in  fiscal  1998.  The  worldwide  increase  in sales of PC-CD
products was primarily  attributable to an increase in sales in Europe and North
America due to the related  releases of key titles for this  platform  including
Sim City 3000.

Net revenues derived from N64 video game cartridge  products were  $152,349,000,
or 12% of total net revenues,  compared to  $56,677,000,  or 6%, in fiscal 1998.
The increase in N64 revenues was primarily  due to more title  releases for this
platform  compared to last year and a larger N64 market. We released nine titles
in fiscal 1999, including NASCAR 99,compared to two titles in fiscal 1998. We do
not expect significant growth in revenues for N64 products in fiscal 2000.

Net  revenues  from  shipments  of AL  products  in  fiscal  1999  increased  to
$248,105,000, or 20% of total revenue, compared to $185,865,000, or 20% of total
revenue in fiscal  1998.  The increase was due to higher sales of AL products in
North  America and Europe.  This  increase  was  primarily  attributable  to the
distribution  of  products  published  by  Square  EA in North  America  and the
acquisition of ABC Software in Switzerland.  We expect revenues from AL products
to continue to grow in fiscal 2000, but as revenues for these products increase,
we do not expect to maintain these growth rates.

Net  revenues  generated  by 16-bit  video game  cartridge-based  products  were
$635,000 in fiscal  1999,  compared  to  $17,314,000,  or 2% of net  revenues in
fiscal  1998.  As the 16-bit  video game market has been  replaced by 32-bit and
64-bit  systems,  we did not  release any new titles in fiscal  1999.  We do not
expect to release any new titles in fiscal 2000 and  revenues  from the sales of
16-bit products are not expected to be significant.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated  $17,788,000 in fiscal 1999,  compared
to  $15,431,000  in fiscal 1998.  The increase  was  primarily  the result of an
increase in the revenues generated by the licensing of our products in Europe.

North America net revenues  increased by 36% to  $704,998,000  in fiscal 1999 as
compared to $519,423,000 in fiscal 1998. The increase was mainly attributable to
strong growth in N64 and PlayStation  systems, the distribution of AL titles and
growth in PC-CD sales. Net revenues from PlayStation and N64 revenues  increased
$148,181,000  due to a larger  market  and  greater  installed  base  for  these
platforms  as well as more title  releases  for N64 in  comparison  to the prior
year. North America AL sales increased by

                                       17
<PAGE>


$39,813,000,  compared to the prior year  primarily due to the  distribution  of
products  published by Square EA. PC-CD revenues increased by $13,439,000 due to
key title releases during the year.

International  net  revenues  increased  by  33%  to  $516,865,000,  or  42%  of
consolidated fiscal 1999 net revenues,  compared to $389,429,000,  or 43% of the
fiscal 1998 total. Europe's net revenues increased by $117,999,000 primarily due
to an increase in sales of  PlayStation  and AL  products.  Japan's net revenues
increased by $11,371,000  primarily due to the sales of FIFA:  Road to World Cup
98. Asia Pacific net revenues  decreased  by  $1,934,000  due to the weakness in
Asian currencies.  In local currency,  in spite of weak economies,  net revenues
for Asia Pacific increased compared to the prior year.

Cost of goods sold               $625,547,000         $480,766,000          30.1

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cost of  goods  sold as a  percentage  of  revenues  decreased  in  fiscal  1999
primarily  due to  lower  artist  royalties,  including  savings  related  to an
acquisition  of a software  development  company  during fiscal 1999,  partially
offset by higher sales of lower margin N64 products.

The  increase in marketing  and sales  expenses was  primarily  attributable  to
increased print, Internet and television advertising to support new releases and
increased  cooperative  advertising  associated  with  higher  revenues in North
America and Europe as compared to the prior year.  Increases  in  marketing  and
sales  expenses were also due to additional  headcount  related to the continued
expansion of our worldwide  distribution  business and the  acquisitions  of ABC
Software and Westwood Studios.

The  increase in general and  administrative  expenses was  primarily  due to an
increase in headcount and  occupancy  costs to support the increase in growth in
North  America  and Europe  operations,  including  the  opening  of  additional
international offices in Europe and the acquisition of ABC Software.

The  increase  in  research  and  development  expenses  was  due to  additional
headcount-related  expenses attributable to the acquisition of Westwood Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of  the  Irvine,   California-based   Virgin  Studio
(collectively  "Westwood") in September 1998 and Tiburon Entertainment,  Inc. in
April 1998,  higher  development costs per title, as products are including more
content and are more complex and time  consuming to develop,  and an increase in
development costs for Ultima Online.

We released a total of 59 new  products in fiscal 1999  compared to 71 in fiscal
1998.

Amortization  of intangibles  results from the  acquisitions of Westwood and ABC
Software in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.

In connection  with the purchase of Westwood in September 1998, we allocated and
expensed  $41,836,000 of the $122,688,000  purchase price to in-process research
and development  projects.  This allocation  represents the estimated fair value
based on  risk-adjusted  cash  flows  related  to the  incomplete  research  and
development projects. At the date of acquisition,  this amount was expensed as a
non-recurring   charge  as  the  in-process   technology  had  not  yet  reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses. Westwood had three
major PC-CD projects in progress at the time of the acquisition including two in
the  best-selling  franchise  Command  and  Conquer  and  one in the  critically
acclaimed Lands of Lore series.  As of the acquisition  date,  costs to complete
the Westwood projects acquired were expected to be approximately $9.1 million in
fiscal 1999,  $10.6  million in fiscal 2000 and $1.0 million in fiscal 2001.  We
believe there have been no  significant  changes to these  estimates as of March
31, 1999. We currently  expect to complete the  development of these projects at
various dates

                                       18

<PAGE>


through fiscal 2001 and to publish the products upon completion.

The nature of the efforts required to develop the acquired in-process technology
into commercially  viable products  principally  relate to the completion of all
planning,  designing  and testing  activities  necessary to  establish  that the
product  can be produced to meet our design  requirements  including  functions,
features and technical performance requirements. Though we currently expect that
the acquired in-process technology will be successfully developed,  there can be
no assurance  that  commercial or technical  viability of these products will be
achieved.   Furthermore,  future  developments  in  the  entertainment  software
industry, changes in computer or video game console technology, changes in other
product  offerings or other  developments may cause us to alter or abandon these
plans.

The  value  assigned  to  purchased  in-process  technology  was  determined  by
estimating the completion  percentage of research and development efforts at the
acquisition date,  forecasting risk adjusted revenues considering the completion
percentage,  estimating  the  resulting  net cash  flows from the  projects  and
discounting  the  net  cash  flows  to  their  present  values.  The  completion
percentages  were  estimated  based on cost incurred to date,  importance of the
completed  development  tasks and the elapsed portion of the total project time.
The revenue projection used to value the in-process  research and development is
based on unit sales  forecasts for worldwide  sales  territories and adjusted to
consider only the revenue related to development  achievements  completed at the
acquisition  date. Net cash flow estimates include cost of goods sold and sales,
marketing and general and administrative  expenses and taxes forecasted based on
historical operating characteristics.  In addition, net cash flow estimates were
adjusted to allow for fair return on working  capital and fixed assets,  charges
for  franchise  and  technology   leverage  and  return  on  other  intangibles.
Appropriate risk adjusted  discount rates ranging from 20% to 22.5% were used to
discount  the net  cash  flows  back  to  their  present  value.  The  remaining
identified  intangibles  will be amortized on a straight-line  basis over two to
twelve years based on expected  useful lives of franchise  tradenames,  existing
products and technologies,  retention of workforce, and other intangible assets.
If these projects are not successfully  developed,  we may not realize the value
assigned to the in-process research and development projects.  In addition,  the
value of other acquired intangible assets may also become impaired.

In conjunction with the merger of Westwood, we accrued approximately  $1,500,000
related to direct  transaction  costs and other related  accruals.  At March 31,
1999, there were $725,000 in accruals remaining related to these items.

Additionally,   for  fiscal  1999,  the  charge  for  in-process   research  and
development  also  included   write-offs  of  $2,279,000   associated  with  the
acquisition of two software development companies in the first quarter.

For fiscal 1998,  we incurred a charge of  $1,500,000  for  acquired  in-process
technology  in  connection  with the  acquisition  of the remaining 35% minority
ownership interest in Electronic Arts Victor, Inc. in December 1997. This charge
was made after we concluded  that the  in-process  technology had no alternative
future  use after  taking  into  consideration  the  potential  for usage of the
software in different products and resale of the software.

On July 25,  1997,  we  completed  a  merger  with  Maxis,  Inc.  ("Maxis").  In
conjunction  with the merger,  we recorded costs of  $10,792,000  which included
direct  transaction fees and costs associated with integrating the operations of
the two companies.  At March 31, 1999, there were no accruals  remaining related
to these merger costs.

Operating  income  increased due to higher net revenues and related gross profit
partially  offset by  increased  operating  expenses  including  the charges for
acquired  in-process  technology  of  $44,115,000  in the  current  fiscal  year
partially  offset by  merger  costs of  $10,792,000  and a charge  for  acquired
in-process  technology of $1,500,000  related to the  acquisitions  in the prior
fiscal year.

The decrease in interest and other income,  net, was primarily  attributable  to
the sale of our 50%  ownership  interest  in Creative  Wonders,  LLC in December
1997. The sale resulted in a gain in the prior year of $12,625,000.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was  negatively  affected as there was no
tax  benefit  recorded  for a portion of the  charges  related  to the  acquired
in-process technology.  Excluding the effect of these charges, the effective tax
rate for the  current  fiscal  year would have been 32.0% as compared to a 33.0%
tax rate in the  corresponding  prior  year  periods.  The  lower  rate of 32.0%
results  primarily  from a higher portion of  international  income subject to a
lower foreign tax rate as

                                       19

In the first  quarter  of fiscal  1999,  we formed EA Square KK which is seventy
percent owned by us and thirty  percent owned by Square Co. Ltd.  ("Square"),  a
leading  developer and publisher of  entertainment  software in Japan.  Minority
interest for fiscal 1999  represents  Square's 30% interest in the net income of
EA Square KK.

For  fiscal  1998,  the  minority  interest  represented  the  35%  interest  in
Electronic Arts Victor, Inc. ("EAV") owned by Victor  Entertainment  Industries,
Inc. ("VEI").  We acquired the remaining 35% minority  ownership interest in EAV
held by VEI in December 1997.

Reported net income was flat due to the one-time charges related to acquisitions
offsetting  significantly  higher operating income.  The increase in net income,
excluding one-time charges, was due to higher revenues and gross profits, offset
by higher  operating  expenses.  For fiscal 1998, net income included a one-time
gain on sale of Creative Wonders, LLC in the amount of $8,459,000, net of taxes,
offset by Maxis merger costs and a charge for acquired  in-process  developments
of  $8,236,000,  net of taxes.  For fiscal 1999,  net income  included  one-time
charges  for  acquired  in-process  technology  of  $37,506,000,  net of  taxes.
Excluding  one-time items in both years, as noted above, net income increased to
$110,378,000 from $72,339,000, or 53% over the prior year.

Net revenues                     $908,852,000         $673,028,000          35.0
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Our total net  revenues  increased  compared to the prior year due to  increased
sales of PlayStation products,  increased worldwide distribution of AL products,
sales of N64 video game  cartridge  products and sales of PC-CD  products.  This
increase  was  partially  offset by a  decrease  in sales of 16-bit  video  game
cartridges and License/OEM revenues.

Net revenues from 32-bit CD-video game products,  primarily for the PlayStation,
were  $397,806,000  in fiscal 1998,  representing  44% of the total net revenues
compared  to  $225,875,000,  or 34% of total net  revenues in fiscal  1997.  The
increase in sales of 32-bit video game products was  attributable to the greater
installed base of PlayStation  game consoles and related  releases of key titles
for this platform  during the year offset by a decline in revenues from sales of
products for Saturn.

Sales of PlayStation  products in fiscal 1998 increased to $380,299,000,  or 42%
of total revenue,  compared to  $187,531,000,  or 28% of total revenue in fiscal
1997.  We released 25 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 1998  compared to 14 in
fiscal 1997.

Net revenues  derived from the sales of other 32-bit  products,  primarily  from
Saturn,  were $17,507,000 in fiscal 1998 compared to $38,344,000 in fiscal 1997.
As the  installed  base of Saturn  consoles  did not achieve the growth rates of
PlayStation  consoles,  our revenues from sales of Saturn products declined.  We
released eight new Saturn titles in fiscal 1998 compared to 12 in fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  from  shipments  of AL  products  in  fiscal  1998  increased  to
$185,865,000,  or 20% of total revenue, compared to $96,696,000, or 14% of total
revenue in fiscal 1997.  This increase was due to higher sales of AL products in
North America,  Europe and Asia Pacific.  This increase was  attributable to the
product  releases  under  a  worldwide  exclusive  distribution  agreement  with
DreamWorks  Interactive,  including The Lost World:  Jurassic  Park,  and due to
continued distribution of products from Accolade, Inc. which began in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1997. AL revenues also  increased as a result of our exclusive
distribution  agreement with Twentieth  Century Fox Home  Entertainment  outside
North America.

Net revenues derived from N64 video game cartridge products were $56,677,000, or
6% of total net revenues,  compared to  $17,804,000  in fiscal 1997. We released
two titles in fiscal 1998 compared to one title in fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  from PC-CD  products  increased to  $231,034,000  in fiscal 1998,
representing 25% of total net revenues,  from $216,338,000,  or 32% of total net
revenues in fiscal 1997.  We released 30 PC-CD titles in fiscal 1998 compared to
32 PC-CD  titles in fiscal  1997.  The  increase in sales of PC-CD  products was
attributable  to the worldwide  growth in the PC market and the expansion of our
direct distribution worldwide.  PC-CD sales growth for fiscal 1998 was partially
offset by a decline in titles  published  by Maxis.  Maxis'  PC-CD  revenues for
fiscal 1998 decreased by $17,010,000 or 45% compared to fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  generated  by 16-bit  video game  cartridge-based  products  were
$17,314,000, or 2% of total revenues in fiscal

                                       20

1998, compared to $89,160,000, or 13% of net revenues in fiscal 1997.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated  $15,431,000 in fiscal 1998,  compared
to  $26,749,000  in fiscal  1997.  The decrease  was  primarily  the result of a
decrease in the revenues  generated  by the  licensing of our products in Europe
and Japan.

North America net revenues  increased by 39% to  $519,423,000  in fiscal 1998 as
compared to $372,616,000 in fiscal 1997. The increase was mainly attributable to
strong  growth in  PlayStation  and N64  systems as well as AL product  revenues
partially  offset by the decline in 16-bit  cartridge and Saturn  product sales.
Net revenues from  PlayStation  and N64 products  increased  $172,496,000  while
sales  of  16-bit  cartridge  and  Saturn  products  decreased   $62,671,000  in
comparison  to the prior year.  North  America AL sales  increased  $34,355,000,
compared to the prior year.

International  net  revenues  increased  by  30%  to  $389,429,000,  or  43%  of
consolidated fiscal 1998 net revenues,  compared to $300,412,000,  or 45% of the
fiscal 1997 total.  The  increase in  international  revenues  was due to higher
worldwide sales of PlayStation products and increased sales of PC-CD, N64 and AL
products in Europe and Asia Pacific.  This was partially offset by a decrease in
32-bit  product  sales in  Japan,  international  16-bit  video  game  cartridge
revenues and licensing of our products.

The  increase in marketing  and sales  expenses was  primarily  attributable  to
increased television and print advertising to support new releases and increased
cooperative advertising associated with higher revenues as compared to the prior
year.  Increases in marketing  and sales  expenses  were also due to  additional
headcount  related to the  continued  expansion  of our  worldwide  distribution
business.

The  increase in general and  administrative  expenses was  primarily  due to an
increase  in  payroll  and  occupancy  costs due to the  opening  of  additional
international offices and additional depreciation related to the installation of
new management information systems worldwide. This increase was partially offset
by lower spending in Japan.

The  increase  in  marketing  and sales as well as  general  and  administrative
expenses were partially  offset by savings  attributable  to the  integration of
Maxis in the second quarter of fiscal 1998.

The  increase  in  research  and  development  expenses  was  due to  additional
headcount related expenses in North America and Europe attributable to increased
in-house development capacity, higher development costs per title and additional
depreciation of computer equipment.

We released a total of 71 new  products in fiscal 1998  compared to 68 in fiscal
1997.

In connection  with the  acquisition  of the  remaining  35% minority  ownership
interest  in EAV in  December  1997,  we  incurred  a charge of  $1,500,000  for
acquired in-process technology. This charge was made after we concluded that the
in-process   technology  had  no  alternative   future  use  after  taking  into
consideration the potential for usage of the software in different  products and
resale of the software.

On July 25, 1997,  we  completed a merger with Maxis.  In  conjunction  with the
merger, we recorded costs of $10,792,000 which included direct  transaction fees
and costs associated with integrating the operations of the two companies.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operating  income  increased due to higher net revenues and related gross profit
partially  offset by  increased  operating  expenses  including  the  charge for
acquired  in-process   technology  as  well  as  merger  costs  related  to  the
acquisition of Maxis.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The  increase  in other  income  is  primarily  due to  higher  interest  income
attributable  to higher cash  balances as compared to the previous  year and the
sale of our 50% ownership  interest in Creative  Wonders,  LLC in December 1997.
The sale of Creative  Wonders  resulted in a gain of $12,625,000.  This increase
was  partially  offset by lower gains on sales of  marketable  securities in the
amount of $4,098,000 compared to $8,393,000 in the prior year.

Effective tax rate                    33.0%              34.2%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our effective tax rate was lower for the year as a result of a higher proportion
of  international  income subject to a lower foreign tax rate as compared to the
prior year and the  reinstatement  of the federal  research and  development tax
credit for the full fiscal year 1998.

As discussed above, we acquired the remaining minority ownership interest in EAV
in December 1997. Prior to the acquisition,  EAV was sixty-five percent owned by
us and  thirty-five  percent  owned  by VEI.  Minority  interest  for  the  year
reflected  only a portion  of  reported  losses for EAV as the net equity of EAV
fell below zero in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.

The increase in net income was due to the growth in revenues  and gross  margins
offset by higher operating expenses.  The impact of the gain on sale of Creative
Wonders,  LLC was offset by the charge for acquired  in-process  technology  and
merger costs.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of  March  31,  1999,  our  working  capital  was  $333,256,000  compared  to
$408,098,000  at  March  31,  1998.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments decreased by approximately  $61,738,000 in fiscal 1999. We generated
$150,768,000  of cash from  operations in fiscal 1999. In addition,  $30,577,000
was provided through the sale of equity securities under our stock plans.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from $51,575,000 at March 31,
1998 to $72,850,000 at March 31, 1999. Reserves have been charged for returns of
product and price protection  credits issued for products sold in prior periods.
Management  believes these reserves are adequate based on historical  experience
and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances.

   During fiscal 1999, we invested  $122,688,000  in cash for the acquisition of
Westwood  Studios,  Inc.,  $9,466,000  for  the  acquisition  of  ABC  Software,
approximately   $7,800,000  for  investment  in  affiliates  and   approximately
$8,000,000  in  long-term  licenses.  In  addition,  we  invested  approximately
$78,800,000  for new facilities in Europe and Canada and $17,800,000 in computer
equipment  worldwide.  In addition,  we repurchased 222,500 shares of our common
stock for approximately $9,001,000.

   Our principal  source of liquidity is $312,822,000 in cash, cash  equivalents
and  short-term  investments.   Management  believes  the  existing  cash,  cash
equivalents,  short-term  investments,  marketable securities and cash generated
from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and investment  requirements for
the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.

YEAR 2000 READINESS DISCLOSURE

Background of Year 2000 Issues

   Many currently installed computer systems and software products are unable to
distinguish  between  twentieth  century  dates and  twenty-first  century dates
because such systems may have been  developed  using two digits rather than four
to determine  the  applicable  year.  For example,  computer  programs that have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than  the  year  2000.   This  error   could   result  in  system   failures  or
miscalculations  causing  disruptions  of  operations,  including,  among  other
things, a temporary inability to process  transactions,  send invoices or engage
in similar normal business activities. As a result, many companies' software and
computer  systems  may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such "Year
2000" requirements.

State of Readiness

   Our  business is dependent  on the  operation of numerous  systems that could
potentially be impacted by Year 2000 related  problems.  Those systems  include,
among  others:  hardware  and software  systems used to deliver  products to our
customers;  communications  networks such as the Internet and private intranets,
which we depend on to  receive  orders  for  products  from our  customers;  the
internal systems of our customers and suppliers; products sold to customers; the
hardware and software systems used internally in the management of our business;
and  non-information  technology  systems and services used in the management of
our business, such as power, telephone systems and building systems.

   Based on an  analysis  of the  systems  potentially  impacted  by  conducting
business  in the  twenty-first  century,  we are  applying a phased  approach to
making such systems, and accordingly,  our operations,  ready for the year 2000.
Beyond  awareness  of the issues and scope of  systems  involved,  the phases of
activities in progress include:  an assessment of specific  underlying  computer
systems, programs and hardware; renovation,  replacement or redeployment of Year
2000  non-compliant  technology;   validation  and  testing  of  technologically
compliant Year 2000  solutions;  and  implementation  of the Year 2000 compliant
systems.

   As a  third  party  providing  software  products,  we are  dependent  on the
hardware and software  products used to deliver such  products and services.  If
such products are  inoperable due to Year 2000 issues,  our business,  financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. An inventory of
our  internal  business  systems has been  completed  and planned  software  and
hardware upgrades to ensure Year 2000 compliance are in process. The upgrades to
these systems are expected to be completed by June, 1999.

Costs

   To date we have not incurred  significant costs directly related to Year 2000
issues,  even in cases where non-compliant  information  technology systems were
redeployed or replaced.

   We  believe  that  future   expenditures  to  upgrade  internal  systems  and
applications will not have a material adverse effect on our business,  financial
condition  and  results of  operations  and are  primarily  included  within our
ongoing  system  development  plan. In addition,  while the  potential  costs of
redeploying  personnel and of any delays in implementing  other projects are not
known, the costs are anticipated to be immaterial.

                                       23

Risks of the Year 2000 Issues

     Our financial  information  systems include an integrated suite of business
applications  developed and supported by Oracle Corporation.  These applications
systems are in place and currently support daily operations in the United States
and in Europe.  Based on representations made by Oracle Corporation and upon our
limited tests, we believe these systems to be Year 2000 compliant.

     We believe our software products are Year 2000 compliant;  however, success
of our Year 2000  compliance  efforts may depend on the success of our customers
dealing with their Year 2000 issues. Customer difficulties with Year 2000 issues
might require us to devote additional  resources to resolve underlying problems.
Failures of our and/or third  parties'  computer  systems  could have a material
adverse impact on our ability to conduct  business.  For example,  a significant
percentage of purchase orders received from our customers are computer generated
and  electronically  transmitted.  In  addition,  the Year 2000 could affect the
ability of consumers to use our PC based  products.  If the computer  systems on
which  the  consumers  use  our  products  are not  Year  2000  compliant,  such
noncompliance could affect the consumers' ability to use such products.

Contingency Plans

     We continue to assess  certain of our Year 2000 exposure  areas in order to
determine what additional  steps beyond those  identified by our internal review
in the United States are  advisable.  We are currently  developing a contingency
plan for handling Year 2000  problems that are not detected and corrected  prior
to their occurrence.  We expect this plan will be completed by June 30, 1999. We
believe that the systems,  which  represent the principal  exposures,  have been
identified, and to the extent necessary, are in the process of being modified to
become Year 2000  compliant.  Additionally,  we will be conducting  tests of our
principal business systems to verify that those systems are Year 2000 compliant.
Any failure to address any unforeseen Year 2000 issue could adversely affect our
business, financial condition and results of operations.


EURO CONVERSION

     On January 1, 1999,  eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European
Union established fixed conversion rates between their existing  currencies (the
"legacy  currency") and the one common legal currency known as the "Euro".  From
January 1, 1999  through June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their
legacy  currencies  or the Euro to transact  business.  By July 1, 2002,  at the
latest,  the  conversion  to the Euro will be  complete at which time the legacy
currencies  will no  longer be legal  tender.  The  conversion  to the Euro will
eliminate currency exchange rate risk between the member countries.

     We do not  anticipate any material  impact from the Euro  conversion on our
financial  information systems which currently  accommodate multiple currencies.
Computer  software  changes  necessary  to comply  with the Year 2000  issue are
generally compliant to the Euro conversion issue. Due to numerous uncertainties,
we cannot  reasonably  estimate the effect that the Euro  conversion  issue will
have on our pricing or market  strategies,  and the impact, if any, it will have
on our financial condition and results of operations.

RISK FACTORS

     EA's business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties  which may affect
our  future   financial   performance.   Some  of  those   important  risks  and
uncertainties  which  may  cause  our  operating  results  to vary or which  may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows:

- - Product  development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting
quarterly results difficult. Product development schedules, particularly for new
hardware platforms and high-end  multimedia PCs are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms
and  the  learning  process,   research  and  experimentation   associated  with
development  for new  technologies.  For example,  SimCity  3000,  the follow on
product to SimCity 2000, was expected to ship in fiscal 1998, at the time of the
merger with Maxis. Due to additional  development  delays,  that product did not
ship until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. Also, Tiberian Sun, which was
expected  to ship in  fiscal  1999 at the time of the  acquisition  of  Westwood
Studios,  is not expected to be released until the second quarter of fiscal 2000
due to development delays.  Additionally,  development risks for CD-ROM products
can cause particular  difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter.  Our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to
meet our product  release  schedules,  and our  failure to meet those  schedules
could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts' expectations
for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

- - New video game  platforms  create  additional  technical  and  business  model
uncertainties.  A large  portion of our  revenues  are derived  from the sale of
products for play on proprietary  video game  platforms such as the  PlayStation
and the N64. The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance
of the new video  game  hardware  systems  and the life  span of older  hardware
platforms and our ability to accurately  predict  which  platforms  will be most
successful.

Sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed
for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large  installed  bases or
will continued  product  development for older hardware  platforms that may have
shorter  life cycles than we  expected.  Conversely,  if we do not develop for a
platform that achieves significant market acceptance, or discontinue development
for a platform that has a longer life cycle than  expected,  our revenue  growth
may be adversely affected.

For  example,  while the Sega  Dreamcast  console is  scheduled to launch in the
United States in late calendar 1999 and has already  launched in Japan,  we have
no products under development for this platform.  Accordingly,  we will not have
products   available  should  this  platform  achieve  wide  market  acceptance.
Similarly,  we  intend  to  launch  a  variety  of  products  for the  new  Sony
PlayStation platform,  the PlayStation II, expected to be released in the Untied
States in September  2000.  Should that platform not achieve wide  acceptance by
consumers,  we will have spent a  disproportionate  amount of our  resources for
this platform.  Additionally,  we have not negotiated publishing agreements with
Sony, Sega or Nintendo for their next generation  platforms,  and we do not know
whether the terms of those agreements will be favorable.

- - The  business  models and  technology  for  e-commerce  and online  gaming are
unproven.  While we do not  currently  derive  significant  revenues from online
sales of our packaged products or from games played online, we believe that both
will become a more  significant  factor in our business  and in the  interactive
gaming business generally in the future.

E-commerce is becoming an  increasingly  popular method for conducting  business
with consumers.  How that form of distribution  will affect the more traditional
retail distribution,  at which we have historically excelled, and over what time
period, is uncertain.  Additionally,  technology, staffing and support for sales
direct to consumers differ from that required for sales to resellers.

Online gaming,  and  particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as our Ultima
Online product,  has many risks not currently associated with most packaged good
sales including, but not limited to, the following:

     In  "massively  multiplayer"  games  such as Ultima  Online,  unanticipated
player  conduct  significantly  affects the  performance of the game, and social
issues raised by players' conduct frequently determine player satisfaction.  Our
ability to effectively proctor such games is uncertain.

     The current business model is as yet experimental and maybe  unsustainable;
whether  revenues will  continue to be  sufficient  to maintain the  significant
support,  service and product  enhancement demands of online users is uncertain.
We  have  little  experience  in  pricing  strategies  for  online  games  or in
predicting usage patterns of our customers.

     Additionally, the speed and reliability of the Internet and the performance
of a user's Internet  service  provider are not controlled by us but impact both
e-commerce and online game performance. Whether the Internet infrastructure will
be  adequate  to meet  increasing  demand  will  affect our  ability to grow our
Internet dependent businesses.

- - Our business,  our products,  and our  distribution  are subject to increasing
regulation in key territories.  Legislation is increasingly introduced which may
affect the content of our products and their distribution.  For example, privacy
rules in the United States and Europe  impose  various

                                       25

<PAGE>


restrictions on our web sites. Those rules vary by territory while of course the
Internet recognizes no geographical boundaries.  Other countries such as Germany
have adopted laws  regulating  content  transmitted  over the Internet  that are
stricter than current United States laws. In the United  States,  in response to
recent events, the federal and several state governments are considering content
restrictions  on products  such as those made by us as well as  restrictions  on
distribution  of such products.  Any one or more of these factors could harm our
business.

- - Our platform  licensors are our chief  competitors and frequently  control the
manufacturing  of  our  video  game  products.   Our  agreements  with  hardware
licensors,  which are also our chief  competitors,  typically  give  significant
control to the licensor  over the approval and  manufacturing  of our  products.
This fact could, in certain  circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products
approved,  manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events, control of the
approval and manufacturing  process by the platform licensors increases both our
manufacturing  lead  times  and  costs  as  compared  to  those  we can  achieve
independently.  For example,  in prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining
approvals for and  manufacturing of PlayStation  products which caused delays in
shipping  those  products.  The  potential  for  additional  delay or refusal to
approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors.  Such
occurrences   would  harm  our  business  and  adversely  affect  our  financial
performance.

- - We face intense  competition for talent from highly valued Internet companies.
Competition for employees in the interactive  software business  continues to be
intense. Recently, the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining key
employees is from Internet companies.  The high market valuations,  large equity
positions  for  key  executives  and  creative   talent  and  fast  stock  price
appreciation of these companies make their compensation  packages  attractive to
those who are already working in more mature  companies.  This situation creates
difficulty  for us to compete for the  attraction and retention of executive and
key creative talent.


- - Foreign Sales and Currency  Fluctuations.  For fiscal 1999,  international net
revenues  comprised 42% of total  consolidated  net revenues.  We expect foreign
sales to  continue  to account  for a  significant  and  growing  portion of our
revenues. Such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements,  tariffs
and other  barriers.  Additionally,  foreign sales are  primarily  made in local
currencies which may fluctuate.  As a result of current  economic  conditions in
Asia,  we are subject to  additional  foreign  currency  risk.  Though we do not
currently  derive a significant  portion of revenues and operating  profits from
sales in Asia and other developing countries,  our foreign currency exposure may
increase as operations in these countries grow and if current economic trends in
Asia continue. Any of these factors may significantly harm our business.

- - Fluctuations in Stock Price. Due to analysts' expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given
period.  As a result of the factors  discussed in this report and other  factors
that may arise in the future,  the market price of our common stock historically
has been,  and may  continue to be subject to  significant  fluctuations  over a
short period of time.  These  fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us,
to  changes  in  analysts'  earnings  estimates,  or to  factors  affecting  the
computer,  software,  entertainment,  media  or  electronics  industries  or the
securities  markets in general.  For example,  during the fiscal year 1999,  the
price per share of our common  stock  ranged from  $33.88 to $56.00.  During the
fiscal year 1998,  the price per share of our common stock ranged from $20.13 to
$46.94.

Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk

     We are exposed to various  market  risks,  including the changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates and interest  rates.  Market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and short-term  investments are subject to
market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to
interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies thereby limiting our risk. Gains and
losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.  At
March 31, 1999, we had foreign exchange  contracts,  all with maturities of less
than nine  months to purchase  and sell  approximately  $178,178,000  in foreign
currencies,  primarily British Pounds,  Canadian Dollars,  German  Deutschmarks,
Japanese Yen and other European currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate,  plus the  unamortized  premium or discount.  At March 31,
1999, fair value of these contracts is not significant.  The  counterparties  to
these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks.
The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not
considered  to be  material.  Notwithstanding  our  efforts  to  manage  foreign
exchange  risks,  there can be no assurances  that our hedging  activities  will
adequately  protect  us  against  the risks  associated  with  foreign  currency
fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts  at March  31,  1999.  The  information  is  provided  in U.S.  dollar
equivalents  and presents the notional  amount  (forward  amount),  the weighted
average  contractual  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  fair  value.  All
contracts mature within nine months.

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our  investments  to maturity.  At March 31, 1999,
our  cash  equivalents,  short-term  and  long-term  investments  included  debt
securities of $224,581,000.  Notwithstanding our efforts

                                       27

to  manage  interest  rate  risks,  there can be no  assurances  that we will be
adequately   protected   against  the  risks   associated   with  interest  rate
fluctuations.

ITEM 8:  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The Report of Independent Auditors,  Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements follow below on pages 29 through 47.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Electronic Arts Inc. and Subsidiaries:


We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts
Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as  of  March  31,  1999  and  1998,  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended March 31, 1999. These  consolidated
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We did not audit the  financial  statements of
Maxis,  Inc.,  a  company  acquired  by  Electronic  Arts  Inc.  in  a  business
combination  accounted  for as a pooling of interests as described in Note 11 to
the consolidated  financial statements,  which statements reflect total revenues
constituting  7% for the year ended March 31, 1997, of the related  consolidated
totals.  Those  statements  were audited by other auditors whose report has been
furnished to us, and our opinion,  insofar as it relates to the amounts included
for Maxis, Inc., is based solely on the report of the other auditors.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  based on our audits and the report of the other  auditors,  the
consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all
material   respects,   the  financial  position  of  Electronic  Arts  Inc.  and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year  period ended March
31, 1999, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

ELECTRONIC ARTS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997


(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Electronic Arts Inc. and its wholly-owned and  majority-owned  subsidiaries (the
"Company").  All significant  intercompany  balances and transactions  have been
eliminated in consolidation.

     A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company follows:

(a)  Fiscal Year
The  Company's  fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week  period that ends on the
Saturday  nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
1999,  1998 and 1997 contain 52 weeks.  Since the results of an additional  week
are not material, and for clarity of presentation herein, all fiscal periods are
treated as ending on a calendar month end.

(b)  Revenue Recognition
The  Company's  revenue  recognition  policies are in  compliance  with American
Institute of Certified  Public  Accountants  Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition",  and SOP 98-4 "Deferral of the Effective Date of
a  Provision  of  SOP  97-2",  which  provide  guidance  on  generally  accepted
accounting principles for recognizing revenue on software transactions. SOP 97-2
requires that revenue recognized from software arrangements be allocated to each
element of the  arrangement  based on the relative  fair values of the elements.
The Company has adopted the  provisions  of these SOPs as of April 1, 1998.  The
adoption  has, in certain  circumstances,  resulted  in the  deferral of certain
revenues  associated  with the  Company's  sales  promotions  and products  with
multiple deliverable elements. Neither the changes in certain business practices
nor the deferral of certain  revenues have resulted in a material  impact on the
Company's  operating  results,  financial  position or cash flows for the period
ended  March 31,  1999.  Total  deferred  revenue at March 31, 1999 and 1998 was
$8,206,000, and $2,797,000, respectively.

Product  Sales:  Revenue is  generally  recognized  when the product is shipped.
Subject  to  certain  limitations,  the  Company  permits  customers  to  obtain
exchanges  within certain  specified  periods and provides  price  protection on
certain  unsold  merchandise.  Revenue is  recognized  net of an  allowance  for
returns and price protection.

Online  Subscription   Revenues:   Monthly  online  subscription   revenues  are
recognized over the period in which the services are provided.

Software Licenses: For those agreements which provide the customers the right to
multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed  minimum royalty amounts,  revenue is
recognized  at  delivery  of the  product  master  or the first  copy.  Per copy
royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Revenue  from the  licensing  of  software  was  $17,788,000,  $15,431,000,  and
$26,749,000  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

(c) Cash and Investments
Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with  insignificant rate
risk  and  with  maturities  of three  months  or less at the date of  purchase.
Short-term  investments  include  securities with maturities  greater than three
months  and less than one year,  except  for  certain  investments  with  stated
maturities greater than one year.  Long-term  investments  consist of securities
with maturities greater than one year.

The Company  accounts for investments  under  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  115,  "Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in Debt and Equity
Securities,"  ("SFAS 115").  The Company's policy is to protect the value of its
investment  portfolio and to minimize principal risk by earning returns based on
current interest rates. Management determines the appropriate  classification of
its debt and equity  securities  at the time of purchase  and  reevaluates  such
designation  as of each balance sheet date.  Debt  securities  are classified as
held-to-maturity  when the Company has the  positive  intent and ability to hold
the  securities  to maturity.  Securities  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are
carried at amortized  cost,  which is adjusted for  amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity.  Such  amortization  is included in interest
income. Debt securities,  not classified as held-to-maturity,  are classified as
available-for-sale and  are  stated at fair value.  Securities  sold is based on
the specific identification method.

(d)  Prepaid Royalties
Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties are expensed at the contractual royalty rate as cost of

                                       34

<PAGE>


goods sold based on actual net product  sales.  Management  evaluates the future
realization  of prepaid  royalties  quarterly  and charges to income any amounts
that management  deems unlikely to be realized  through  product sales.  Royalty
advances are classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon estimated
net  product  sales for the  following  year.  The  current  portion  of prepaid
royalties,  included in other current assets, was $35,057,000 and $20,470,000 at
March  31,  1999 and  1998,  respectively.  The  long-term  portion  of  prepaid
royalties,  included in other assets, was $7,602,000 and $2,289,000 at March 31,
1999 and 1998, respectively.

(e)  Software Development Costs
Research and development costs, which consist primarily of software  development
costs, are expensed as incurred.  SFAS No. 86 provides for the capitalization of
certain software  development costs incurred after technological  feasibility of
the  software is  established  or for  development  costs that have  alternative
future uses.  Under the Company's  current  practice of developing new products,
the  technological  feasibility  of the underlying  software is not  established
until  substantially  all  product  development  is  complete,  which  generally
includes the development of a working model. The software development costs that
have been capitalized to date have been insignificant.

(f)  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories at March 31,
1999 and 1998 consisted of:

Raw materials and work in process             $ 2,983         $ 2,392
Finished goods                                 19,393          17,234
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              $22,376         $19,626
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(g)  Advertising Costs
The  Company  generally  expenses  advertising  costs as  incurred,  except  for
production  costs associated with media campaigns which are deferred and charged
to expense at the first run of the ad. Cooperative advertising with distributors
and  retailers is accrued when revenue is  recognized.  Cooperative  advertising
credits are reimbursed  when  qualifying  claims are  submitted.  For the fiscal
years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998 and  1997,  advertising  expenses  totaled
approximately $72,437,000, $55,090,000 and $36,159,000, respectively.

(h)  Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is calculated using the
accelerated and straight-line methods over the following useful lives:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Buildings                             20 to 25 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Computer equipment                    3 to 7 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Furniture and equipment               3 to 7 years
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Leasehold improvements                Lesser of the lease terms or the estimated
                                      useful lives of the improvements
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i)  Intangible Assets
Intangible   assets  net  of  amortization  at  March  31,  1999  and  1998,  of
$90,682,000, and $2,148,000,  respectively, include goodwill, costs of obtaining
product  technology  and  noncompete  covenants  which are  amortized  using the
straight-line  method  over the lesser of their  estimated  useful  lives or the
agreement terms,  typically from two to twelve years.  Amortization  expense for
fiscal years ended March 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was $5,880,000,  $692,000,  and
$654,000,  respectively.  The Company assesses the recoverability of goodwill by
determining  whether the carried  value of the assets may be  recovered  through
estimated future cash flows.

(j)  Income Taxes
Income tax expense is based on reported  earnings before income taxes.  Deferred
income taxes  reflect the impact of  temporary  differences  between  assets and
liabilities  recognized  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  such  amounts
recognized for tax purposes.

(k)  Foreign Currency Translation
For each of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries the functional  currency is its
local currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.  dollars  using  current  exchange  rates,  and  revenues  and expenses are
translated  into U.S.  dollars  using  average  exchange  rates.  The effects of
foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  are  deferred  and  included  as  a
component of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income (loss) in  stockholders'
equity.

Foreign  currency  transaction  gains and  losses  are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions  denominated in currencies  other than the
functional currency.  Included in interest and other income in the statements of
income are foreign  currency  transaction  losses of  $1,168,000,  $517,000  and
$1,024,000,  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

(l)   Net Income Per Share
The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method.

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
for the  fiscal  years  ended  March 31,  1999,  1998 and 1997 were  options  to
purchase 645,000, 137,000 and 623,000 shares of common stock,  respectively,  as
the options'  exercise  price was greater  than the average  market price of the
common shares.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999,  the  weighted-average
exercise price of the respective options was $47.33.

(m)  Employee Benefits
The Company has a 401(k) Plan covering  substantially all of its U.S. employees.
The 401(k)  Plan  permits  the Company to make  discretionary  contributions  to
employees'  accounts based on the Company's financial  performance.  The Company
contributed $2,092,000, $902,000 and $925,000 to the Plan in fiscal 1999, fiscal
1998 and fiscal 1997, respectively.

(n)  Stock-based Compensation
The Company  accounts for  stock-based  awards to employees  using the intrinsic
value method in  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25").

(o)  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is  effective  as of the  beginning  of the first  quarter  of the  fiscal  year
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company is determining the effect of SFAS 133
on its financial statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained for Internal  Use". SOP 98-1 requires that certain costs related to the
development or purchase of  internal-use  software be capitalized  and amortized
over the  estimated  useful  life of the  software.  SOP 98-1 is  effective  for
financial  statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1998.
The  adoption  of SOP 98-1 is not  expected  to have a  material  impact  on the
Company's results of operations.

In December  1998,  the Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee of the AICPA
issued  SOP  98-9,  "Software  Revenue  Recognition,  with  Respect  to  Certain
Arrangements," which required recognition of revenue using the "residual method"
in a multiple element arrangement when fair value does not exist for one or more
of the  undelivered  elements  in the  arrangement.  SOP 98-9 is  effective  for
transactions entered into after March 15, 1999. Under the "residual method", the
total  fair value of the  undelivered  elements  is  deferred  and  subsequently
recognized  in  accordance  with SOP 97-2.  The  Company  will adopt SOP 98-9 in
fiscal  year 2000 and does not expect a material  change to its  accounting  for
revenues as a result of the provisions of SOP 98-9.

(p)  Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Such
estimates  include   provisions  for  doubtful   accounts,   sales  returns  and
allowances,  warranty provisions,  and estimates regarding the recoverability of
prepaid royalty advances and inventories. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(q)  Reclassifications
Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 1999 presentation.

(r) Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
impairment  whenever  events  or  changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of assets is
measured by a comparison  of the carrying  amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Long-term and short-term  held-to-maturity  investments include commercial notes
with original  maturities of five to eight years secured by U.S.  Treasury Notes
which enable the Company to take  advantage of certain tax  incentives  from its
Puerto Rico operation.  These  investments are treated as  held-to-maturity  for
financial reporting purposes.

The fair value of held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 1999 was $24,353,000
which  included  gross  unrealized   gains  of  $153,000.   The  fair  value  of
held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 1998 was  $41,326,000  which  included
gross unrealized gains of $27,000 and gross unrealized losses of $7,000.

(b)  Marketable Securities

Marketable  securities  are  comprised  of equity  securities.  The  Company has
accounted for investments in equity securities as  "available-for-sale"  and has
stated applicable  investments at fair value,  with net unrealized  appreciation
reported as a separate  component  of  accumulated  other  comprehensive  income
(loss) in stockholders'  equity.  Marketable securities had an aggregate cost of
$585,000 and $1,143,000 at March 31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  At March 31,
1999,  marketable  securities included gross unrealized gains of $4,299,000.  At
March  31,  1998  marketable  securities  included  gross  unrealized  gains  of
$2,771,000 and gross unrealized losses of $193,000.

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 1999 and 1998, the fair value of marketable
securities sold was $1,818,000 and $7,276,000,  respectively. The gross realized
gains from these sales totaled  $1,454,000  and  $4,098,000  for fiscal 1999 and
1998,  respectively.  The gain on sale of  investments  is based on the specific
identification method.

(c)  Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts

The Company  utilizes  foreign  currency  forward  exchange  contracts  to hedge
foreign  currency market exposures of underlying  assets,  liabilities and other
obligations,  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in
foreign  currencies.  The Company does not use forward  exchange  contracts  for
speculative or trading  purposes.  The Company's  accounting  policies for these
instruments  are  based on the  Company's  designation  of such  instruments  as
hedging  transactions.   The  criteria  the  Company  uses  for  designating  an
instrument as a hedge include the  instrument's  effectiveness in risk reduction
and   one-to-one   matching  of  forward   exchange   contracts  to   underlying
transactions. Gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are designated
and  effective as hedges of firm  commitments  are deferred  and  recognized  in
income in the same period that the underlying  transactions  are settled.  Gains
and losses on currency  forward  contracts  that are designated and effective as
hedges of existing  transactions  are recognized in income in the same period as
losses and gains on the  underlying  transactions  are  recognized and generally
offset. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria would
be recognized in income in the current period. The Company transacts business in
various foreign currencies.  At March 31, 1999, the Company had foreign exchange
contracts,  all with  maturities of less than nine months,  to purchase and sell
approximately  $178,178,000 in foreign currencies,  primarily in British Pounds,
Canadian  Dollars,   German  Deutschmarks,   Japanese  Yen  and  other  European
currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate,  plus the  unamortized  premium or discount.  At March 31,
1999, fair value of these contracts is not significant.  The  counterparties  to
these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks.
The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not
considered to be material.


(3)  COMMITMENTS

Lease Obligations

The Company leases certain of its current facilities and certain equipment under
non-cancelable  operating  lease  agreements.  The  Company is  required  to pay
property  taxes,  insurance  and  normal  maintenance  costs for  certain of its
facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these
expenses on the remainder of the Company's facilities.

                                       37

<PAGE>


In  February  1995,  the  Company  entered  into a master  operating  lease,  as
subsequently amended, for land and a building to be constructed in Redwood City,
California.  The  initial  term of the lease is for a period of three years from
November 30, 1998.  Monthly lease  payments are based upon the London  InterBank
Offered  Rate.  The  Company  has the option to purchase  the  property  for the
unamortized financed balance at any time after the non-cancelable lease term, or
it may  terminate  the  lease  at any  time  after  the  non-cancelable  term by
arranging  a third  party sale or by making a  termination  payment.  Should the
Company elect to terminate the lease,  it will  guarantee a residual value of up
to 85% of the unamortized value of the property.  As part of the agreement,  the
Company must also comply with certain financial covenants.

Total future minimum lease commitments as of March 31, 1999 are:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total rent expense for all operating  leases was  $19,480,000,  $13,842,000  and
$11,430,000,  for the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1999,  1998  and  1997,
respectively.

(4)  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The  Company  extends  credit  to  various  companies  in the  retail  and  mass
merchandising  industry.  Collection  of trade  receivables  may be  affected by
changes in economic or other industry  conditions and may,  accordingly,  impact
the  Company's  overall  credit risk.  Although the Company  generally  does not
require  collateral,  the Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations of its
customers and reserves for potential credit losses are maintained.

Short-term   investments   are  placed   with  high   credit-quality   financial
institutions or in short-duration  high quality  securities.  The Company limits
the  amount of credit  exposure  in any one  institution  or type of  investment
instrument.

(5)  LITIGATION

The  Company  is subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after
review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the
disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon the
consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(6)  PREFERRED STOCK

At March 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had 1,000,000  shares of Preferred Stock
authorized  but  unissued.  The rights,  preferences,  and  restrictions  of the
Preferred  Stock may be  designated  by the Board of Directors  without  further
action by the Company's stockholders.

(7)  TREASURY STOCK

In February 1999,  the Board of Directors  approved a plan to purchase up to two
million shares of the Company's common stock. For the year ended March 31, 1999,
the Company repurchased  222,500 shares for approximately  $9,001,000 under this
program.  Of these,  99,937 shares were reissued under the Company's Stock Plans
as of March 31, 1999.

When treasury shares are reissued, any excess of the average acquisition cost of
the shares over the proceeds from reissuance is charged to retained earnings.

(8)  STOCK PLANS

(a)  Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The  Company  has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  program  whereby  eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation to
purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock
on the date of  commencement of the offering or on the last day of the six-month
purchase  period.  The program  commenced  in  September  1991.  In fiscal 1999,
241,514  shares were  purchased by the Company and  distributed  to employees at
prices  ranging  from  $26.19 to $36.60.  In fiscal  1998,  199,680  shares were
purchased by the Company and  distributed  to  employees at prices  ranging from
$26.14 to $26.19.  In fiscal 1997,  184,596 shares were purchased by the Company
and  distributed to employees at prices ranging from $21.25 to $25.18 per share.
The weighted average fair value of the fiscal 1999,  fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1997
awards was $18.27,  $9.43,  and $10.41,  respectively.  Under the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan 30,928 shares were  distributed  from reissued  treasury  stock in
fiscal 1999. No shares were distributed  from reissued  treasury stock in fiscal
1998 or fiscal 1997. At March 1999, the Company had 237,444 shares of its Common
Stock reserved for future issuance under the Plan.

Prior to the  Maxis  merger in July  1997,  Maxis  employees  were  eligible  to
participate in an employee  stock purchase plan. In fiscal 1998 and 1997,  Maxis
purchased  7,684,  and 18,220 shares,  respectively,  under this plan which were
distributed to participating employees.  Shares were purchased at prices ranging
from $27.70 to $27.99 in fiscal 1998, and $28.56 to $46.08 in fiscal 1997.

(b)  Stock Option Plans
The Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan,  1993 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Stock Option
Plan and Directors'  Plan ("Option  Plans") provide stock options for employees,
officers and

                                       38

<PAGE>


independent  contractors,  and for  directors,  respectively.  Pursuant to these
Option Plans, the Board of Directors may grant non-qualified and incentive stock
options to  employees  and officers and  non-qualified  options to  celebrities,
employees of certain  companies  in which the Company has an equity  investment,
and directors, at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.

Under the  Company's  stock  option  plans,  69,009  shares were  reissued  from
treasury stock in fiscal 1999. No shares were distributed from reissued treasury
stock in fiscal 1998 or fiscal 1997.

The options  generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are generally
exercisable in monthly  increments  over 50 months.  Certain  options assumed in
connection  with the Maxis  merger in fiscal 1998 expire ten years from the date
of  grant,  and  vest  and  become  exercisable  at a rate  of 25% on the  first
anniversary of the date of grant and 25% of the shares each year thereafter.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 123,  "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation" ("SFAS
123").  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for options
granted under the Company's  employee-based stock option plans. Had compensation
expense  been  determined  based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under those plans in accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's
pro forma net income and net  income  per share for fiscal  1999,  1998 and 1997
would have been:

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing model. The following weighted-average  assumptions
are used for grants made in 1999, 1998 and 1997 under the stock plans: risk-free
interest  rates of 4.39% to 5.55% in 1999,  5.31% to 6.42% in 1998; and 5.48% to
6.36% in 1997;  expected volatility of 59% in fiscal 1999 and 58% in both fiscal
1998 and fiscal 1997; expected lives of 2.27 years in fiscal 1999 and 2.25 years
in fiscal  1998 and  fiscal  1997  under the  Option  Plans and one year for the
Employee Stock Purchase Plan. No dividends are assumed in the expected term. The
Company's  calculations  are based on a multiple option  valuation  approach and
forfeitures  are  recognized  when they  occur.  The above  disclosures  include
options  granted  under the former Maxis option plans as if they were  initially
granted by the Company.

Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options  granted  subsequent to March 31,
1995, the impact of non-vested stock options granted prior to this date has been
excluded from the pro forma calculation.  Accordingly, pro forma adjustments are
not  indicative of future period pro forma  adjustments  as the pro forma effect
will not be fully reflected until subsequent years.

(11)  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURE

(a) Westwood Studios

In September 1998, the Company  completed the  acquisition of Westwood  Studios,
Inc.  and  certain  assets  of the  Irvine,  California  - based  Virgin  Studio
(collectively  "Westwood") for  approximately  $122,688,000  in cash,  including
transaction expenses.  The adjusted allocation of the excess purchase price over
the net  tangible  liabilities  assumed  was  $128,573,000  of  which,  based on
management's  estimates  prepared in  conjunction  with a third party  valuation
consultant,  $41,836,000  was  allocated  to purchased  in-process  research and
development and $86,737,000 was allocated to other  intangible  assets.  Amounts
allocated to other  intangibles  include  franchise  trade names of $32,357,000,
existing  technology of $6,510,000,  workforces of $1,680,000 and other goodwill
of  $46,190,000  and are being  amortized  over lives ranging from two to twelve
years.  Purchased  in-process  research  and  development  includes the value of
products  in the  development  stage  that are not  considered  to have  reached
technological  feasibility or to have alternative future use. Accordingly,  this
non-recurring  item was  expensed in the  Consolidated  Statement of Income upon
consummation  of  the  acquisition.  The  non-recurring  charge  for  in-process
research and  development  reduced diluted  earnings per share by  approximately
$0.59 in the fiscal year 1999. The results of the operations of Westwood and the
estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities  assumed are included in
the Company's financial statements from the date of acquisition.

In conjunction  with the merger of Westwood,  the Company accrued  approximately
$1,500,000  related to direct  transaction costs and other related accruals.  At
March 31,  1999,  there were  $725,000  in accruals  remaining  related to these
items.

In  connection  with the  Westwood  acquisition,  the  purchase  price  has been
allocated to the assets and  liabilities  assumed  based upon the fair values on
the date of acquisition, as follows (in thousands):

================================================================================
Current assets                                                         $  4,500
Property and equipment                                                    3,257
In-process technology                                                    41,836
Other intangible assets                                                  86,737
Current liabilities                                                     (13,642)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total purchase price                                                   $122,688

In management's  opinion, the unaudited pro forma combined results of operations
are not  indicative  of the actual  results  that would  have  occurred  had the
acquisition been consummated at the beginning of fiscal 1998 or at the beginning
of fiscal  1999 or of future  operations  of the  combined  companies  under the
ownership and management of the Company.

(b) ABC Software

In July 1998,  the  Company  acquired  ABC  Software  AG and ABC  Software  GmbH
(collectively "ABC"), independent distributors of entertainment, edutainment and
application software in Switzerland and Austria, respectively, for approximately
$9,466,000  in cash (net of cash acquired of  $5,099,000)  and $570,000 in other
consideration. The transaction has been accounted for under the purchase method.
The  excess  purchase  price  over the fair  value  of the net  tangible  assets
acquired of  approximately  $7,377,000  was  allocated  to goodwill and is being
amortized over 7 years.

(c) Square Co., Ltd.

In May 1998, the Company and Square Co., Ltd.  ("Square"),  a leading  developer
and publisher of entertainment software in Japan, completed the formation of two
new joint ventures in North America and Japan.  In North America,  the companies
formed Square Electronic Arts, LLC ("Square EA"), which has exclusive publishing
rights in North America for future interactive  entertainment  titles created by
Square. Additionally, the Company has the exclusive right to distribute in North
America  products  published  by this joint  venture.  The  Company  contributed
$3,000,000  and owns a 30% minority  interest in this joint venture while Square
owns 70%. This joint venture is accounted for under the equity method.

In Japan, the companies established  Electronic Arts Square KK ("EA Square KK"),
which will  localize and publish in Japan the  Company's  properties  originally
created in North  America  and Europe,  as well as develop and publish  original
video  games in  Japan.  The  Company  contributed  cash and has a 70%  majority
ownership interest, while Square contributed cash and owns 30%. Accordingly, the
assets,  liabilities  and results of operations for EA Square KK are included in
the Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets and Results of Operations since June
1, 1998,  the date of formation.  Square's 30% interest in EA Square KK has been
reflected as "Minority  interest in consolidated joint venture" on the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

(d) Maxis, Inc.
On July 25, 1997, the Company competed a merger with Maxis,  Inc.  ("Maxis"),  a
California-based   interactive   software  developer.   Under  the  transaction,
approximately  4.1 million  shares of Electronic  Arts' stock were exchanged for
all  outstanding  Maxis common  stock.  The  transaction  was accounted for as a
pooling of interests. The accompanying financial statements,  notes and analyses
have been restated for all periods presented to reflect this transaction.

In  conjunction  with  the  merger  of  Maxis,  the  Company  recorded  costs of
$10,792,000.  This  charge  included  direct  transaction  fees  for  investment
bankers,  attorneys,  accountants,  and  other  related  costs of  approximately
$2,781,000  and costs  associated  with  integrating  the  operations of the two
companies of approximately  $8,011,000.  Included in the integration  costs were
redundant facility costs,  severance payments,  equipment  abandonment costs and
other  asset  write  downs,  contract  termination  charges  and  other  related
expenses.  Of the total merger costs,  approximately  $5,185,000 related to cash
expenditures while approximately $5,607,000 related to noncash charges. At March
31,  1999,  there were no accruals  remaining  related to these  merger  related
costs.

Total net  revenue and net income  (loss) for the  individual  entities  for the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1997 is as follows (in thousands):

================================================================================

  Net income (loss)                             53,002     (1,675)        51,327
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (e)  Creative Wonders, LLC
In December 1997, the Company  completed the sale of its 50% ownership  interest
in Creative  Wonders,  LLC, a joint venture  company formed with the Walt Disney
Company for  $16,750,000 in cash. The Company  recognized a gain of $12,625,000,
which is included in interest and other income.  Prior to the sale,  the Company
distributed  children's  interactive  titles  published  and  sold by the  joint
venture into the retail  channel.  The  investment  was  accounted for under the
equity method prior to sale.

 (f) Other Business Combinations

Additionally,  during the quarter ended June 30, 1998, the Company  acquired two
software  development  companies.  In connection  with these  acquisitions,  the
Company incurred a charge of $2,279,000 for acquired in-process technology.  The
charge was made after the Company  concluded that the in-process  technology had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after
taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software.

(12) INCOME TAXES

   The Company's  pretax income from operations for the fiscal years ended March
31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 consisted of the following components:

The  Company  provides  for  U.S.  taxes  on an  insignificant  portion  of  the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and does not provide taxes on
the remainder.  At March 31, 1999,  the  undistributed  foreign  earnings of the
foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately  $122,000,000.  If these earnings
were  distributed to the parent  company,  foreign tax credits  available  under
current law would substantially eliminate the resulting Federal tax liability.

The Company's U.S.  income tax returns for the years 1992 through 1995 have been
examined by the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS). In 1998, the Company received a
notice of  deficiencies  from the IRS. These  deficiencies  relate  primarily to
operations in Puerto Rico,  which the Company is  contesting  in Tax Court.  The
Company  believes that any additional  liabilities,  if any, that arise from the
outcome of this examination  will not be material to the Company's  consolidated
financial statements.

(14) Comprehensive Income

In fiscal  1999,  the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income," which establishes  standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income and its components  (revenues,  expenses,  gains and losses) in financial
statements.  SFAS 130 requires classification of other comprehensive income in a
financial  statement and display of other  comprehensive  income separately from
retained earnings and additional  paid-in capital.  Other  comprehensive  income
includes primarily foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized gains
(losses) on investments.

The change in the components of accumulated other  comprehensive  income, net of
taxes, is summarized as follows (in thousands):

Change in unrealized  gains (losses) on investments,  net are shown net of taxes
of  $727,000,  $(426,000)  and  $(7,202,000)  in  fiscal  1999,  1998 and  1997,
respectively.

The currency  translation  adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they
relate to indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.


(15) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash, cash equivalents,  short-term investments,  receivables,  accounts payable
and accrued liabilities - the carrying amount approximates fair value because of
the short maturity of these instruments.

Long-term investments, investments classified as held-to-maturity and marketable
securities - fair value is based on quoted market prices.

(16) SEGMENT INFORMATION
<TABLE>
In 1999,  the Company  adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures  about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related  Information",  which supersedes SFAS No. 14,  "Financial
Reporting  for  Segments  of a Business  Enterprise".  SFAS No. 131  establishes
standards for the reporting by public business  enterprises of information about
product lines, geographic areas and major customers.  The method for determining
what  information  to report is based on the way that  management  organizes the
operating  segments  within the Company  for making  operational  decisions  and
assessments of financial  performance.  The Company's chief  operating  decision
maker is considered to be the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The CEO
reviews financial  information  presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by
disaggregated  information  about  revenues by geographic  region and by product
lines for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions  and  assessing  financial
performance.  The Company has four reportable segments:  North America,  Europe,
Asia Pacific and Japan, which are organized, managed and analyzed geographically
and operate in one industry segment: the creation, marketing and distribution of
entertainment software.  Information about the Company's operations in the North
America and foreign  areas for the fiscal years ended March 31,  1999,  1998 and
1997 is presented below:

                      ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                  DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT'S FISCAL YEAR 2000
                              EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN

Target annual bonuses are set for each executive based upon a percentage of base
salary.  Bonuses are generally  paid in two parts,  one of which relates only to
the Company's  earnings  results,  and the second part is  discretionary  and is
measured against each individual executive's contributions.  Some executives may
have a third part  which  relates to a  specific  business  unit's or  product's
financial performance achievement.  Bonuses are paid after the end of the fiscal
year.  If profits in any period are less than 85% of plan, no bonus based on the
Company's  performance is paid for that period.  If profits exceed plan during a

Dear Rusty:

This will confirm our  discussion on Tuesday,  September 15. EA will provide you

on improvements made to your current residence, and the temporary loss of income
you will experience in conjunction with Patti's resignation from Pepsi.

months if you are terminated without cause prior to March 31, 2000.

EA agrees to provide a relocation program similar to the Frito-Lay plan with the
exception  that we will  not be  responsible  for any  loan  points  nor will we
provide one month's salary in conjunction with your move to Northern California.

I am thrilled that you have decided to join Electronic  Arts, and very much look
forward to working  with you.  Would you please  acknowledge  acceptance  of the
offer by  signing  in the space  below and  returning  to my  attention  at your
earliest convenience. Thank you.

                                      LEASE

         THIS LEASE,  (hereinafter  referred to as "Lease"),  is made as of this
1st day of April, 1999, by and between LOUISVILLE COMMERCE REALTY CORPORATION, a
Delaware  corporation,  or assigns  (hereinafter  referred to as "Landlord") and
ELECTRONIC  ARTS,  INC.,  a Delaware  corporation  (hereinafter  referred  to as
"Tenant").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS,  Landlord  and Tenant  desire to create a leasehold  estate in
favor of Tenant in the Premises (as hereinafter defined).

         NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the premises, and of the covenants
and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1.  PREMISES.  Effective as of the  Commencement  Date,  Landlord shall
lease unto Tenant and Tenant  shall lease from  Landlord  approximately  250,000
rentable square feet as outlined in Exhibit A ("Premises"),  on the east side of
a building of approximately 400,000 square feet ("Building"),  which Building is
located  on a  parcel  of land  ("Property")  as shown  on  Exhibit  A, and that
machinery and equipment installed in and upon the Premises by Landlord, together
with  all  additions  and  accessions   thereto,   substitutions   therefor  and
replacements  thereof permitted by this Lease  (collectively,  the "Equipment").
The exact square  footage of the Premises  shall be determined by the Landlord's
architect.

          Landlord shall be responsible for  constructing,  at its expense,  the
"Building Shell" as described in Exhibit B hereto, and Tenant shall, at Tenant's
sole  expense  (subject to Paragraph  8(b) below),  and upon the terms set forth
herein, make improvements to the Premises (the "Tenant Improvements")  specified
by Tenant as generally  depicted in a preliminary  space plan (the  "Preliminary
Space Plan") to be submitted to Landlord.

         2.  COMMENCEMENT  DATE AND LEASE TERM.  The initial  term of this Lease
shall be for a period  of five (5)  years  (hereafter  referred  to as  "Term"),
commencing  on the  "Commencement  Date."  The  Commencement  Date  shall be the
earlier of (i) June 15, 1999, or (ii) the date Tenant  commences  beneficial use
of the Premises, determined as set forth hereinbelow. Any use of the Premises by
Tenant  prior  to the  Commencement  Date  shall be  subject  to the  terms  and
conditions of this Lease (except the payment of Rent). Tenant shall be deemed to
have  commenced  beneficial  use of the  Premises  when  Tenant  begins  to move
furniture,  furnishings,  or inventory into the Premises or any portion thereof.
In  no  event  shall  Landlord  be  liable  for  Tenant's  failure  to  complete
construction  by June 15,  1999.  Tenant  shall use  reasonable  efforts to keep
Landlord informed of the progress of construction. The initial twelve (12) month
period after the Commencement  Date and each successive twelve (12) month period
thereafter  during the initial Term and any renewal periods shall be hereinafter
referred to as a "Lease Year." If the Commencement  Date is not the first day of
a month,  then the Term  shall be the period  set forth  above plus the  partial
month in which the Commencement Date occurs.

         3. RENT. As rent for the Premises (all of which is hereinafter referred
to collectively as "Rent"), Tenant shall pay to Landlord all of the following:

                  (a) Base Rent.  Tenant shall pay,  without  offset,  demand or
counterclaim,  as base rent (hereafter  referred to as the "Base Rent") for each
Lease Year the sums  identified on the attached  Exhibit C, Rent  Schedule.  The
monthly  installments  shall be  payable in advance on the first day of each and
every  month  during the said term at the  office of  Landlord  c/o J.P.  Morgan
Investment Management, Inc., 522 Fifth Avenue at 44th Street, New York, New York
10036,  or at such other place as Landlord may  hereafter  designate in writing.
Rent checks are to be made payable to Landlord,  or such other  person,  firm or
corporation  as Landlord may  hereafter  designate  in writing,  except that the
first such installment, in the amount of Twenty-Seven Thousand Dollars ($27,000)
shall be due contemporaneously with the execution of this Lease.

                  (b) Intentionally Omitted.

                  (c) Intentionally Omitted.

                  (d) Intentionally Omitted.

                  (e) Tax on  Lease.  Tenant's  pro  rata  share  (based  on the
Premises) of any federal,  state or local tax  (including  gross  receipts  tax)
assessment,  levy or other  charge  (other than any income tax or real  property
tax)  (hereinafter  collectively  referred  to as  "Tax")  if now  or  hereafter
directly or indirectly upon (a) Landlord with respect to this Lease or the value
thereof, (b) Tenant's use or occupancy of the Premises,  or (c) the Base Rent or
any other sum payable  under this Lease,  shall be paid by Tenant as  Additional
Rent.


<PAGE>
                           Landlord shall  annually  notify Tenant of the amount
which Landlord estimates will be the Tax for each tax year, and Tenant shall pay
such amount in equal monthly  installments in advance on or before the first day
of each of the twelve (12) months after the date of such notice.  Landlord shall
annually  submit to Tenant a statement  showing  Tenant's  pro rata share of the
actual Tax for the  current tax year,  the amount  thereof  theretofore  paid by
Tenant,  and the amount of the  resulting  balance  due  thereon or  overpayment
thereof.  Such  balance due shall be paid by Tenant,  without  interest,  within
thirty (30) days after the date of such  statement.  Official tax bills rendered
by the taxing  authority  shall be presumptive  evidence of the actual amount of
Tax. Tenant shall have the right to audit Landlord's  records pertaining to such
Tax in accordance with Paragraph 11 below.

                  (f) Acceptance.  Tenant does hereby take and hold the Premises
at the Rent hereinabove specifically reserved and payable as aforesaid, and upon
and subject to the terms and conditions herein contained.

                  (g) Late Payment.  If Tenant fails to pay any  installment  of
Rent  on or  before  the  fifth  (5th)  day  of the  calendar  month  when  such
installment becomes due and payable,  Tenant shall pay to Landlord a late charge
of five per cent (5%) of the amount of such installment,  and, in addition,  any
unpaid  installment  shall bear interest at that rate per annum which is two per
cent (2%) greater than the "prime rate" then in effect at Morgan  Guaranty Trust
Company of New York, New York, New York, from the date such  installment  became
due and  payable  to the date of  payment by  Tenant;  provided,  however,  that
nothing herein  contained  shall be construed or implemented in such a manner as
to allow  Landlord to charge or receive  interest in excess of the maximum legal
rate than  allowed  by law.  Such late  charge  and  interest  shall  constitute
Additional  Rent  hereunder  and shall be due and payable  with the next monthly
installment  of  Rent.  Nothing  in this  paragraph  shall  be  deemed  to be in
derogation of Landlord's rights under Paragraph 17.

                  (h) Additional  Rent.  With respect to this Lease,  Additional
Rent shall mean any and all monetary obligations for which Tenant is responsible
under the terms,  covenants  and  conditions  of this Lease,  including  but not
limited to, Base Rent, Tax, late fees, interest payments and Operating Costs.

                  (i) Tenant's  Proportionate  Share.  Landlord and Tenant agree
that Tenant's  "pro rata share" for purposes of Paragraphs  3(e) and 11 shall be
sixty-two and one-half  percent  (62.5%),  the approximate and agreed upon ratio
that the area of the Premises bears to the total rentable area of the Building.

         4. OPTION TO EXTEND TERM.

                  (a) Renewal  Period.  Provided that (i) Tenant is in occupancy
of the Premises and conducting  operations  therein;  (ii) this Lease is in full
force  and  effect,  (iii) no  material  adverse  change in  Tenant's  financial
condition  has occurred,  and (iv) Tenant shall not have been in default  during
the term of the  Lease,  and (v)  shall  not then be in  default  and  shall not
default in the  performance  of any of its  obligations  under this Lease at any
time between the date of issuance of the notice  contemplated  by Paragraph 4(b)
below and the  expiration of the then current lease term,  Tenant shall have the
option to renew this Lease for one (1)  additional  two (2) year term,  with the
annual base rent in such  renewal  period,  being  equal to One Million  Dollars
($1,000,000)  payable in equal monthly  installments  of  Eighty-Three  Thousand
Three Hundred Thirty-Three Dollars and Thirty-Three Cents ($83,333.33) each.

                  (b) Notice Required. Tenant shall give Landlord written notice
of its  intent to  exercise  its  option to extend  the Lease  Term at least One
Hundred  Eighty  (180) days,  but no more than Three  Hundred  Sixty (360) days,
prior to the end of the initial term,  time being of the essence.  Should Tenant
fail to notify Landlord of its intent to exercise such renewal option within the
aforementioned  notice period, time being of the essence,  then Tenant's renewal
option shall expire  without  action by either party and Landlord shall not need
to advise  Tenant in writing of  Tenant's  neglect  in  reference  to the notice
period.

         5. USE OF PREMISES.

                  (a) Tenant may occupy and use the Premises for general  office
and  warehousing  purposes  and for no other  purpose  without  the  consent  of
Landlord,  subject,  however,  to the terms  and  provisions  of any  covenants,
easements,  conditions  or  restrictions  which affect the use of the  Premises.
Tenant  shall  not  permit  any  unlawful  occupation,  business  or trade to be
conducted  on any of the  Premises  or any use to be made  thereof  contrary  to
applicable laws or regulations.  Tenant shall not use or occupy or permit any of
the Premises to be used or occupied,  nor do or permit anything to be done in or
on any of the Premises,  in a manner which would (i) violate any  certificate of
occupancy  affecting  any of the  Premises,  (ii)  make  void  or  voidable  any
insurance  then in force  with  respect  to any of the  Premises,  (iii) make it
difficult  or  impossible  to obtain fire or other  insurance  which is required
hereunder,  or cause the cost of maintaining  such insurance to increase [unless
Tenant  pays  such  increase  in  full],  (iv)  cause  structural  damage to the
Building,  or (v) constitute a public or private  nuisance or waste. In no event
shall Tenant conduct any retail sales in the Premises.

                                        2
<PAGE>


                  (b) As part of its  obligation  to comply  with laws and other
requirements  under Paragraph 5(a) of this Lease,  Tenant shall not (either with
or without  negligence)  generate,  use,  store,  or cause or permit the escape,
disposal or release of any  Hazardous  Materials in or about the Building or the
Property or the Premises. Hazardous Materials shall mean (a) "hazardous wastes",
as defined by the Resource  Conservation  and  Recovery Act of 1976,  as amended
from time to time,  (b)"hazardous  substances",  as defined by the Comprehensive
Environmental Response,  Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended from
time to time, (c)"toxic substances",  as defined by the Toxic Substances Control
Act, as amended from time to time, (d) "hazardous materials",  as defined by the
Hazardous  Materials  Transportation  Act, as amended from time to time, (e) any
applicable state or local laws and the regulations  adopted under these acts, as
amended from time to time, (f) oil or other petroleum  products  whether refined
or unrefined,  (g) any highly combustible  substance and (h) any substance whose
presence in Landlord's  reasonable judgment could be detrimental to the Building
or the Property or the Premises or  hazardous to health or the  environment.  If
any lender or  governmental  agency  shall  ever  require  testing to  ascertain
whether  or not there has been any  release  of  Hazardous  Materials,  then the
reasonable  costs  thereof shall be reimbursed by Tenant to Landlord upon demand
as additional  charges if such  requirement  applies to the  Premises;  provided
however,  the  foregoing  shall not  include any Phase I  environmental  reports
customarily  required by lenders  and shall be  applicable  only if Tenant,  its
agents, employees,  contractors,  subtenants or licensees is suspected of having
directly or indirectly  caused a release of Hazardous  Materials in or about the
Premises  which gives rise to the  testing.  In addition,  Tenant shall  execute
affidavits, representations and the like from time to time at Landlord's request
concerning  Tenant's  best  knowledge  and  belief  regarding  the  presence  of
Hazardous Materials in the Premises.  In all events,  Tenant shall indemnify and
hold Landlord  harmless of and from any and all costs and expenses of any nature
arising from the release of Hazardous  Materials in the Premises occurring while
Tenant is in  possession,  or elsewhere  on the  Property and any adjacent  real
estate owned by Landlord,  if caused by Tenant or persons  acting under  Tenant.
The within covenants shall survive the expiration or earlier  termination of the
Lease.

                  (c) If  Tenant  fails to  comply  with any  applicable  law or
regulation  or if  Landlord  reasonably  believes  the  violation  of any law or
regulation is threatened, Landlord shall have the right (but not the obligation)
following  thirty  (30) days notice to Tenant  unless  Tenant  commences  to act
during or prior to such period,  and diligently pursues the cure of such failure
to comply (unless such failure or threatened  failure causes  imminent threat to
life or property in which case no notice is required), to act in place of Tenant
and to take  such  action  as it may  deem  necessary  or  desirable  to  ensure
compliance  or to  mitigate,  abate  or  correct  the  violation  or  threatened
violation.  All costs of any kind whatsoever  incurred by Landlord in connection
therewith,  including  consultants'  and reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  shall be
payable on demand, shall bear interest at the default rate until paid, and shall
constitute additional rent.

                  (d) Tenant shall indemnify,  defend and hold Landlord harmless
from and against  any and all claims,  losses,  damages,  liabilities,  cost and
expenses,  including  attorneys'  fees,  arising from Tenant's failure to comply
with all applicable laws and regulations. The foregoing provisions shall survive
the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

         6. [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]

         7. CONSTRUCTION OF PREMISES.

                  Tenant  warrants that the Premises shall be improved in a good
and workmanlike  manner in conformance  with all applicable  federal,  state and
local codes and regulations in effect at that time, including but not limited to
the Americans With Disabilities Act, as amended.

         8. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS.

                  (a) Tenant shall construct,  at Tenant's sole cost (subject to
the Tenant Work Allowance as provided in Paragraph 8(b) below),  improvements to
the Premises (the "Tenant  Improvements")  substantially  in accordance with the
Space Plan approved by Landlord prior to  commencement of  construction.  Tenant
shall,  in  consultation  with  Landlord,  coordinate  the  design of the Tenant
Improvements,  and the budgeting of the costs thereof.  Tenant shall arrange for
the preparation of  "Construction  Drawings and  Specifications,"  consisting of
construction  working drawings,  the mechanical,  electrical and other technical
specifications,  and the finishing  details,  including wall finishes and colors
and  technical  and  mechanical  equipment  installation,  if any,  all of which
details  the  installation  of the  Tenant  Improvements  in the  Premises.  The
architects   and   engineers   who  prepare  such   Construction   Drawings  and
Specifications  shall be selected by Tenant subject to Landlord's approval which
shall not be unreasonably withheld. Within ten (10) business days of its receipt
of any  of  (i)  proposed  Construction  Drawings  and  Specifications  and  any
amendments  thereto,  (ii) the  estimated  budget  for the  Tenant  Work and any
amendments  thereto,  (iii) proposed  change  orders,  Landlord shall provide to
Tenant  notice of any  refusal  to approve  any  aspect of any such item,  which
notice  shall  state  with  particularity  those  elements  thereof  as to which
Landlord does not approve,  and the detailed reasons  therefor.  Should Landlord
fail to  provide  such  notice to Tenant  within  such  period,  such item shall
conclusively be deemed to have been approved.  Following approval by Landlord of
Construction  Drawings and  Specifications,  and the estimated  budget therefor,
which  approval  shall be reflected by  Landlord's  initialing  as approved such
Construction Drawings and Specifications,  and the budget therefor,  Tenant will
solicit bids from one or more general  contractors  for the  construction of the
Tenant Improvements, and Tenant shall, following

                                       3

<PAGE>


consultation  with  Landlord,  contract  for  the  construction  of  the  Tenant
Improvements  with a contractor  reasonably  acceptable to Landlord,  and Tenant
shall  thereafter  coordinate and supervise such  construction  and consult with
Landlord regarding such construction.

                  (b) Tenant shall  receive an amount equal to the lesser of the
actual cost of Tenant Work or Six Hundred  Eighty-Seven  Thousand  Five  Hundred
Dollars ($687,500) (the "Tenant Work Allowance") to be applied against the costs
associated  with the design and  construction of the Tenant  Improvements  (such
design and  construction  being  referred to herein as the "Tenant  Work").  The
costs of the Tenant Work shall  include  all costs to be expended in  connection
with the design and construction of the Tenant  Improvements,  including but not
limited to the (i)  architectural  and engineering fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Tenant Work, including the preparation of the Space Plan and
the Construction  Drawings and  Specifications;  (ii)  governmental  agency plan
check,  building and other permits and other fees (including any code compliance
changes  required by any governmental  entity or authority  having  jurisdiction

the construction of the Tenant Work; (v) testing and inspecting  costs; (vi) the
actual  costs and  charges  for  material  and  labor,  contractor's  profit and
contractor's   general  overhead  incurred  in  constructing  the  Tenant  Work,
including  the cost of any change  orders;  (vii) the cost of  constructing  the
demising  walls;  and (viii)  utility  hook-up  and  tap-in  fees.  The  parties
anticipate  that the  cost of the  Tenant  Work  will  exceed  the  Tenant  Work
Allowance. Landlord shall pay to Tenant the Tenant Work Allowance on the last of
the following to occur:  (a) completion of the Tenant  Improvements,  or (b) ten
(10) days after  Landlord's  receipt of Tenant's  payment of rent for the second
month of the Term; and (c) thirty (30) days following  Tenant's  presentation of
all final and  unconditional  lien  waivers,  a  certificate  of  occupancy  and
Tenant's  written  acceptance of the Tenant  Improvements  in form and substance
satisfactory to Landlord.

                  (c) Tenant designates Pam Samson, whose address is 209 Redwood
Shores,  Redwood CA  94065-1175  or such other person as Tenant may designate in
writing  to  Landlord  ("Tenant's  Authorized  Representative")  as  the  person
authorized   to  (i)  initial  as  approved   all   Construction   Drawings  and
Specifications, budgets, change orders, and approvals pursuant to this Paragraph
8 and (ii)  communicate  with Landlord  regarding the  decisions,  elections and
requests of Tenant.  Landlord  shall not be  obligated to respond to or act upon
any such  item  until  such  item  has been  initialed  by  Tenant's  Authorized
Representative.

         9. LANDLORD'S LIABILITY.

                  (a)  Landlord's  Indemnity.  Subject to the provisions of this
Paragraph 9,  Landlord  agrees to protect,  indemnify,  hold harmless and defend
Tenant and its  respective  members,  directors,  officers,  agents,  employees,
successors  and assigns,  where herein  permitted,  from and against any and all
loss, cost, damage,  liability or expense as incurred (including but not limited
to actual  attorneys'  fees and legal  costs)  arising  out of or related to any
claim,  suit or  judgment  brought by or in favor of any  person or persons  for
damage,  loss or expense due to, but not limited to,  bodily  injury,  including
death, or property  damage  sustained by such person or persons which arises out
of, is  occasioned by or is in any way  attributable  to the use or occupancy of
any common  areas of the  Building,  except  that  caused by the  negligence  or
willful  misconduct of Tenant,  its successors or assigns,  and their respective
agents, employees and invitees.

                  (b) Limitation of Liability.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  contained in this Lease, it is expressly  understood and agreed by and
between the parties hereto that: (i) the recourse of Tenant or its successors or
assigns against Landlord with respect to the alleged breach by or on the part of
Landlord of any  representation,  warranty,  covenant,  undertaking or agreement
contained in the Lease or otherwise  arising out of Tenant's use of the Premises
or the Property  (collectively,  "Landlord's Lease  Undertakings")  shall extend
only to  Landlord's  interest in the real estate of which the  Premises  demised
under the  Lease  are a part  ("Landlord's  Real  Estate")  and not to any other
assets of Landlord or its  owners;  and (ii) except to the extent of  Landlord's
interest  in  Landlord's  Real  Estate,   no  personal   liability  or  personal
responsibility of any sort with respect to any of Landlord's Lease  Undertakings
or any alleged breach thereof is assumed by, or shall at any time be asserted or
enforceable  against,   Landlord,   J.P.  Morgan  Investment   Management  Inc.,
Landlord's  property  manager,  or against  any of their  respective  directors,
officers,  employees,  agents,  constituent  parties,  beneficiaries,  trustees,
shareholders or representatives.

                  (c)  Transfer  of  Landlord's  Interest.  In the  event of any
transfer of Landlord's interest in the Property, Landlord shall be automatically
freed and  relieved  from all  applicable  liability  accruing  thereafter  with
respect to  performance  of any covenant or  obligation  on the part of Landlord
provided any  deposits or advance  rents held by Landlord are turned over to the
grantee and said grantee expressly  assumes,  subject to the limitations of this
Paragraph  9, all of the terms,  covenants  and  conditions  of this Lease to be
performed on the part of Landlord,  it being intended  hereby that the covenants
and obligations  contained in this Lease on the part of Landlord shall,  subject
to all the  provisions  of  this  Paragraph  9,  be  binding  on  Landlord,  its
successors and assigns, only during their respective periods of ownership.

                  (a) Definition.  As used herein,  the term  "Operating  Costs"
means  (except as  specifically  excluded  below) the actual  costs  incurred in
owning,  operating and maintaining the Building and Property during each year of
the Lease Term.  Such operation and maintenance  costs shall include,  by way of
example rather than of limitation,  (i) real property, county, and other similar
taxes or  assessments,  including  but not limited to any  special  assessments,
levied  against any or all of the  Building and  Property;  (ii) charges or fees
for,  and  taxes  on,  the  furnishing  of  water,  sewer  service,  gas,  fuel,
electricity, drainage or other utility services to the Premises and common areas
of the Building and Property;  (iii) costs of providing  trash removal  service,
landscaping service,  snow removal service,  and of maintaining grounds,  common
areas of the Property,  access easements,  parking areas, and mechanical systems
of the Building;  (iv) all other reasonable  costs of maintaining,  repairing or
replacing any or all of the Building or Property,  except (a) costs for repairs,
maintenance and replacements required due to defective materials,  installations
or workmanship at the time of initial  construction of the Building and Property
and expenses  incurred in connection with the enforcement of any warranty rights
in connection therewith,  or (b) costs to repair the roof, foundation,  interior
load bearing partitions, exterior walls and window systems, except to the extent
any such  structural  repair is required due to Tenant's  negligence  or willful
misconduct;  (v) charges or fees for any necessary  governmental  permits;  (vi)
management  fees (not to exceed  three  percent of annual base  rentals from the
Property) under a management agreement, and related overhead and expenses; (vii)
premiums for hazard, liability, workmen's compensation or similar insurance upon
any  or all of the  Building  and  Property  as  maintained  by  Landlord  under
Paragraph 20; (viii) costs arising  under  service  contracts  with  independent
contractors  for  servicing,  maintenance  and repair of Building  equipment and
systems;  (ix) any  assessments  or charges  imposed on Landlord or the Property
pursuant to the Declaration of Covenants,  Conditions and Restrictions  dated as
of April 30,  1998 of record in Deed Book  7033,  Page 714 in the  Office of the
Clerk of Jefferson  County,  Kentucky as amended from time to time provided such
assessments  or charges are not included in any of the other costs  described in
this  subparagraph  (a);  and  (x) the  cost of any  other  items  which,  under
generally accepted accounting principles  consistently applied from year to year
with respect to the Building and Property,  constitute  operating or maintenance
costs  attributable  to any or all of the  Premises.  Landlord  and  its  agents
reserve the right to enter onto the Premises at reasonable times upon reasonable
notice from Landlord or its agent and accompanied by a representative of Tenant,
excepting  emergency,  for the specific  purpose of managing and maintaining the
Premises.  Landlord  agrees that it shall make no profit from its  collection of
Operating Costs.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Operating
Costs shall not  include (i) any costs  (including  payments  of  principal  and
interest under any mortgage and any ground rental payments)  associated with the
initial construction of the Building,  (ii) costs of development of the Property
or the  Premises,  (iii) costs of painting or  decorating  areas of the Building
other  than  common and public  areas,  and  exterior  elements  (iv)  brokerage
commissions,  legal fees,  construction  costs and concessions or inducements to
any tenant in connection with leasing premises in the Building,  and advertising
expenses in connection with the leasing of the Building, (v) legal fees relating
to tenant leases, financings of the Building, and zoning and land-use issues and
violations by Landlord under tenant leases, (vi) salaries and other compensation
paid to officers or executives of Landlord or any partner, principal or owner of
the  entity  comprising  Landlord,  (vii)  fees or  charges  paid  to any  party
affiliated  with Landlord on account of the provision by such entity of goods or
services constituting Operating Costs of the Building to the extent such fees or
charges  exceed  the  fees or  charges  that  would  have  been  incurred  to an
independent  entity  in  an  arm's  length  transaction,   (viii)  any  expenses
reimbursable  by any tenant of the  Building,  insurance  company or  condemning
authority,  or actually reimbursed by any other source, (ix) charges for heating
and air conditioning  service  furnished to other tenants of the Building during
other than normal business hours as determined by Landlord,  (x) advertising and
marketing  costs,  (xi)  Landlord's  income  taxes,  (xii) repairs or other work
occasioned  by fire or other  casualty of an insurable  nature,  but only to the
extent of any recovery actually  received by Landlord,  and (xiii) costs arising
from Landlord's civic activities or charitable or political  contributions,  all
of which costs are the  responsibility  of the  Landlord  except where agreed to
otherwise by the parties in writing.

                  (c) In order to provide for current  payments,  a statement of
Landlord's  estimate of  expenses as  initially  set forth in  Paragraph  11 (a)
above, together with the amount of Tenant's Additional Rent resulting therefrom,
shall be submitted by Landlord to Tenant prior to the beginning of each calendar
year or part thereof  during the Term.  Tenant  shall pay  monthly,  one-twelfth
(1/12th) of Tenant's pro rata share of Landlord's  estimate of Operating  Costs.
Further,  from time to time during any  calendar  year,  Landlord  may submit to
Tenant a revised statement of Landlord's  estimate of Tenant's pro rata share of
any Operating Costs and within thirty (30) days after delivery of such statement
(including any statement  delivered  after the expiration or termination of this
Lease), Tenant shall pay monthly to Landlord, as Additional Rent an amount equal
to  one-twelfth  (1/12th) of the revised  amount so estimated.  After the end of
each  fiscal  year,  Landlord  will,  as soon as  practical,  submit to Tenant a
statement of the actual expenses, incurred for Operating Costs for the preceding
fiscal year.  Such statement  shall also indicate the amount of Tenant's  excess
payment or underpayment based on the Landlord's estimate.

                           If   Additional   Rent  paid  by  Tenant  during  the
preceding  calendar  year  shall be in excess  of, or less than its share of the
actual expenses incurred by Landlord for Operating Costs for that year, Landlord
and Tenant agree to make the appropriate  adjustment following the submission of
Landlord's  statement  by  Tenant  paying  any  Additional  Rent  due  with  the
installment  of rent  due for  the  month  following  submission  of  Landlord's
statement,  or Tenant  deducting its excess payment from the installment of rent
for such month.

                           During  the final  year of the  Lease  Term if Tenant
overpays  its portion of  Operating  Costs,  said over  payment  amount shall be
returned by Landlord within thirty (30) days of termination provided no event of
default has occurred or is occurring.

                           Within   thirty   (30)  days  after  the  receipt  of
Landlord's  statement showing actual figures for the year, Tenant shall have the
right to request  copies of a statement  of  "Operating  Costs of the  Building"
prepared  by the  Landlord  which  shall  be  supplied  to the  Tenant  within a
reasonable time after Tenant's written request, but no such request shall extend
the time for payment as set forth in  Paragraph  11(c).  Unless  Tenant  asserts
specific  error(s)  within  fifteen (15) days after  Landlord has complied  with
Tenant's  request,  the  statement  submitted by Landlord  shall be deemed to be
correct.  Provided Tenant timely asserts such specific errors, and is current in
its  obligations to Landlord for the payment of all sums due to Landlord as Rent
under this Lease, and is not otherwise in default in its obligations  under this
Lease,  Tenant  shall  have the right,  exercisable  no more than once per Lease
Year, to cause  Landlord's books and records showing Tax and Operating Costs for
the prior Lease Year to be examined by a Certified Public Accountant  engaged by
Tenant upon no less than thirty (30) days prior written notice and during normal
business  hours at any time within one hundred and eighty  (180) days  following
the expiration of the prior Lease Year. No such Certified Public  Accountant may
be engaged on a contingent  fee basis.  Such  examination  shall,  at Landlord's
option,  occur at the offices of the Landlord's  management agent, and shall not
take more than thirty (30) days to complete.  Any information obtained by Tenant
from such  examination  will be  treated as  confidential  unless and until such
information has been publicly  disclosed by Landlord;  provided,  however,  that
nothing herein contained shall limit or impair the right or obligation of Tenant
to disclose such  information  when  required to do so by law or to  appropriate
regulatory  authorities having jurisdiction over its affairs, or to use the same
in connection  with the enforcement of the terms and conditions of the Lease. As
a condition of such  examination,  Landlord  may require any party  reviewing or
having  access to  Landlord's  records to  execute  and  deliver  to  Landlord a
confidentiality  agreement  substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
E. In the  event  that  Operating  Costs or Tax for any  Lease  Year  have  been
overstated by seven percent (7%) or more,  Landlord shall promptly  reimburse or
credit Tenant for the reasonable  costs of such audit,  in addition to refunding
all overpayments previously made by Tenant. In the event that Operating Costs or
Tax for any Lease Year have been  overstated  by less than seven  percent  (7%),
Tenant shall bear the costs of the audit but Landlord shall  promptly  refund or
credit all overpayments previously made by Tenant.

                           In addition to the Rent and Additional  Rent provided
elsewhere  herein,  Tenant shall be responsible for making direct payment of all
costs incurred in operating the Premises to the parties providing service to the
Premises,  including without  limitation,  all utility costs,  trash removal and
janitorial  services.  Tenant shall at all times maintain the Premises in a neat
and clean manner, and shall place all trash in its dumpster.

         12. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBLETTING.

                  (a) Tenant shall not  mortgage,  pledge or encumber this Lease
without   Landlord's  prior  written   consent,   which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  (b) Tenant shall have the right to assign this Lease or sublet
all or any portion of the Premises  throughout  the Term,  subject to Landlord's
prior  written  consent and approval,  which  consent shall not be  unreasonably
withheld  or  delayed,  provided,  that  Tenant  remains  fully  liable  for the
performance of all terms and conditions of this Lease  including but not limited
to the  payment  of Base  Rent and  Additional  Rent and  that the  assignee  or
subtenant  agrees to be bound by all terms,  conditions,  and provisions of this
Lease.  If Tenant wants to assign,  sublet or otherwise  transfer all or part of
the  Premises or this Lease,  then Tenant  shall give  Landlord  written  notice
("Tenant's  Request  Notice")  of the  identity  of  the  proposed  assignee  or
subtenant and its business,  all terms of the proposed assignment or subletting,
the  commencement  date of the proposed  assignment or subletting (the "Proposed
Sublease  Commencement  Date"),  the area proposed to be assigned or sublet (the
"Proposed  Sublet Space") and such other  information as Landlord may reasonably
request.  Tenant  shall  also  transmit  therewith  the  most  recent  financial
statement or other  evidence of  financial  responsibility  of such  assignee or
subtenant and a certification  executed by Tenant and such proposed  assignee or
subtenant  stating whether any premium or other  consideration is being paid for
the proposed assignment or sublease. Any sublease,  assignment or other transfer
shall be effective on forms  approved by Landlord and Tenant.  Tenant assigns to
Landlord  any sum due to Tenant from any  assignee,  subtenant  or  occupancy of
Tenant as security for Tenant's  performance of its obligations pursuant to this
Lease,  provided,  however,  that Tenant  shall have the license to collect such
rents  provided  prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of Default.  Following an
Event of Default, Tenant authorizes each such assignee, subtenant or occupant to
pay such sum  directly  to  Landlord  if such  assignee,  subtenant  or occupant
receives  written notice from Landlord  specifying  that such rent shall be paid
directly to Landlord.  Landlord's collection of such rent shall not be construed
as an  acceptance  of such  assignee,  subtenant  or  occupant as a tenant nor a
waiver of any  default  hereunder  by Tenant.  Notwithstanding  anything in this
Paragraph  12 to the  contrary,  provided no Event of Default  exists under this
Lease,  or would exist but for the  pendency of any cure  periods  provided  for
under Paragraph 17, Tenant may, without Landlord's consent,  but after providing
written  notice to  Landlord,  assign this Lease or sublet all or any portion of
the Premises to any Related Entity (as hereinafter defined) provided that (i) in
the event of an assignment,  such Related Entity assumes in full all of Tenant's
obligations  under this Lease;  (ii) Landlord is provided with a counterpart  of
the fully executed agreement of assignment or sublease, which shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Landlord; (iii) to the extent Tenant

                                       6

<PAGE>


remains in existence  Tenant remains liable under the terms of this Lease;  (iv)
such Related  Entity is not a  governmental  entity or agency;  (v) such Related
Entity's use  requirement  does not differ from the  Permitted  Use described in
Paragraph 5 hereof;  and (vi) such  Related  Entity does not require  additional
services  other than those agreed to be provided by Landlord  under the terms of
this  Lease.  "Related  Entity"  shall be  defined  as  (i)any  parent  company,
subsidiary,  or affiliate of Tenant,  which  controls,  is controlled  by, or is
under common control with Tenant, and/or (ii) any entity into which Tenant shall
be merged or consolidated, or which purchases substantially all of the assets of
Tenant and assumes the  liabilities  of Tenant under this Lease and continues in
the same business as that of Tenant.

                  (c) Intentionally Omitted.

                  (d) If Tenant  proposes  to assign  this Lease other than to a
Related Entity, Landlord may, at its option, upon written notice to Tenant given
within ten (10)  business  days after its  receipt of Tenant's  Request  Notice,
together with all other necessary  information,  elect to recapture the Premises
and  terminate  this Lease.  If Tenant  proposes to sublease  all or part of the
Premises for the remainder of the Term, Landlord may, at its option upon written
notice to Tenant  given  within  ten (10)  business  days  after its  receipt of
Tenant's Request Notice, together with all other necessary information, elect to
recapture  such portion of the Premises as Tenant  proposes to sublease and upon
such election by Landlord,  this Lease shall  terminate as to the portion of the
Premises  recaptured.  If a portion  of the  Premises  is  recaptured,  the Rent
payable  under this Lease shall be  proportionately  reduced based on the square
footage of the Rentable Square Feet retained by Tenant and the square footage of
the Rentable  Square Feet leased by Tenant  immediately  prior to such recapture
and termination, and Landlord and Tenant shall thereupon execute an amendment to
this Lease in accordance therewith. Landlord may thereafter, without limitation,
lease the  recaptured  portion  of the  Premises  to the  proposed  assignee  or
subtenant  without  further  liability  to  Tenant.  Upon any such  termination,
Landlord and Tenant shall have no further  obligations  or  liabilities  to each
other under this Lease with respect to the  recaptured  portion of the Premises,
except with respect to obligations  or liabilities  which accrue or have accrued
hereunder as of the date of such  termination (in the same manner as if the date
of such  termination  were the date  originally  fixed for the expiration of the
term hereof).

                  (e) If any sublease,  assignment or other transfer (whether by
operation of law or otherwise)  provides that the  subtenant,  assignee or other
transferee (or any affiliate thereof) is to pay any amount in excess of the rent
and other charges due under this Lease, then, whether such excess be in the form
of an  increased  rental,  lump sum  payment,  payment  for the sale or lease of
fixtures  or  other  leasehold  improvements  or  any  other  form  (and  if the
applicable  space  does not  constitute  the  entire  Premises,  the  amount and
existence of such excess shall be determined on a prorata  basis),  Tenant shall
pay to Landlord  fifty  percent  (50%) of any such excess  within ten (10) days.
Tenant shall in all events  diligently pursue the collection of all amounts owed
by any subtenant, assignee or other transferee. Landlord shall have the right to
inspect  and  audit  Tenant's  books  and  records  relating  to  any  sublease,
assignment or other transfer.

         13.  CASUALTY  DAMAGE.  In the event of damage  or  destruction  of the
Premises by fire or any other casualty, this Lease shall not be terminated,  but
the Premises shall be promptly and fully  repaired or restored,  as the case may
be, by  Landlord  at its own cost and  expense  in an amount  not to exceed  the
amount of insurance proceeds available.  Due allowance,  however, shall be given
for reasonable time required for adjustment and settlement of insurance  claims,
and for such  other  delays as may  result  from  government  restrictions,  and
controls on  construction,  if any, and for strikes,  national  emergencies  and
other conditions beyond the control of Landlord. It is agreed that in any of the
aforesaid events, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect, but if the
condition is such so as to make the entire Premises  untenantable  for practical
use for  Tenant's  purposes,  then the Rent  which  Tenant is  obligated  to pay
hereunder  shall abate as of the date of the occurrence  until the Premises have
been fully and completely  restored by Landlord.  Any unpaid or prepaid Rent for
the month in which said condition occurs shall be prorated.  If the Premises are
partially  damaged or destroyed  but the Tenant can still make  practical use of
the balance of the  Premises;  then during the period that Tenant is deprived of
the use of the damaged portion of said Premises, Tenant shall be required to pay
Rent covering only that part of the Premises that it is able to occupy, based on
that portion of total rent which the amount of square foot area  remaining  that
can be occupied bears to the total square foot area of all the Premises  covered
by this  Lease.  In the event  that  twenty  five  percent  (25%) or more of the
Premises  are  damaged  or  destroyed  by fire  or  other  casualty  so as to be
untenantable  for practical use for Tenant's  purposes and it shall require more
than one  hundred  eighty  (180) days for  Landlord  to  substantially  complete
restoration  of same as  reasonably  concurred  on by Tenant,  then either party
hereto upon  written  notice  delivered  within  thirty (30) days of the fire or
other  casualty to the other party may terminate  this Lease,  in which case the
Rent shall be apportioned  and paid to the date of said fire or other  casualty.
Subject to the foregoing, no compensation,  or claim, or diminution of Rent will
be  allowed  or  paid,  by  Landlord,   by  reason  of  consequential   damages,
inconvenience,  annoyance, or injury to business,  arising from the necessity of
repairing  the Premises or any portion of the Building of which they are a part,
however the necessity may occur.

         14. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS.

                  (a)  Subject  to  Tenant's   responsibilities   set  forth  in
Paragraph 14 (d), Landlord shall keep the Building and all machinery,  equipment
and  fixtures  attached  to, or used in  connection  with the  operation  of the
Building, including all electrical,  heating, mechanical,  sanitary,  sprinkler,
utility, power, plumbing, cleaning, refrigeration, ventilating, air conditioning
and elevator systems and equipment  (excluding,  however,  lines,  improvements,
systems and machinery for water, gas, steam and electricity owned and maintained
by any public utility company or governmental  agency or body and excluding also
any of  Tenant's  property or plate  glass) in good order and  repair.  Landlord
reserves the right of access to the Premises for the purposes of such operation,
cleaning,  maintenance,  safety,  security and repairs, and agrees that it shall
use reasonable  efforts (except in the case of emergency) to provide  reasonable
advance  notice to Tenant of its intent to enter the Premises for such purposes.
The cost for  maintaining  the Building and Premises in good order and repair as
contemplated by this Paragraph 14 (a) shall be an Operating Cost for purposes of
Paragraph  11  hereof.  There  shall be no  abatement  in rents due and  payable
hereunder   and  no  liability  on  the  part  of  Landlord  by  reason  of  any
inconvenience, annoyance or disruption arising from Landlord's making reasonable
repairs,  additions or  improvements  to the Building or Premises in  accordance
with its obligations  hereunder  provided Landlord is diligently  pursuing same.
Tenant will not do or permit anything to be done in the Premises or the Building
of which they form a part or bring or keep  anything  therein which shall in any
way increase the rate of fire or other  insurance for said  Building,  or on the
property  kept  therein,  or  obstruct,  or  interfere  with the rights of other
tenants, or in any way injure or annoy them, or those having business with them,
or conflict with them or conflict with the fire laws or regulations, or with any
insurance  policy upon said Building or any part thereof,  or with any statutes,
rules or  regulations  enacted or established  by the  appropriate  governmental
authority.  If any increase in the rate of fire insurance or other  insurance is
stated by any  insurance  company  or by any  insurance  rate  bureau due to any
activity or equipment of Tenant,  such  statement  shall be conclusive  evidence
that the  increase  in such rate is caused by such  activity or  equipment,  and
Tenant shall be liable for such increase and shall reimburse  Landlord  therefor
upon  demand,  and any such sum  shall be  considered  Additional  Rent  payable
hereunder.

                           In the  event  Landlord  elects  to make  substantial
improvements  or  additions  to  the  Building,   Property  or  Premises,   such
improvements or additions  shall not adversely  affect Tenant's use of or access
to the  Premises  unless  Landlord has  obtained  the prior  written  consent of
Tenant,  which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld,  to  make  such
improvements or additions  which affect Tenant's  Premises in an adverse manner.
Landlord  shall  be free to make  improvements  or  additions  to the  Building,
Property or Premises  which do not have an adverse  effect on Tenant's use of or
access to the Premises.

                  (b) After  substantial  completion  of Building  or  Premises,
except as hereinafter  expressly set forth Tenant will not make any alterations,
installments,  changes,  replacements,  additions or improvements,  collectively
"Alterations",  in or to the  Premises  or any part  thereof,  without the prior
written consent of Landlord,  not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. In the
event Landlord  elects to have the  Alterations  remain upon the Premises,  said
written consent shall include Landlord's  election.  It is expressly  understood
that all  Alterations  shall be performed in a good and  workmanlike  manner and
shall conform to all rules and regulations  established from time to time by any
applicable  underwriter's  association and conform to all requirements of local,
state and federal  governments.  All Alterations  shall be made at Tenant's sole
expense, by contractors,  or subcontractors reasonably approved by Landlord, and
only after (i) Tenant has  obtained  all  necessary  permits  from  governmental
authorities and (ii) Tenant has submitted  complete plans and  specifications to
Landlord with respect to the  Alterations and Landlord has approved them. If any
mechanic's  lien is filed  against  the  Premises  or the  Building  for work or
materials  furnished to Tenant,  the lien shall be  discharged  or bonded off by
Tenant,  solely at  Tenant's  expense,  within  thirty  (30) days  after  Tenant
receives notice thereof.  Tenant shall indemnify and hold harmless Landlord from
any and all expenses (including  attorney's fees), liens and claims or damage to
persons,  property,  or the  Building  which  may arise  from the  making of any
Alterations.  Tenant will deliver to Landlord an architect's  certification that
the Alterations were constructed in accordance with the plans and specifications
previously approved by Landlord.

                           It is also expressly  understood that all Alterations
upon the Premises  (whether with or without  Landlord's  consent),  shall at the
election of Landlord,  as provided in the written consent required herein above,
remain upon the Premises and be surrendered  with the Premises at the expiration
of this Lease without  disturbance,  molestation or injury.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, provided (i) this Lease is in full force and effect, (ii) no material
adverse  change in Tenant's  financial  condition has  occurred,  and (iii) that
Tenant  shall not have been in default  more than twice  during the term of this
Lease and shall not then be in  default  in the  performance  of any  obligation
under this Lease, Tenant shall have the right to remove, prior to the expiration
or  termination  of this Lease,  all movable  furniture,  fixtures or  equipment
installed in the Premises solely at Tenant's expense. Should Landlord elect that
alterations,  installments, changes, replacements,  additions to or improvements
made by Tenant are not to remain on the  Premises,  Tenant  hereby  agrees  that
within  five (5)  days  following  the  expiration  of the  Term of this  Lease,
Landlord  shall have the right to cause same to be removed at Tenant's sole cost
and expense.  Tenant hereby agrees to reimburse Landlord for the reasonable cost
of such removal together with the cost of restoring the Premises to its original
condition.

                  (c) Tenant  shall not install any other  equipment of any kind
or nature whatsoever which will or may necessitate any changes,  replacements or
additions to or require the use of the water system, air conditioning  system or
the electrical  system of the Premises  without the prior written consent of the
Landlord,  which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or

                                       8

<PAGE>


delayed.  In the event that Tenant  wishes to install  machinery  or  mechanical
equipment  which may cause noise or vibration to be transmitted to the structure
of the Building or any space  therein,  such  machinery  shall be installed  and
maintained by Tenant,  at Tenant's  expense,  on vibration  eliminators or other
devices  sufficient to eliminate  such noise and  vibration.  Tenant may, at its
expense, install and remove additional equipment and machinery used or useful in
Tenant's  business,  which  equipment and machinery shall remain the property of
Tenant  and  shall  not  become  part of the real  estate,  provided  that  such
installation  shall not reduce the value of the Premises or its usefulness.  Any
equipment  of Tenant  not  removed  by  Tenant  within  ten (10) days  after the
expiration or earlier termination of this Lease shall be considered abandoned by
Tenant and may be  appropriated,  sold,  destroyed or  otherwise  disposed of by
Landlord  without first giving notice thereof and without  obligation to account
therefor.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this Lease,  Tenant may not
install any equipment which emits electromagnetic, microwave, ultrasonic, laser,
or  other  radiation  which  Landlord  determines  causes a risk to  persons  or
property, or interferes with telecommunications transmissions or computer use.

                  (d) Subject to Landlord's  obligations  to maintain and repair
the Premises in  accordance  with this  Paragraph 14, Tenant agrees that it will
take good care of the  Premises  and the  fixtures  and plate glass  therein and
will, at the expiration or other  termination of the Term hereof,  surrender and
deliver  up the same in like  good  order and  conditions  as the same now is or
shall be at the commencement of the Term hereof, ordinary wear and tear excepted
and shall  repair any damage  caused by its removal of trade  fixtures.  Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Tenant shall promptly make all repairs
to the Premises or to any part of the  Building,  to the extent such repairs are
not covered by  insurance  and if such  repairs are  necessitated  by any act or
omission of Tenant, any subtenant,  assignee or concessionaire of Tenant, any of
its respective  agents or employees,  or by the failure of Tenant to perform any
of its obligations under this Lease.

         15. PARKING AND LOADING AREAS.

                  (a) During the Term of this Lease,  and any  renewal  thereof,
Tenant  shall have,  without  charge,  the right to utilize  two  hundred  (200)
vehicle  parking spaces in the Building's  parking  facilities on a nonexclusive
basis with other  tenants of the  Building,  upon such  non-financial  terms and
conditions  as may  from  time to  time be  established  by  Landlord.  Landlord
reserves the right in its absolute  discretion to determine  whether the parking
facilities are becoming  crowded and to allocate and assign parking spaces among
Tenant and the other tenants.  It is understood and agreed that Landlord assumes
no  responsibility,  and shall not be held liable,  unless  caused by Landlord's
negligence,  for any  damage or loss to any  automobiles  parked in the  parking
facilities  or to any  personal  property  located  therein,  or for any  injury
sustained by any person in or about the parking facilities.

                  (b) During the Term of this Lease,  and any  renewal  thereof,
Tenant shall have, without charge, the right to utilize the paved areas adjacent
to the  Premises  which have been  designed and  constructed  for use as loading
docks to serve the  Premises and to provide  access to the drive-in  door in the
Premises. Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant as a result of any inability of
Tenant to access such docks or  drive-in  door due to the parking of vehicles in
the vicinity of such loading docks and drive-in area, or otherwise.

         16. SIGNAGE.  Tenant shall be entitled to install, at its sole expense,
one (1)  building  mounted  exterior  sign and one (1) monument  sign  providing
identification of Tenant, at Tenant's expense,  subject to Landlord's reasonable
approval as to location,  design, color,  lighting,  and specifications,  and to
applicable Jefferson County regulations and restrictions of record.

         17. EVENT OF DEFAULT.

                  (a) Definition.  As used in the provisions of this Lease, each
of the following events shall constitute,  and is hereinafter referred to as, an
"Event of Default":

                           (i) If Tenant (1) fails to pay Rent,  Additional Rent
or any other  sum which  Tenant is  obligated  to pay by any  provision  of this
Lease,  when and as it is due and payable hereunder and without demand therefor,
or (2) in any  material  respect  violates  any  of  the  terms,  conditions  or
covenants set forth in the provisions of this Lease; or

                           (ii) If Tenant (1)  applies  for or  consents  to the
appointment  of a  receiver,  trustee  or  liquidator  of  Tenant or of all or a
substantial part of its assets,  (2) files a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or
admits in writing its  inability to pay its debts as they come due, (3) makes an
assignment for the benefit of its  creditors,  (4) files a petition or an answer
seeking a  reorganization  or an arrangement  with  creditors,  or seeks to take
advantage of any insolvency  law, (5) performs any other act of  bankruptcy,  or
(6) files an answer  admitting  the  material  allegations  of a  reorganization
insolvency proceeding.

                           (iii) If an order of relief or other order, judgement
or decree is entered by any court of competent jurisdiction  adjudicating Tenant
as  insolvent,  or  otherwise  entitled to the  protection  of or subject to any
bankruptcy  statute,  approving a petition  seeking  such a  reorganization,  or
appointing a receiver,  trustee or  liquidator  of Tenant or otherwise  commence
with respect to Tenant or any of its assets any proceeding under any bankruptcy,
reorganization,  arrangement, insolvency, readjustment,

                                       9

<PAGE>


receivership or similar law, and if such order, judgement,  decree or proceeding
continues  unstayed  for  more  than  sixty  (60)  consecutive  days  after  the
expiration of any stay thereof.

                  (b) Notice to Tenant, Grace Period.  Anything contained in the
provisions  of  this  Paragraph  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,   upon  the
occurrence  of an Event of Default  Tenant shall not be deemed to be in default,
and  Landlord  shall not  exercise  any right or remedy which it holds under any
provision of this Lease or under applicable law unless and until;

                           (i)  Landlord  has given  written  notice  thereof to
Tenant, and

                           (ii) Tenant has failed,  (1) if such Event of Default
consists of the failure to pay money,  within three (3) calendar  days after the
date Landlord presents notice, to pay all of such money,  together with interest
thereon and any late payment  charge which may be due  hereunder of five percent
(5%)  levied on all  monies  due to  Landlord  as of the  Notice of  Default  in
accordance  with  Paragraph  3(g),  or (2) if such Event of Default  consists of
something other than the failure to pay money, within fifteen (15) business days
thereafter to commence actively, diligently and in good faith to proceed to cure
such Event of Default and to continue to do so until it is fully cured; provided
however,  if Tenant  commences  to cure such  default  during such  fifteen (15)
business day period, and such default cannot be cured within such period despite
diligent effort, Tenant shall be afforded such additional time as may reasonably
required to effect a cure  provided that Tenant  continues to diligently  pursue
such cure.

                           (iii) No such notice  shall be  required,  and Tenant
shall be entitled to no such grace  period,  (1) more than twice with respect to
monetary  default  during each twelve (12) month  period of the Term,  or (2) if
Tenant  has  substantially  terminated  or is in the  process  of  substantially
terminating its continuous occupancy and use of the Premises for the purpose set
forth  in the  provisions  of  Paragraph  5,  or (3) if  any  Event  of  Default
enumerated in the  provisions of Paragraphs  17(a)(ii),  17(a)(iii) or 17(b)(ii)
has occurred.

                  (c)  Landlord's  Rights  upon  Event  of  Default.   Upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default,  Landlord,  at its option, may terminate this
Lease, and with our without terminating this Lease, may pursue any and all other
remedies  available  to it  under  the  laws of the  Commonwealth  of  Kentucky,
including, by way of example rather than of limitation, the rights to:

                           (i) re-enter and repossess the Premises,  with lawful
force, and any and all improvements thereon and additions thereto;

                           (ii) at  Landlord's  option,  immediately  recover an
amount  equal to the present  value (as of the date of Tenant's  default) of the
Base Rent and  Additional  Rent which  would have become due through the date on
which the Lease Term would have expired but for Tenant's default,  which damages
shall be  payable to  Landlord  in a lump sum on demand.  For  purposes  of this
Section,  present value shall be computed by  discounting at a rate equal to one
(1) whole percent point above the "prime rate" then in effect at Morgan Guaranty
Trust  Company  of  New  York,  and  collect  such  balance  in any  manner  not
inconsistent with applicable law; and/or

                           (iii) relet any or all of the  Premises  for Tenant's
account for any or all of the  remainder of the Lease Term,  or pay to Landlord,
any  deficiency  in the Rent and any other sum which  Tenant is obligated to pay
resulting,  with respect to such remainder,  from such reletting, as well as the
out-of-pocket  cost to Landlord of any reasonable  fees relating to reletting of
the Premises  including but not limited to construction  costs,  brokerage fees,
reasonable  attorney's fees or of any repairs or other action  (including  those
taken in exercising  Landlord's  rights under any provision of this Lease) taken
by Landlord on account of such Event of Default.

Landlord's  rights and  remedies set forth in this Lease are  cumulative  and in
addition to Landlord's other rights and remedies at law or in equity,  including
those available as a result of any anticipatory breach of this Lease. Landlord's
exercise  of any such  right or  remedy  shall not  prevent  the  concurrent  or
subsequent exercise of any other right or remedy. Landlord's delay or failure to
exercise or enforce any of Landlord's rights or remedies or Tenant's obligations
shall not  constitute  a waiver of any such  rights,  remedies  or  obligations.
Landlord  shall not be deemed to have  waived any  default  unless  such  waiver
expressly set forth in an instrument  signed by Landlord.  Any such waiver shall
not be  construed  as a waiver of any  covenant  or  condition  except as to the
specific circumstances  described in such waiver. Neither Tenant's payment of an
amount less than a sum due nor Tenant's endorsement or statement on any check or
letter  accompanying  such payment  shall be deemed an accord and  satisfaction.
Notwithstanding  any request or  designation  by Tenant,  Landlord may apply any
payment  received  from Tenant to any payment then due.  Landlord may accept the
same without prejudice to Landlord's right to recover the balance of such sum or
to  pursue  other  remedies.  Re-entry  and  acceptance  of  keys  shall  not be
considered an acceptance of a surrender of this Lease.

                  (d) Right of  Landlord  to Cure  Tenant's  Default.  If Tenant
defaults in the  performance of any of its  obligations  under this Lease,  then
Landlord shall have the right (but not the duty) to perform such obligation, and
Tenant shall  reimburse  Landlord for any costs and expenses  thereby  incurred,
together with interest  thereon at that rate per annum which is two

                                       10

<PAGE>
percent (2%)  greater  than the "prime  rate" then in effect at Morgan  Guaranty
Trust Company of New York, from the date such costs and expenses are incurred by
Landlord  to the date of  payment  thereof by Tenant;  provided,  however,  that
nothing herein  contained  shall be construed or implemented in such a manner as
to allow  Landlord to charge or receive  interest in excess of the maximum legal
rate then allowed by law. Such payment and interest shall constitute  Additional
Rent hereunder, which shall be due and payable with the next monthly installment
of Rent; but the making of such payment or the taking of such action by Landlord
shall not operate to cure such default or to stop  Landlord  from the pursuit of
any remedy to which Landlord would otherwise be entitled.

                  (e)  Lien  on  Personal  Property.  Pursuant  to KRS  383.070,
Landlord shall have a lien on all of Tenant's  tangible and intangible  personal
property  now or  hereafter  located  upon the Premises to secure the payment of
four (4) months' rent.  Landlord's  rights and remedies provided in this section
shall be in  addition  to,  and not in lieu of, any other  rights  and  remedies
available  to  Landlord  pursuant  to the  terms of this  Lease or  pursuant  to
applicable law.

                  (f)  No  Waiver.  If  Landlord  institutes  legal  proceedings
against  Tenant as to any matter under this Lease and a compromise or settlement
is made, Landlord shall not be deemed to have waived any rights under this Lease
except  as  explicitly  set  forth in a written  agreement  signed  by  Landlord
evidencing such compromise or settlement. No waiver by Landlord of any breach of
any covenant, condition, or agreement in this Lease shall operate as a waiver of
such  covenant or  condition  itself or of any  subsequent  breach  thereof.  No
payment by Tenant or receipt by  Landlord  of a lesser  amount  than the monthly
installments  of Rent  herein  stipulated  shall be  deemed  to be other  than a
payment on  account,  nor shall any  endorsement  or  statement  on any check or
letter  accompanying  a check  for  payment  of Rent be  deemed  an  accord  and
satisfaction, and Landlord may accept such check prepayment without prejudice to
Landlord's  right to  recover  the  balance  of such Rent or to pursue any other
remedy  provided in the Lease.  No re-entry by Landlord,  and no  acceptance  by
Landlord of keys from Tenant,  shall be  considered an acceptance of a surrender
of the Lease.

         18. HOLDING OVER. Tenant  acknowledges  that it is extremely  important
that Landlord have  substantial  advance notice of the date on which Tenant will
vacate the Premises,  because  Landlord will (a) require an extensive  period to
locate a  replacement  tenant,  and (b) plan its entire  leasing and  renovation
program for the Building in reliance on its lease expiration dates.  Tenant also
acknowledges that if Tenant fails to surrender the Premises at the expiration or
earlier  termination of the Lease Term,  then it will be  conclusively  presumed
that the value to Tenant of remaining in  possession,  and the loss that will be
suffered  by  Landlord  as a  result  thereof,  far  exceed  the  Base  Rent and
Additional Rent that would have been payable had the Lease Term continued during
such holdover period.  Therefore,  if Tenant (or anyone claiming through Tenant)
does not  immediately  surrender  the  Premises or any portion  thereof upon the
expiration  or earlier  termination  of the Lease  Term,  then the rent shall be
increased to equal the greater of (1) the fair market rent for the Premises,  or
two hundred percent (200%) of the Base Rent, Additional Rent and other sums that
would have been payable  pursuant to the  provisions  of this Lease if the Lease
Term had continued during such holdover  period.  Such rent shall be computed by
Landlord  on a  monthly  basis  and  shall be  payable  on the first day of such
holdover period and the first day of each calendar month thereafter  during such
holdover period until the Premises have been vacated.  Notwithstanding any other
provision  of this Lease,  Landlord's  acceptance  of such rent shall not in any
manner  adversely  affect  Landlord's  other  rights  and  remedies,   including
Landlord's right to evict Tenant and to recover all damages.  Any holdover shall
be deemed to be a  tenancy-at-sufferance  and not a  tenancy-at-will  or tenancy
from month-to-month;  provided,  however,  that Landlord may, in addition to its
other  remedies,  elect, in its sole  discretion,  to treat such holdover as the
creation of a month-to-month tenancy with Tenant. In no event shall any holdover
be deemed a  permitted  extension  or renewal  of the Lease  Term,  and  nothing
contained  herein  shall be construed to  constitute  Landlord's  consent to any
holdover or to give Tenant any right with respect  thereto.  Except as otherwise
specifically  provided in this Article,  all terms of this Lease shall remain in
full force and effect during the holdover period.

         19.  LANDLORD'S  RIGHT  OF  ENTRY.  Landlord  and its  agents  shall be
entitled to enter the Premises at any reasonable  time,  with  reasonable  prior
notice except in emergency,

                  (a) To inspect the Premises;

                  (b) To exhibit  the  Premises to any  existing or  prospective
purchaser or mortgagee  thereof or, during the last nine (9) months of the Term,
any prospective tenant thereof;

                  (c)  To  make  any   reasonable   and  necessary   alteration,
improvement or repair to the Premises; or

                  (d) For any other reasonable purpose relating to the operation
or  maintenance of the Premises;  provided,  that Landlord shall (i) give Tenant
reasonable  prior notice of its intention to enter the  Premises,  except in the
case of emergency,  and (ii) use reasonable efforts to avoid thereby interfering
any more than is reasonably necessary with Tenant's use and enjoyment thereof.

         20. LIABILITY, TENANT'S INDEMNITY, INSURANCE.

                  (a)  Landlord  shall  not be  liable  for,  and  Tenant  shall
indemnify  and hold  Landlord  harmless  from and against,  any injury,  loss or
damage of whatever nature to any persons or property arising within the Premises
unless caused by the willful act or gross  negligence  of Landlord,  its agents,
employees  or  contractors.  Commencing  with the date on which the Premises are
made  available to Tenant and continuing  thereafter  throughout the Lease Term,
Tenant shall maintain,  at its sole expense,  (i) general  comprehensive  public
liability  insurance,  including  bodily injury,  property damage or other loss,
insuring Tenant,  Landlord,  Landlord's Lender,  and Landlord's  appointed agent
with respect to the Premises and their appurtenances,  in a company or companies
reasonably  satisfactory  to Landlord,  in an amount not less than Three Million
Dollars ($3,000,000),  (ii) all-risk property and casualty insurance,  including
theft,  written at replacement cost value and with replacement cost endorsement,
covering all of Tenant's personal property in the Premises, and (iii) if, and to
the extent required by law, worker's  compensation or similar insurance offering
statutory  coverage and containing  statutory limits.  All such insurance shall:
(1) be issued by a company  that is licensed to do business in the  jurisdiction
in which the Building is located,  that has been approved in advance by Landlord
and that has a rating equal to or exceeding  A:XI from Best's  Insurance  Guide;
(2) name  Landlord,  its managing agent (or its successor) and the holder of any
Mortgage as  additional  insureds  and/or loss  payees as  applicable  (as their
interests  may  appear),  except  that the  liability  insurance  shall not name
Landlord's Mortgage holder as an additional insured;  (3) contain an endorsement
that such insurance shall remain in full force and effect  notwithstanding  that
the  insured  may have  waived its right of action  against any person or entity
prior to the occurrence of a loss (Tenant hereby waiving its right of action and
recovery against and releasing Landlord and its employees,  affiliates, partners
and agents  from any and all  liabilities,  claims and losses for which they may
otherwise  be liable to the extent  Tenant is covered  by  insurance  carried or
required to be carried  under this Lease);  (4) provide that the insurer  waives
all right of recovery by way of  subrogation  against  Landlord,  its  partners,
affiliates,  agents and  employees,  (5) be  acceptable  in form and  content to
Landlord;  (6) be primary and  non-contributory;  and (7) contain an endorsement
prohibiting cancellation,  failure to renew, reduction in amount of insurance or
change of  coverage  (A) as to the  interests  of  Landlord or the holder of the
Mortgage  by  reason of any act or  omission  of  Tenant,  and (B)  without  the
insurer's giving Landlord thirty (30) days' prior written notice of such action.
No such  policy  shall  contain any  deductible  provision  except as  otherwise
approved  in writing  by  Landlord,  which  approval  shall not be  unreasonably
withheld.  Landlord  reserves  the right from time to time to require  Tenant to
obtain higher  minimum  amounts or different  types of  insurance.  Tenant shall
deliver a certificate of all such insurance and receipts  evidencing  payment of
the  premium for such  insurance  (and,  upon  request,  copies of all  required
insurance  policies,   including  endorsements  and  declarations)  to  Landlord
concurrently  with  Tenant's  execution  of this  Lease  and at  least  annually
thereafter.

                           In  addition,  Tenant  shall  require any  contractor
retained by it to perform any  Alteration  to carry and  maintain at Tenant's or
such  contractor's  expense  (and furnish the policy,  policies or  certificates
thereof to Landlord and  Landlord's  Lender)  during such times as contractor is
working in the Premises,  (i) comprehensive  general liability insurance policy,
including,  but not limited to,  contractor's  liability  coverage,  contractual
liability  coverage,  complete operations  coverage,  broad form property damage
endorsement and contractor's protective liability coverage, to afford protection
with  limits per person and for each  occurrence,  of not less than One  Million
Dollars ($1,000,000), combined single limit, with respect to personal injury and
death and property damage, such insurance to provide for no deductible,  to name
Landlord  and  Landlord's  Lender  as  additional  insureds  and  (ii)  worker's
compensation  insurance or similar  insurance in form and amounts as required by
law.

                           Landlord  shall maintain  insurance  coverage for the
Building,  the cost of such insurance shall be an Operating Cost for purposes of
Paragraph  11  hereof,  in such  amounts  and  with  such  carriers  as shall be
reasonable and necessary from time to time  including (a) fire  insurance,  with
standard extended coverage  endorsement  including  demolition costs,  increased
costs of construction,  and contingent  liability from changes in building codes
on the Premises, in an amount not less than the full replacement value from time
to time of the Premises; (b) flood insurance in an amount Landlord may from time
to time reasonably require, if the Premises are located in an area designated as
"flood prone" pursuant to the national Flood Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood
Disaster Protection Act; (c) difference-in-conditions  coverage (including flood
and earthquake to the extent  available) to the extent not covered under (a) and
(b) above, in an amount Landlord from time to time may reasonably  require;  (d)
rental value  insurance in an amount equal to one (1) year gross rent; (e) steam
boiler and machinery breakdown direct damage insurance and third-party liability
coverage  (if  applicable  and if not covered  under the  comprehensive  general
liability policy), with full comprehensive  coverage on a repair and replacement
cost basis,  for all boilers and  machinery  which form a part of the  Premises,
including business interruption  insurance in connection therewith in accordance
with (d) above;  and (f) such other  insurance as Landlord  may require  against
such other  insurable  hazards which at the time are customary and prudent under
the circumstances.

                  (b) All damages to the  Premises or the Building of which they
are a part, caused by Tenant, or the agents, servants, employees and invitees of
Tenant, will be repaired by Landlord at the expense of Tenant, to the extent not
covered by insurance  proceeds,  with the right on the part of Landlord to elect
in its  discretion  to regard the same as  Additional  Rent, in which event such
cost or charge shall become Additional Rent payable with the installment of Rent
next becoming due or thereafter  falling due under the terms of this Lease. This
provision shall be construed as an additional remedy granted to Landlord and not
in limitation of any other rights and remedies which Landlord has or may have in
said circumstances.

                                       12

<PAGE>


                  (c) All personal  property of Tenant in the Premises or in the
Building  of which the  Premises  is a part shall be at the sole risk of Tenant.
Landlord  shall not be liable for any  accident to or damage to the  property of
Tenant resulting from the use or operation of the heating,  cooling,  electrical
or plumbing  apparatus  or any other  cause  whatsoever.  Landlord  shall not be
liable in damages,  nor shall this Lease be affected,  for conditions arising or
resulting,  and which may affect the  Building of which the  Premises is a part,
due to construction on contiguous premises unless such construction  renders the
Premises untenantable or of no practical use for Tenant's purposes.

                  (d) Landlord assumes no liability or responsibility whatsoever
in the conduct and  operations  of the business to be conducted in the Premises.
Landlord  shall not be liable  for any  accident  to or injury to any  person or
persons or property in or about the Premises which are caused by the conduct and
operation  of said  business or by virtue of  equipment or property of Tenant in
said Premises.

                  (e) Except to the extent  caused by the willful  misconduct or
gross  negligence of Landlord,  its agents or employees,  Landlord shall have no
liability to Tenant,  its employees,  agents,  invitees,  licensees,  customers,
clients, family members or guests for any damage,  compensation or claim arising
from the repair by Landlord of any portion of the Premises or the Building,  any
interruption in the use of the Premises,  accident or damage  resulting from the
use or operation (by Landlord,  Tenant or any other person) of heating, cooling,
electrical or plumbing  equipment or apparatus,  or from  untenantability of the
Premises  resulting from fire or other casualty subject to Paragraph 13, or from
any robbery, theft, mysterious  disappearance and/or any other casualty, or from
any  leakage in any part or portion of the  Premises  or the  Building,  or from
water, rain or snow that may leak into or flow from any part of the Premises, or
from drains,  pipes or plumbing  work in the  Building,  or from any other cause
whatsoever.  Any goods, property or personal effects, stored or placed by Tenant
in or about the Premises shall be at the risk of Tenant,  and Landlord shall not
in any manner be held  responsible  therefor.  The  employees  of  Landlord  are
prohibited  from  receiving  any  packages or other  articles  delivered  to the
Premises  for Tenant,  and if any such  employee  receives  any such  package or
article,  at the request of Tenant,  such employee  shall be the agent of Tenant
for such purposes and not of Landlord.

         21.  WAIVER  OF  SUBROGATION.   If  either  party  hereto  is  paid  or
indemnified by any proceeds  under any policy of insurance  naming such party as
an insured (or would have been paid or  indemnified  by such  proceeds if it had
maintained  all of the  insurance  coverages it is required  under this Lease to
maintain),  on account of any loss, damage or liability,  then such party hereby
releases the other party hereto from any and all liability for such loss, damage
or liability, notwithstanding that such loss, damage or liability, may arise out
of the negligent act or omission of the other party, its agents or employees.

         22. EMINENT DOMAIN.

                  (a) If any or all of the Premises are taken by the exercise of
any  power of  eminent  domain or are  conveyed  to or at the  direction  of any
governmental  entity  under a  threat  of any  such  taking  (each  of  which is
hereinafter referred to as a "Condemnation"),  Landlord, subject to subparagraph
(c) below shall be entitled to collect from the condemning  authority thereunder
the entire amount of any award made in any such  proceeding or as  consideration
for such deed,  without  deduction  therefrom  for any leasehold or other estate
held by Tenant by virtue of this Lease.

                  (b)  Tenant,  subject to  subparagraph  (c) below,  hereby (i)
assigns to Landlord all of Tenant's right, title and interest, if any, in and to
any such award,  (ii) waives any right which it may otherwise have in connection
with such Condemnation,  against Landlord or such condemning  authority,  to any
payment  for (a) the  value of the  then  unexpired  portion  of the  Term,  (b)
leasehold  damages (except the unamortized  portion of any improvements paid for
by Tenant and title to which is  retained by Tenant,  provided  such amount does
not diminish  and/or delay any award or payment which Landlord  would  otherwise
receive as a result of such  condemnation),  and (c) any damage to or diminution
of the value of  Tenant's  leasehold  interest  hereunder  or any portion of the
Premises not covered by such  Condemnation;  and (iii) agrees to execute any and
all  further  documents  which  may be  required  in  order  to  facilitate  the
Landlord's collection of any and all such awards.

                  (c)   Notwithstanding   the   foregoing   provisions  of  this
Paragraph,  Tenant may seek a separate  award, so long as such separate award in
no way  diminishes  and/or  delays any award or  payment  which  Landlord  would
otherwise receive as a result of such Condemnation.

         23. EFFECT OF CONDEMNATION.

                  (a) If (i) all of the Premises are covered by a  Condemnation,
or (ii)  if any  part of the  Premises  is  covered  by a  Condemnation  and the
remainder  thereof  is  insufficient  for the  reasonable  operation  therein of
Tenant's  business,  or (iii) any of the  Building is covered by a  Condemnation
and, in Landlord's  reasonable  opinion,  reasonably  concurred in by Tenant, it
would be impractical to restore the remainder thereof,  then, in any such event,
the Term shall  terminate  on the date upon which  possession  of so much of the
Premises as is covered by such Condemnation is taken by the condemning authority
thereunder,  and  all  Rent  (including,  by  way  of  example  rather  than  of

                  (b) If there is a Condemnation and the Term does not terminate
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Paragraph, the operation and effect
of this Lease shall be  unaffected  by such  Condemnation,  except that the Base
Monthly Rent  payable  under the  provisions  of Paragraph 3 shall be reduced in
proportion  to the  square  footage,  if any,  of the  Premises  covered by such
Condemnation.

                  (c)  If  there  is a  Condemnation,  Landlord  shall  have  no
liability to Tenant on account of any (i) interruption of Tenant's business upon
the Premises,  (ii) diminution in Tenant's ability to use the Premises, or (iii)
other injury or damage sustained by Tenant as a result of such Condemnation.

                  (d)  Except  for  any  separate  award  to  Tenant  under  the
provisions of Paragraph  22(c),  Landlord  shall be entitled to conduct any such
condemnation  proceeding and any settlement  thereof free of  interference  from
Tenant,  and Tenant  hereby  waives any right which it might  otherwise  have to
participate therein.

         24.  MECHANIC'S AND MATERIALMEN'S  LIENS.  Tenant shall bond, remove or
have  removed  any  mechanic's,  materialmen's  or other  lien  filed or claimed
against any or all of the Premises, by reason of labor or materials provided for
or at the request of Tenant or any of its contractors or  subcontractors  within
thirty (30) days of notice of filing said lien.

         25. QUIET ENJOYMENT.  Landlord hereby covenants that Tenant,  on paying
the  Rent  and  performing  the  covenants  set  forth  herein,   shall  without
interference from Landlord peaceably and quietly hold and enjoy,  throughout the
Term,  (i) the Premises,  and (ii) such rights as Tenant may hold hereunder with
respect to the Premises.

         26. SURRENDER.

                  (a) Upon the  expiration or earlier  termination  of the Term,
Tenant shall  surrender the Premises to Landlord in good order,  cleanliness and
repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

                  (b)  Subject  to   Paragraph   14(c)   hereof,   any  and  all
improvements,  repairs,  alterations and all other property attached to, used in
connection with or otherwise installed upon the Premises (i) shall,  immediately
upon the  completion  of the  installation  thereof,  be and  become  Landlord's
property without payment therefor by Landlord,  and (ii) shall be surrendered to
Landlord upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Term, except that any
machinery,  equipment or fixtures installed by Tenant and used in the conduct of
Tenant's  trade or business  (rather than to service the Premises)  shall remain
Tenant's  property and shall be removed by Tenant within five (5) days after the
expiration or earlier  termination  of the Term,  and Tenant shall  promptly and
thereafter  fully  restore any of the Premises or the  Building  damaged by such
installation or removal thereof.

         27. SUBORDINATION.  This Lease is subject and subordinate to all ground
or underlying leases and to all mortgages and/or deeds of trust which may now or
hereafter  affect such leases or the real  property of which the Premises form a
part,(the  "Mortgage")  and  to  all  renewals,  modifications,  consolidations,
re-castings,  replacements and extensions thereof. The holder of the Mortgage to
which this Lease is subordinate shall have the right at any time to declare this
Lease to be  superior  to the lien,  provisions,  operation  and  effect of such
Mortgage  and Tenant  shall  execute,  acknowledge  and deliver  all  confirming
documents   required  by  such  holder.   In   confirmation   of  the  foregoing
subordination, Tenant shall at Landlord's request promptly execute any requisite
or appropriate document.  Tenant appoints Landlord as Tenant's  attorney-in-fact
to execute any such  document  for Tenant if Tenant fails to execute same within
ten (10) business days after request  therefor.  Tenant waives the provisions of
any statute or rule of law now or  hereafter in effect which may give or purport
to give Tenant any right to terminate or otherwise  adversely  affect this Lease
or  Tenant's  obligations  in the  event  any  such  foreclosure  proceeding  is
prosecuted or completed or in the event the Property, the Building or Landlord's
interest  therein  is  sold  at a  foreclosure  sale  or  by  deed  in  lieu  of
foreclosure.  If  this  Lease  is not  extinguished  upon  such  sale  or by the
purchaser  following such sale,  then, at the request of such purchaser,  Tenant
shall  attorn  to such  purchaser  and shall  recognize  such  purchaser  as the
landlord under this Lease.  Upon such attornment such purchaser shall not be (a)
bound by any payment of the Base Rent or Additional Rent more than one (1) month
in advance, (b) bound by any amendment of this Lease made without the consent of
the holder of the Mortgage existing as of the date of such amendment, (c) liable
for  damages  for any breach,  act or  omission  of any prior  landlord,  or (d)
subject to any offset or  defenses  which  Tenant  might have  against any prior
landlord.  Within five (5) business days after  receipt,  Tenant shall  execute,
acknowledge  and deliver any  requisite  or  appropriate  document  submitted to
Tenant confirming such attornment.

         28. ESTOPPEL CERTIFICATE.  Landlord and Tenant agree from time to time,
upon not less than ten (10)  business  days' prior  written  notice by the other
party,  to execute,  acknowledge and deliver to such party or to any existing or
prospective  owner or mortgagee of the Building or land upon which such Building
has been built, or any interest in either, a statement in writing (a) certifying
that this  Lease is  unmodified  and in full  force and effect (or if there have
been  modifications,  stating  the  modifications  and that the Lease is in full
force and effect as  modified),  (b) stating the dates to which the Rent and any
other charges hereunder have been paid by Tenant, (c) stating whether or not, to
the knowledge of such party, the other party is in default in the performance of
any  covenant,  agreement  or  condition  contained  in this  Lease,  and if so,
specifying each such default of which such

                                       14

<PAGE>


party may have  knowledge,  (d)  stating  that  Tenant  shall give notice to any
mortgagee  prior to  seeking  to  terminate  the  Lease by  reason of any act or
omission  of Landlord  until such  mortgagee  has had  reasonable  time,  at its
option,  to remedy  such act or  omission,  and (e) stating the address to which
notices to Tenant,  or Landlord,  as the case may be,  should be sent.  Any such
statement may be relied upon by any existing or  prospective  owner or mortgagee
of the Building or  aforesaid  land or any interest in either or any assignee of
any such person.

         29. NOTICES.  Any notice,  demand,  consent,  approval request or other
communication or document to be provided  hereunder to a party hereto,  shall be
in  writing  and  shall be  deemed to have been  provided  after  being  sent by
certified or registered  mail,  return receipt  requested,  in the United States
mail or by personal delivery or commercial courier, against receipt. Any and all
notices  or  other  communications  to  Landlord  and  Tenant  shall be given as

                  (b)  Amendment.  This  Lease may be  amended by and only by an
instrument executed and delivered by each party hereto.

                  (c)  Applicable  Law.  This  Lease  shall be given  effect and

                  (e) Headings. The headings of the Paragraphs and subparagraphs
hereof are provided herein for and only for convenience or reference,  and shall
not be considered in construing their contents.

                  (f) Exhibits. Each writing or plat referred to herein as being
attached  hereto as an  exhibit  or  otherwise  designated  herein as an exhibit
hereto is hereby made a part hereof.

                  (g) Severability.  No determination by any court, governmental
body or otherwise  that any provision of this Lease or any  amendment  hereof is
invalid  or   unenforceable  in  any  instance  shall  affect  the  validity  or
enforceability of (i) any other provision thereof, or (ii) such provision in any
circumstance not controlled by such determination.  Each such provision shall be
valid and  enforceable  to the fullest extent allowed by, and shall be construed
wherever possible as being consistent with, applicable law.

                  (h)  Definition  of  "Landlord".  As  used  herein,  the  term
"Landlord"  means the entity  hereinabove  named as such, and its successors and
assigns.

                  (i) Definition of "Tenant".  As used herein, the term "Tenant"
means each person  hereinabove  named as such and such person's heirs,  personal
representatives,  successors  and  assigns,  each of whom  shall  have  the same
obligations,  liabilities,  rights and privileges as it would have possessed had
it originally  executed this Lease,  that no such right or privilege shall inure
to the  benefit of any  assignee  of  Tenant,  immediate  or remote,  unless the
assignment  to such  assignee  is made in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of
Paragraph 12. Whenever two or more persons  constitute  Tenant, all such persons
shall  be  jointly  and  severally   liable  for  the  performance  of  Tenant's
obligations hereunder.

                  (j)  Successors.  It is agreed that all rights,  remedies  and

extend to their  respective  heirs,  executors,  administrators,  successors and
assigns.

hereby  releases the Premises to Tenant in accordance with the provision of this
Lease. Tenant hereby accepts this Lease.

                  (l) Force Majeure.  In the event that Landlord or Tenant shall
be delayed,  or hindered,  or prevented from the performance of any act required
hereunder  (except  for  the  payment  of  monies),   by  reason  of  government
restrictions,  scarcity of labor or materials,  or for other reasons  beyond its
reasonable control,  the performance of such act shall be excused for the period
of delay and the period for the  performance  of any such act shall be  extended
for a period equivalent to the period of such delay.

                  (m) Recordation.  The parties agree to execute a short form of
this Lease,  which may, at Landlord's  sole option,  be recorded  among the land
records of the jurisdiction where the Premises are located.  The expense thereof
shall be borne by Landlord.

                  (n) Tenant's Authority.  Tenant hereby warrants and represents
that each individual executing this Lease on behalf of Tenant is duly authorized
to  execute  and  deliver  this  Lease  and  that  Tenant  is a  duly  organized
corporation  under the laws of  Delaware,  is  qualified  to do  business in the
Commonwealth  of  Kentucky,  and has the power and  authority to enter into this
Lease,  and that all action  requisite  to  authorize  Tenant to enter into this
Lease has been duly taken.

                  (o) Commission. Landlord and Tenant warrant that they have not
had any  dealings  with any  realtor,  broker  or agent in  connection  with the
negotiation of this Lease, except for Capstone Realty, Inc. and CB Richard Ellis
Nicklies  ("Brokers") whose commission shall be paid for by Landlord pursuant to
the terms of a separate  agreement between Landlord and the Brokers.  Should any
claim for a commission be established by any other broker or agent,  the parties
hereby  expressly agree to hold one another harmless with respect thereto to the
extent that one or the other is shown to have been  responsible for the creation
of such claim.

                  (p) No Representations By Landlord.  Tenant  acknowledges that
neither  Landlord  or any broker,  agent or  employee  of Landlord  has made any
representations  or promises with respect to the Premises or the Building except
as herein  expressly  set  forth,  and no  rights,  privileges,  assessments  or
licenses are acquired by Tenant except as herein expressly provided.

                  (q)  Authority of Landlord.  Landlord  hereby  represents  and
warrants that it is a corporation  duly organized and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Delaware,  that each  individual or entity  executing  this
Lease on  behalf  of  Landlord  is  authorized  to do so,  and  that all  action
necessary to authorize Landlord to enter into this Lease has been duly taken.

                  (r)  Third-Party  Consents.  Landlord  hereby  represents  and
warrants that (i) the execution and delivery of this Lease by Landlord,  and the
performance of Landlord's obligations hereunder,  do not conflict with or result
in any breach under the terms of  Landlord's  articles of  incorporation  or any
agreement to which  Landlord is a party or by which  Landlord or the Premises is
bound and (ii) all consents of any third parties,  including without  limitation
any ground lessor or mortgagee of the Premises,

                                       16

<PAGE>


required in  connection  with the execution and delivery of this Lease have been
obtained by Landlord, and Landlord shall furnish evidence of such consents.

                  (s)  Litigation.   The  prevailing  party  shall  recover  all
reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by or on behalf of such prevailing
party if (i) either party  institutes  litigation  for a breach of the terms and
conditions of this Lease, (ii) either party institutes litigation for possession
of the Premises, or (iii) either party is made party to litigation instituted by
a third party relating to Premises. Such attorney's fees and costs may be levied
against the party whose conduct  necessitated  the use of an attorney whether or
not litigation is prosecuted to judgement.

                  (t)  Assignment  by Landlord.  Landlord may freely  assign its
interest  hereunder.  The term  "Landlord"  as used herein shall be deemed to be
related  only to a person or entity  during the time of his or its  ownership of
Landlord's interest in this Lease.

                  (u) Waiver of Jury Trial.  LANDLORD  AND TENANT WAIVE TRIAL BY
JURY  IN  ANY  ACTION,   CLAIM  OR  COUNTERCLAIM   BROUGHT  IN  CONNECTION  WITH
LANDLORD-TENANT  RELATIONSHIP,  TENANT'S USE OR OCCUPANCY OF THE PREMISES OR ANY
CLAIM OF INJURY OR  DAMAGE.  Tenant  consents  to  service  of  process  and any
pleading relating to any such action at the Premises;  provided,  however,  that
nothing  herein shall be construed  as requiring  such service at the  Premises.
Landlord and Tenant waive any  objection to the venue of any action filed in any
court  situated in the  jurisdiction  in which the Building is located and waive
any right under the  doctrine of forum non  conveniens  or otherwise to transfer
any such action filed in any such court to any other court.

                  (v)  Modifications.  In  the  event  any  lender  to  Landlord
requires,  as a condition  to  financing,  modifications  to this  Lease,  then,
provided such  modifications  do not materially alter the approved working plans
and do not  increase  the  Rent  to be  paid  hereunder,  or  increase  Tenant's
obligations or liabilities under this Lease or decrease the benefits accruing to
Tenant hereunder,  Landlord shall submit to Tenant a written amendment with such
required  modifications.  Tenant shall have the right to approve such amendment,
which approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld. If Tenant unreasonably fails
to execute and return the same within ten (10) business days after the amendment
has been  submitted,  then Landlord may elect to execute such  amendment and may
bring an action for specific performance to require the same.


         IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  each party hereto has executed this Lease, or has
caused it to be executed on its behalf by its duly  authorized  representatives,
the day and year first above written.

                            CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
                         (OPERATING COSTS AND TAX AUDIT)

         THIS  CONFIDENTIALITY  AGREEMENT (the  "Agreement") is made and entered
into this ____ day  of____________,  199___ by and between  Louisville  Commerce
Realty Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Landlord"),  Electronic Arts, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Tenant") and ________________________ ("Contractor").

                                    Preamble

         Pursuant to the  provisions of that certain Lease between  Landlord and
Tenant,  dated as of April ___, 1999,  (the  "Lease"),  Tenant was provided with
certain  limited  rights to audit the annual  Operating  Costs and Tax (as those
terms are defined in the Lease). In this regard, Tenant has engaged the services
of Contractor  to perform an audit of the  Operating  Costs and Tax for the ____
Calendar  Year  ( the  "Audit").  In  connection  with  the  Audit,  Tenant  and
Contractor  will  be  given  access  to  various  documents,   files  and  other
information  relating  to the  Operating  Costs  and Tax for  their  review  and
inspection (the "Confidential  Information").  The Confidential  Information may
include  economic,  commercial,  marketing  and  financial  information  that is
confidential and/or proprietary in nature. Therefore, Landlord has determined to
require  Tenant and  Contractor  to execute  and  deliver  this  Agreement  as a
condition of their review and inspection of the Confidential Information.

         In consideration of being granted the opportunity to review and inspect
the Confidential Information, Tenant and Contractor agree as follows:

                                    Agreement

         Section 1. Purpose.  Tenant and Contractor  agree that their review and
inspection of the Confidential  Information shall be solely to conduct an audit,
on  Tenant's  behalf  and  not as an  agent,  representative  or  broker  of any
undisclosed  party,  to verify the accuracy of  Operating  Costs and Tax for the
_____ Calendar Year which Tenant paid under the Lease.

         Section 2. Non-Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information.

         (a) Tenant and Contractor  agree that,  except as set forth below,  all
Confidential  Information  shall be used by Tenant and Contractor solely for the
purposes stated in Section 1 hereof.  Tenant and Contractor further agree not to
disclose any of the Confidential  Information  without the prior written consent
of Landlord to any third party  other than to their  respective  (i)  employees,
officers,  directors, and (ii) agents and representatives,  including attorneys,
accountants and financial advisors  (collectively,  the  "Representatives"),  in
each  case  who (i)  have a need to know the  Confidential  Information  for the
limited  purpose  stated  in  Section 1 hereof,  and (ii) have  entered  into an
agreement  with  Tenant  and  Contractor  substantially  in  the  form  of  this
Agreement.

         (b) The term "Confidential  Information" shall not include  information
which:  (a) is already known to Tenant or Contractor from  non-Landlord  sources
not  known  by  Tenant  or  Contractor  to be  subject  to  any  confidentiality
obligations  to Landlord;  (b) is or becomes  generally  available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure  by Tenant or  Contractor or any of their
Representatives;  or (c) is required to be disclosed by law or by  regulatory or
judicial process.

         (c) In the event Tenant or Contractor  or any of their  Representatives
fails in any respect to comply with its obligations under this Agreement, Tenant
and  Contractor  shall be liable to Landlord  for breach of this  Agreement.  In
addition,  in  the  event  of any  such  failure,  Landlord  may,  in  its  sole
discretion,  refuse to allow  Tenant  the  opportunity  to perform an audit with
respect to any other Calendar Years.

         (d) The  rights,  powers and  remedies  provided  for in the  preceding
subsection  (c) shall be in addition to and do not  preclude the exercise of any
other right,  power or remedy  available to Landlord under law or in equity.  No
forbearance,  failure or delay in  exercising  any such  right,  power or remedy
shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude its further exercise.

         Section  3.  Review  of  Confidential  Information.   The  Confidential
Information will be made available for review by appointment only, at a location
determined by Landlord,  to  Representatives  of Tenant and/or  Contractor whose
duties  include the review and  inspection of such  information in other similar
transactions or evaluations for Tenant.

         Section 4.  Duplication.  Tenant and  Contractor  agree to refrain from
making  any  reproductions,  other  than  handwritten  summaries  or  notes  and
self-generated computer records, of any item of Confidential Information without
the prior written consent of Landlord.

         Section 5. Limited Access.  Tenant and Contractor  shall inform each of
their  Representatives that receives any of the Confidential  Information of the
requirements  of this  Agreement and shall require each such  Representative  to
comply with such requirements.

<PAGE>


         Section  6.  Tenant  Contact.   Tenant  and  Contractor  agree  not  to
communicate with any other tenants in the Project known as Commerce Distribution
Center  in  connection  with the Audit  without  the prior  written  consent  of
Landlord.

         Section 7.  Entire  Agreement.  This  Agreement  represents  the entire
agreement  between Tenant,  Contractor and Landlord relating to the treatment of
Confidential Information heretofore or hereafter reviewed or inspected by Tenant
or Contractor in connection with the Audit. This Agreement  supersedes all other
agreements  relating to such  matters  which have  previously  been  executed by
Tenant and/or Contractor in favor of Landlord.

         Section  8.  Reliance  by  Landlord's  Management  Company.  Landlord's
property  management  company and its employees  shall be authorized to accept a
copy of this  Agreement  (as executed by Tenant and  Contractor)  as a basis for
allowing Tenant or Contractor to review and inspect the Confidential Information
in connection with the Audit.

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  a duly authorized  representative  for both Tenant
and Contractor have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth below.

ARTICLE 3:  COVENANT OF PURCHASE AND SALE AND INSTRUCTIONS TO ESCROW AGENT

Upon Buyer's exercise of the Option to purchase granted in Article 2 hereof,  in
accordance  with and  subject  to the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,
Seller shall sell and convey the Property to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and
accept the Property from Seller,  for the Purchase Price. In connection with the
administration of Escrow and Closing,  Buyer and Seller hereby agree, and advise
and instruct Escrow Agent, as follows:

         3.1      Payment of Purchase Price.

                  3.1.1 Deposit.

                           3.1.1.1 Deposit Amount and Payment. Concurrently with
                  delivery  of the  Exercise  Notice,  Buyer  shall  deliver the
                  Deposit  into  Escrow.  For  purposes of this  Agreement,  the
                  "Deposit" shall be that amount equal to the difference between
                  the  Down  Payment  and  the  Option  Price,  or  the  sum  of
                  $5,785,000.00 (Five Million Seven Hundred Eighty Five Thousand
                  Dollars).

                           3.1.1.2  Investment  of Deposit.  The Deposit,  while
                  held  in  Escrow,  shall  be  held by the  Escrow  Agent  in a
                  federally-insured,  interest-bearing  account  with a national
                  banking association.  All interest earned on the Deposit while
                  in Escrow shall be added to, and become part of, the Deposit.

                           3.1.1.3  Application of Deposit.  If Buyer, in breach
                  of its obligations under this Agreement, fails to purchase the
                  Property,  Seller upon  termination of this Agreement shall be
                  entitled to retain the Deposit as liquidated  damages (and not
                  as a penalty),  as provided in Section 4.7 (with which  Escrow
                  Agent need not  otherwise be  concerned  after its delivery of
                  the Deposit to  Seller).  At  Closing,  the  Deposit  shall be
                  applied against the Down Payment.

                           3.1.1.4 EINs. For Escrow Agent's information, Buyer's
                  Employer  Identification  Number is  94-3188774  and  Seller's
                  Employer Identification Number is 94-2838567.

                  3.1.2 Down Payment and Other Funds  Required for Closing.  Not
         later than five (5) Business  Days after the Option  Date,  Buyer shall
         deposit in Escrow  current funds in an amount equal to Buyer's share of
         Closing costs under Section 3.4, plus or minus (as the case may be) the
         net amount of prorations and other credits under Section 3.3.

         Note and Deed of Trust for the balance of the Purchase Price.  The Note
         shall  bear  interest  at the rate of  seven  percent  (7%) per  annum.

         interest due on June 20, 2001.  Buyer shall have no right to prepay the

         3.5.2.

                  4.3.4 Accuracy of Warranties and Representations. The accuracy
         in all material respects,  as of Closing, of each of the warranties and
         representations of Buyer set forth in Section 4.1.2.

If any such condition is not timely  satisfied (or waived by Seller in writing),
Seller  shall  have the right to  terminate  this  Agreement  before  Closing by
written  notice of such  termination to Buyer and Escrow Agent given at any time
prior to the  satisfaction of such condition;  but once Closing has occurred all
of the foregoing  conditions,  to the extent not satisfied at Closing,  shall be
deemed to have been irrevocably waived.

                  4.4.1 Buyer's  Activities  on the  Property.  Buyer shall hold
         harmless, indemnify and defend FFLP and Seller from and against any and
         all  claims,   liability  and  losses,  and  expenses  related  thereto
         (including  reasonable attorneys' fees), which FFLP or Seller incurs by
         reason of any damage to the  Property  caused  by, or any  third-person
         claim  against FFLP or Seller  arising or asserted to arise out of, any
         activity of Buyer, or any of Buyer's agents,  conducted on the Property
         prior to Closing. Buyer shall, with reasonable  promptness,  repair any
         damage caused to the Property by any such activity.

         under,  this Section 4.4 shall survive  Closing or  termination of this

         4.5      Damage, Destruction or Condemnation.

                  4.5.1 Termination  Rights. If, prior to Closing,  the Property
         suffers any material damage, destruction or taking by eminent domain (a
         "Casualty"),  Buyer shall have the right, at its election, to terminate
         this Agreement, by written notice given to the Seller prior to the Last
         Closing Date. If a Casualty  occurs fewer than ten Business Days before
         the  Last  Closing  Date,  Seller  shall  have  the  right  in its sole
         discretion to extend the Last Closing Date until the tenth Business Day
         after the  occurrence  of such  Casualty in order for Buyer to make the
         election permitted by this Section.

                  4.5.2 If No  Termination.  In the event that a Casualty occurs
         and Buyer either does not have or does not elect to exercise a right to
         terminate this  Agreement,  this Agreement shall continue in force and,
         upon  Closing,  Buyer  shall be  entitled  to all  insurance  proceeds,
         condemnation  awards  or other  amounts  which  have  been  paid or may
         thereafter  be payable  to FFLP or Seller by any  person in  connection
         with such Casualty  ("Proceeds"),  and at Closing Seller shall pay over
         to Buyer the amount of any Proceeds  already received by FFLP or Seller
         and shall  assign  Buyer all of Seller's  or FFLP's  rights to Proceeds
         which may then be or thereafter become payable.

                  4.5.3 Materiality. For purposes hereof, a material Casualty is
         one in which the extent of the damage,  destruction or taking (measured
         by the cost of repairing or replacing  the damaged,  destroyed or taken
         portion  of the  Property)  exceeds  twenty-five  percent  (25%) of the
         Purchase Price.

         4.6  Assignment by Buyer.  Because Buyer has been selected by Seller to
purchase this Property through a bid process and the identity of the Buyer is of
the utmost  important to Seller,  prior to Closing  Buyer shall have no right to
assign or transfer its rights  under this  Agreement  except with prior  written
consent  of Seller,  which  Seller may in its sole  discretion  deny;  provided,
however,  that Seller will not unreasonably  withhold its consent if Buyer seeks
to assign its rights under this Agreement to a corporation or partnership  which
is at least fifty  percent (50%) owned by Buyer.  Sale of shares or  partnership
interests  or  other  ownership  units  in  Buyer  (other  than on a  nationally
recognized  stock  exchange or  over-the-counter  market)  shall  constitute  an
assignment subject to the terms of this Section. Seller shall have no obligation
to respect any  assignment  in violation of this Section and such an  assignment
shall  constitute a material  breach of this Agreement on the part of Buyer.  No
assignment  shall  relieve  or excuse  Buyer of its  obligations  and  liability
hereunder. Seller's consent to any one assignment shall not be deemed consent to
any other assignment or a waiver of the requirement for its consent to any other
assignment.

         4.7      Rights of Parties Upon Default.

                  4.7.1  Seller's  Rights.  IF CLOSING FAILS TO OCCUR UNDER THIS
         AGREEMENT  DUE TO A  DEFAULT  ON THE  PART OF  BUYER,  SELLER  SHALL BE
         ENTITLED,  AS ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE  REMEDY ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH FAILURE
         AND IN  CONSIDERATION OF ITS WITHDRAWAL OF THE

         TO LIMIT  ITS  POTENTIAL  LIABILITY  TO  SELLER  IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A
         BREACH.  THE FOREGOING  SHALL NOT,  HOWEVER,  LIMIT SELLER'S RIGHTS AND

         4.4.1, and 4.13 (INCLUDING  COSTS OF ENFORCING THIS LIQUIDATED  DAMAGES
         PROVISION) OR, IF CLOSING OCCURS,  TO ENFORCE ANY OTHER  OBLIGATIONS OF
         BUYER HEREUNDER.

         AGREEMENT  DUE TO A  DEFAULT  ON THE  PART OF  SELLER,  BUYER  SHALL BE

         THE DEPOSIT AND ANY OTHER FUNDS  DEPOSITED  BY BUYER INTO  ESCROW;  AND

         CLOSE THE PURCHASE AND SALE HEREUNDER, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES IN THE AMOUNT
         OF $1,000,000;  AND BUYER SPECIFICALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SPECIFICALLY TO

         BUYER AND SELLER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SUCH THE SPECIFIED LIQUIDATED DAMAGES
         ARE NOT BY WAY OF A PENALTY AND ARE  REASONABLE  IN AMOUNT  CONSIDERING
         ALL OF THE  CIRCUMSTANCES

         ESTIMATION  OF THE  POSSIBLE  RANGE OF DAMAGES TO BUYER IN THE EVENT OF
         SUCH A BREACH, THE DIFFICULTY AND  IMPRACTICABILITY  OF ASCERTAINING OR
         PROVING WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES AND THE
         DESIRE OF SELLER TO LIMIT ITS POTENTIAL LIABILITY TO BUYER IN THE EVENT
         OF SUCH A BREACH.  THE  FOREGOING  SHALL NOT,  HOWEVER,  LIMIT  BUYER'S

         4.8      Termination.

                  4.8.1 By Buyer.  If Buyer has and timely  exercises  any right
         hereunder  to  terminate  this  Agreement,  Buyer shall be  immediately
         entitled  to the return of the  Deposit  and all  undisbursed  interest
         earned thereon while in Escrow and,  promptly upon receiving  notice of
         such  termination,  Seller shall join with Buyer in a written notice to
         Escrow  Agent  acknowledging  the  termination  of this  Agreement  and
         instructing  Escrow  Agent to return the Deposit to Buyer and to return
         every other item  deposited in Escrow to the Party which  deposited the
         same.  In  addition,  Seller  shall  promptly  repay the  Option  Price
         (without interest) to Buyer.

                  4.8.2  By  Seller.  If  Seller  has and  exercises  any  right
         hereunder  to  terminate  this  Agreement  for a breach by Buyer of its
         obligations,  warranties or  representations  hereunder,  promptly upon
         receiving notice of such termination  Buyer shall join with Seller in a
         written notice to Escrow Agent  acknowledging  the  termination of this
         Agreement and  instructing  the Title Company to deliver the Deposit to
         Seller and to return all other funds and every other item  deposited in
         Escrow to the Party which deposited the same. If Seller terminates this
         Agreement for any other reason, including without limitation,  pursuant
         to the provisions of Sections 2.4.2, 4.3 (except as a result of Buyer's
         breach),  and  4.5.1,  Seller  shall  promptly,  upon  Buyer's  written
         request,   join  with  Buyer  in  a  written  notice  to  Escrow  Agent
         acknowledging the termination of this Agreement and instructing  Escrow
         Agent to return  the  Deposit to Buyer and to return  every  other item

         activities  of  Buyer  or its  agents  upon  the  Property),  (ii)  any
         liability  which either Party may have  hereunder by reason of the fact
         that  such  termination  either  (A) was  wrongfully  made by it or (B)
         resulted  from  a  breach  of  its   warranties,   covenants  or  other
         obligations hereunder, and (iii) any obligation under Section 4.13.

         4.9 Brokerage Commission. Upon Closing, Seller shall pay any commission
due to Broker,  in connection  with the sale and purchase of the Property as set
forth in this Agreement,  under a separate, written agreement between Seller and
Broker.  Nothing  contained  herein shall be deemed to make Broker a third-party
beneficiary  of this Agreement or to create any obligation on the part of either
Party to close the sale and purchase of the Property for Broker's benefit.  Each
Party shall hold  harmless,  indemnify and defend the other from and against any
claim or  liability  for a  commission,  fee or other  compensation  to  broker,
salesman,  finder or  similar  intermediary,  and for any  expenses  (including,
without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees and expenses)  related to the
defense of any such claim,  which  results  constitute  a breach of such Party's
representation, contained in Section 4.1.1(vii) or Section 4.1.2(iv).

         4.10  Post-Closing  Prorations  and  Adjustments.  After  Closing,  the
Parties shall make the following additional prorations and settlements:

                  4.10.1  Real  Estate   Taxes  and   Assessments.   If  Closing
         prorations of real estate taxes and assessments are based on other than
         the current  year's tax bill,  within 30 days after such bill is issued
         to Buyer,  Buyer shall recompute such proration.  If such recomputation
         results in a larger proration credit to Seller,  Buyer shall pay Seller
         the  additional  amount  due  Seller  within  such  30  days.  If  such
         recomputation  results in a larger  proration  credit to Buyer,  Seller
         shall pay Buyer the  additional  amount due Buyer  within 30 days after
         receiving Buyer's written recomputation of such proration,  accompanied
         by a copy of such tax bill.

                  4.10.2   Determinations   of   Post-Closing   Prorations   and
         Adjustments.  Except where expressly  provided  otherwise,  Buyer shall
         make the required  determinations  and computations of all post-Closing
         prorations  and  other   adjustments   under  this  Section  4.10  (the
         "Post-Closing  Prorations")  and shall provide Seller with a reasonably
         detailed written summary of each Post-Closing  Proration,  concurrently
         with or prior to making any payment to or  requesting  any payment from
         Seller under this Section 4.10 with respect thereto.  Seller shall have
         the right to audit all of Buyer's  books and records  pertaining to the
         Post-Closing  Prorations.  For this purpose, Buyer shall allow Seller's
         designated  representatives  access to such books and  records,  at the
         Property  or  Buyer's  principal  place of  business  within the United
         States, at any time during normal business hours, and Seller shall have
         the right to make  copies of such books and  records  (and the right to
         use Buyer's  photocopying  equipment to make such copies,  paying Buyer
         its actual  out-of-pocket cost for such copying).  Except to the extent
         that Seller,  before the second  anniversary of the Closing Date, gives
         Buyer written  notice of objections  to Buyer's  determinations  of the
         Post-Closing  Prorations,  Buyer's  determinations  and computations of
         such  prorations and adjustments  shall be conclusive,  if made in good
         faith and with full  disclosure  to Seller.  If Seller  does give Buyer
         timely  written  notice of  objection to Buyer's  determination  of any
         Post-Closing  Proration  and the  Parties  are unable to  resolve  such
         objection by mutual agreement  within 30 days thereafter,  either Party
         shall have the right to submit such dispute to binding  arbitration by,
         and  under  the   applicable   rules  of,  the   American   Arbitration
         Association,  in San Mateo or San Francisco counties,  California.  The
         arbitrator  in  such  arbitration   shall,  to  the  extent  reasonably
         necessary to



                                      -24-

         the enforcement of Seller's rights  hereunder,  order the production to
         Seller of any or all of Buyer's  books and  records  pertaining  to the
         Post-Closing  Prorations.  The arbitrator shall endeavor to resolve any
         such submitted  dispute and render a written award within 90 days after
         the arbitrator's appointment.

         4.11 Design Review.  The Property is subject to the Shores CC&Rs, which
provides for design review of any proposed  improvements  to be  constructed  by
Buyer.  Pursuant to the Shores CC&Rs,  the Shores  Business  Center  Association
Architectural  Review Committee ("Shores Review Committee") has been formed, and
said  Review  Committee  has  promulgated  Guidelines.  Buyer  acknowledges  its
receipt,  review and  acceptance  of the Shores  CC&Rs and the  Guidelines,  and
agrees  that it shall,  at all  times,  comply  with said  Shores  CC&Rs and the
Guidelines and any existing or future supplements or amendments  thereto.  Buyer
agrees that it shall inform itself of the procedures of the Review Committee and
shall comply with such procedures, including, without limitation, lead times for
the submission of plans and documents to be reviewed.

         4.12 Buyer's  Covenants  and  Agreements.  Buyer hereby  covenants  and
agrees with Seller as follows:

                  4.12.1  Agreement for  Covenants  Running With the Land. On or
         before  Closing,  Buyer and FFLP shall execute in  recordable  form and
         deliver into Escrow, for recording at Closing,  that certain "Covenants
         Agreement"  in the form attached  hereto as Exhibit G. At Closing,  the
         Covenants Agreement shall be recorded against the Property  immediately

         instruments or conveyances.

         copy of the  Development  Agreement.  Buyer further  acknowledges it is
         aware of the terms  thereof,  including in  particular,  the  following
         provisions:

         Buyer further



                                      -26-

         acknowledges that the costs of extending  utilities to the Property may
         exceed the utility company's free extension allowance, if any, and that
         Buyer  shall be solely  responsible  for all such  costs.  The  parties
         acknowledge that Buyer has further improvement  obligations relative to
         the  Property,  as such  obligations  are set  forth  in the  Covenants
         Agreement.

                  4.12.4 Facility  Charges,  School Facilities Fees and Proposed
         Impact Fees. Buyer acknowledges (i) that FFLP and the City have entered
         into a Development  Agreement  which during its term sets the amount of
         facilities  fees and other  exactions  which may be charged by the City
         for the issuance of building  permits for the  Property;  (ii) that the
         City has  adopted an  ordinance  and  recorded an  agreement  requiring
         property  owners to pay a  facilities  fee as a condition  precedent to
         receiving a building  permit,  and that said  ordinance  and  agreement
         applies to the Property;  (iii) that an application fee may be required
         by the Architectural  Review Committees described in Section 4.11; (iv)
         that a fire  service fee and  participation  in the cost of a reclaimed
         water system  program may be imposed upon Buyer and the Property by the
         City; (v) that the Belmont  School  District and the Sequoia Union High
         School  District  have adopted a requirement  that the property  owners
         within  said  districts  pay a  school  facilities  fee as a  condition
         precedent to receiving a building permit (the "School Facilities Fees")
         and that  said  requirement  applies  to the  Property;  (vi)  that the
         Sequoia  Union  High  School  District  has  formed a  landscaping  and
         lighting  maintenance  assessment  district,  and that such  assessment
         district includes the Property;  and (vii) that a  multi-jurisdictional
         traffic  assessment  district for improvements to Highway 101 and other
         area-wide   traffic   improvements  has  been  proposed  and  is  being
         considered  by the City and other  nearby  cities  (including,  without
         limitation,  the City of Belmont and the City of San Carlos), that such
         assessment  district  would include the Property and that in Section 12
         of the Development Agreement, FFLP has waived objection, subject to the
         limitations in Section 12 of the  Development  Agreement,  on behalf of
         itself,  its successors and assigns,  including Buyer, to the formation
         thereof.  Buyer  acknowledges and agrees that Buyer, and neither Seller
         nor FFLP,  shall be solely  responsible  for the  payment of the City's
         facilities  fee and  the  School  Facilities  Fees  and  for all  other
         charges,  taxes,  fees or costs,  of any nature  whatsoever,  which are
         imposed  or  incurred  after  Closing  and which are  related  (whether
         directly or  indirectly) to the  development of the Property,  it being
         specifically agreed that neither Seller nor FFLP has and shall not have
         any  responsibility  or liability of any nature  whatsoever  to pay, or
         contribute to the payment of, any of the fees, costs,  taxes or charges
         contemplated  in this  Agreement and imposed or incurred from and after
         the  Closing.  Buyer  acknowledges  that  pursuant  to the  Development
         Agreement,  Seller or FFLP may be required to prepay certain facilities
         fees to the City which could be credited  against  facilities  fees and
         exactions   Buyer  would   otherwise   be  required  to  pay.  If  such
         circumstance occurs,  Buyer shall,  simultaneously with Buyer's payment
         of facilities  fees and other exactions to the City,  reimburse  Seller
         the full amount of any such credit Buyer  receives.  The  provisions of
         this  Section  4.12.4 are solely for the  benefit of Seller,  Buyer and
         FFLP and not for the benefit of any other person or entity  (including,
         without  limitation,  the Belmont School District and the Sequoia Union
         High  School  District),  and no party  other than FFLP and Seller (and
         Seller's  successors  and  assigns)  shall be  entitled  to rely on the
         provisions of this section or receive any benefit  therefrom or enforce
         against Buyer any of the provisions of this section.

                  4.12.5 Surplus Earth Material.  Buyer  acknowledges  that FFLP
         has  granted  RSP,  its   successors   and  assigns  an  exclusive  and
         irrevocable option to acquire surplus earth material generated from the
         development of the Property and that FFLP and RSP executed and recorded
         a Memorandum  thereof.  The terms,  provisions,  and  conditions of the
         option,  as set forth in  Section  11.8 of that  certain  Agreement  of
         Purchase and Sale by and between RSP and FFLP  predecessor  in interest

         Commission  has been  presented with and is considering an amendment to
         the San  Mateo  County  Airport  Land Use Plan  which  would,  in part,
         require  local land owners within the Redwood  Shores  Project to grant
         avigation  easements  to  the  County.  Buyer  acknowledges  that  such
         proximity to the San Carlos Airport, and any proposed amendments to the
         San Mateo County  Airport Land Use Plan may have an impact or effect on
         the  Property  or  Buyer's  use of  the  Property,  including,  without
         limitation,  (a) the production of noise,  odors,  pollution,  traffic,
         glare and/or other impacts,  and (b) requiring that  development of the
         Property be  conditioned  on the granting of an  avigation  easement(s)
         and/or other restrictions (collectively,  the "Airport Matters"). Buyer
         expressly   acknowledges   and  agrees  that   Seller   shall  have  no
         responsibility for any costs,  expenses,  liabilities or obligations of
         any kind or nature  whatsoever  arising out of or in any way related to
         the Airport Matters.

         respect to the improvements to be constructed on the Property:

<PAGE>

                                    (a)  The  Maximum  Square  Footage  of  GBFA
         assumes  that Buyer  secures  adequate  sewer  capacity  to permit such
         construction.  Seller  has  advised  Buyer  that FFLP has  received  an
         assignment from RSP of allocation of sewage treatment capacity with the
         South Bayside System  Authority  sufficient to permit FFLP to construct
         up to 885,000 square feet of GBFA in the Park, which has been confirmed
         in that certain Second Amendment to Development  Agreement dated August
         31, 1998,  by and between the City and FFLP (the  "Second  Amendment").
         Furthermore,  the  City,  pursuant  to the  Development  Agreement,  as
         amended by the Second Amendment,  has agreed to sell to FFLP additional
         sanitary sewage treatment capacity up to 25,000 gallons per day ("gpd")
         at  $2.50  per  gpd,  as  needed  to  permit  construction  of the full
         1,000,000  square feet of GBFA  authorized for office space in the Park
         by the Development  Agreement.  At Closing,  Seller shall cause FFLP to
         assign  to Buyer,  by an  Assignment  in the form of  Exhibit I hereto,
         sufficient sewage treatment  capacity from its rights received from RSP
         to construct an aggregate 340,000 square feet of GBFA in Zones 2 and 4.
         Buyer  acknowledges that the foregoing  assignments are the entirety of
         what Seller can and will offer to Buyer for sewage  treatment  capacity
         and Seller has no further or greater obligation to Buyer. If additional
         sewage  treatment  capacity  is still  required,  Buyer must  purchase,
         lease, or otherwise acquire such capacity on the open market at Buyer's
         sole expense.

                                    (b)  The   Maximum   Height   of   Permitted
         Structures  is  calculated  as the height to the  highest  point of the
         building and all superstructures above mean sea level.

                  4.12.8 No Construction  Area. Buyer, on behalf of itself,  its
         successors and assigns, covenants that it shall not construct, nor seek
         or accept any  authorization  to  construct,  any  structure or portion
         thereof (excluding landscaping,  surface roadways and parking,  awnings
         or other protrusions over entrance  doorways,  covered walkways,  patio
         facilities,  related  outbuildings  not to exceed  fifteen (15) feet in
         height,  and related  installations  such as light  standards) in those
         portions  of  Zone  2  described  in  Exhibit  N  attached  hereto  and
         incorporated  herein.  Buyer shall  execute and record at Closing  such
         documents  as Seller  shall  reasonably  request  to  memorialize  this
         obligation of record.

         4.13.  Enforcement  Costs.  Should either Party institute any action or
proceeding to enforce any  provision of this  Agreement or for damages by reason
of an alleged breach of any provision hereof (including,  without limitation, an
arbitration  proceeding  under  Section  4.10),  the  prevailing  Party shall be
entitled  to receive all costs and  expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys'
fees)  incurred  by such  prevailing  Party in  connection  with such  action or
proceeding.

         A Party entitled to recover costs and expenses under this Section shall
also be  entitled  to  recover  all costs  and  expenses  (including  reasonable
attorneys'  fees)  incurred in the  enforcement  of any  judgment or  settlement
obtained in such action or proceeding  and  provision  (and in any such judgment
provision  shall  be  made  for the  recovery  of such  postjudgment  costs  and
expenses).

                  All of Seller's  rights and remedies will be  cumulative.  The
exercise of any rights of Seller  hereunder  shall not in any way  constitute  a
cure or waiver of a default  hereunder or elsewhere,  or invalidate any act done
pursuant to any notice of default, or prejudice Seller in the exercise of any of
its other rights hereunder or elsewhere  unless, in the exercise of said rights,
Seller realizes all amounts owed to it hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
whether or not Seller  elects to employ any or all of the remedies  available to
it upon a default, Seller shall not be liable for the construction or failure to
construct or complete or protect the  Improvements or for payment of any expense
incurred in  connection  with the exercise of any remedy  available to Seller or
for the construction or completion of the Improvements or for the performance of
any other obligation of Buyer.

FLATIRONS  FUNDING,   LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP,   a  Delaware  limited  partnership,
("FFLP"),  and  __________________________,   a  _______________________________

ELECTRONIC ARTS REDWOOD,  INC., a Delaware  corporation  ("EAR") is a party with
respect to Sections 1.3, 6, and 9 only.

                                    RECITALS

         A. Concurrent with the recording of this Covenants Agreement,  FFLP has

         B.  FFLP is the  owner of four (4)  legal  lots in the City of  Redwood
City, County of San Mateo, California, as more particularly described in Exhibit

         C. FFLP  acquired the  Conveyed  Property,  the  Retained  Property and
certain  other  real   property  in  the  vicinity  of  the  Conveyed   Property
(collectively,  the  "Project") on February

         E. As a material  inducement  and condition to EAR selling the Conveyed
Property to Buyer, and as an integral part of the  negotiations  between EAR and
Buyer as to the purchase  price,  terms and  conditions  of sale of the Conveyed
Property by EAR,  Buyer has agreed to execute this  Covenants  Agreement  (i) to
assume FFLP's duties and obligations with respect to the Conveyed Property under
the Redwood Shores Covenants Agreement; (ii) to create personal covenants of the
Parties  and their  Successors  (as  defined  in Section 4 below) to and for the
exclusive  benefit of each other and their  Designated  Assigns  (as  defined in
Section 4 below) and (iii) to also create covenants  running with the land under
California Civil Code Section 1468 in favor of and benefiting the Properties.

         NOW, THEREFORE,  for good and valuable  consideration,  the receipt and
sufficiency  of which is  hereby  acknowledged  by each of FFLP and  Buyer,  the

respect to the Conveyed Property.  FFLP expressly hereby (i) designates Buyer as
being  entitled  to enforce  all  provisions  of the  Redwood  Shores  Covenants
Agreement insofar as they affect the Conveyed Property in the same manner and to
the same extent as FFLP has heretofore been entitled;  (ii) designates  Buyer as
being  entitled to  participate  in amendments to the Redwood  Shores  Covenants
Agreement insofar as they affect the Conveyed Property in the same manner and to

Covenants Agreement.

                  1.2 Assumption. Buyer, for itself, its successors and assigns,

obligations,  liabilities, and covenants hereby assumed. EAR shall indemnify and
hold Buyer,  its  successors  and assigns,  harmless from any and all liability,
cost, loss, damage, or expense,  including attorney's fees, arising out of EAR's

be amended from time to time (the "Development Agreement"); and that Buyer shall
not develop and construct  more than an aggregate  340,000  square feet of Gross

elevator shafts,  other shafts,  mechanical  rooms,  vents, and internal support

storage  areas  located  on the  roof  to the  extent  such  structures  are not
considered  by the City as  building  floor  area for  purposes  of  determining
parking  requirements,  traffic  generation,  building  density or other similar
development limitations.

                  2.2 FFLP's Covenant Not to Exceed  Density.  FFLP covenants to
Buyer that at all times  during the term of this  covenant  (as such term is set

         3. Benefit and Burden of Covenants  Generally;  Equitable  Enforcement.
Buyer and FFLP acknowledge and agree that the assumptions set forth in Section 1
above and the covenants set forth in Section 2 above relate to the use,  repair,
maintenance, improvement and development of, or payment of taxes and assessments
on, the Project or some part thereof,  and that these  covenants are intended to
both bind Buyer and Buyer's  Successors (as defined in Section 4 hereof) for the
personal benefit of FFLP and FFLP's Designated  Assigns (as defined in Section 4
hereof), or to bind FFLP and FFLP's Successors for the personal benefit of Buyer
and Buyer's Designated  Assigns,  as the case may be, as more fully set forth in
Section 4 below,  and to burden the  Conveyed  Property  for the  benefit of the
Retained  Property,  or to burden the  Retained  Property for the benefit of the
Conveyed  Property,  as the case may be, as more  fully  set forth in  Section 5
below.  Each of Buyer and FFLP  acknowledges and agrees that the assumptions set
forth in Section 1 and the  covenants set forth in Section 2 above and all other
terms and provisions of this Covenants  Agreement have been  negotiated  between
Buyer and FFLP in an arm's length commercial  transaction between sophisticated,
knowledgeable  parties,  each possessing  substantial  experience in real estate
transactions  and  represented  by  independent  counsel;  that  this  Covenants
Agreement  has been an integral  part of  negotiations  concerning  the purchase
price,  terms and conditions of the sale of the Conveyed Property to Buyer; that
the Parties'  execution,  delivery and  recording  of this  Covenants  Agreement
constitutes a material part of their agreement to purchase and sell the Conveyed
Property and that the Parties would not close the sale of the Conveyed  Property
to Buyer  without  the  execution,  delivery  and  recording  of this  Covenants
Agreement;  that each Party has a legitimate  personal  business interest in the
other's  development and  construction of the  Improvements on their  respective
Property in conjunction  with the continued  development and sale of the balance
of the Project;  that the purchase price paid by Buyer for the Conveyed Property
takes into account the  assumption  set forth in Section 1 and the covenants set
forth in Section 2 above (including, without limitation, the density limitations
set forth in  Sections  2.1 and 2.2 and the  covenant  not to build set forth in

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Section  2.4);  and that it is and shall be equitable  for the Parties and their
Designated  Assigns or any  beneficial  owner of the  Property,  in its sole and
absolute  discretion  and without any obligation to do so, to enforce any breach
of  these  covenants  by a  Party  or its  Successors  in  accordance  with  the
provisions of Section 8.3 below,  notwithstanding that the use of the respective
Property unrestricted by said covenants might be more profitable to its owner or
that  enforcement of these  covenants  might  financially  benefit the enforcing
Party or its Designated Assigns.

         4. Covenants as Personal Covenants. Each of Buyer and FFLP acknowledges
and agrees  that each of the  covenants  assumed as set forth in Section 2 above
constitutes a personal  covenant of the  covenanting  Party and its  successors,
assigns,  transferees,   grantees,  devisees,   executors,   administrators  and
representatives   (collectively  "Successors")  (whether  such  Successors  have
succeeded  to the  Party's  interest in the  respective  Property in whole or in
part,  directly,  indirectly  (whether  by merger,  consolidation,  liquidation,
reorganization,  sale of assets or sale of stock of the Party),  by operation of
law or  through  foreclosure,  deed in lieu of  foreclosure,  trustee's  sale or
otherwise),  to and for the sole benefit of (i) the other Party (the  "Benefited
Party") and only such of the Benefited Party's successors, assigns, transferees,
grantees, heirs, devisees, executors, administrators and representatives (x) who
hold an  interest  in real  property  within the  Project  and (y) who have been
expressly  designated by the Benefited Party (in a written designation  document
recorded by the  Benefited  Party  against  the  applicable  Property)  as being
entitled  to  enforce  all or certain  specified  provisions  of this  Covenants
Agreement (collectively, a Party's "Designated Assigns") and (ii) the beneficial
owner(s) of the  Benefited  Party's  Property.  Buyer further  acknowledges  and
agrees  that  the  indemnification  obligation  set  forth  in  Section  1 above
constitutes a personal  covenant of Buyer and Buyer's  Successors  (whether such
Buyer's  Successors have succeeded to Buyer's  interest in the Property in whole
or in part, directly, indirectly (whether by merger, consolidation, liquidation,
reorganization,  sale of assets or sale of stock of Buyer),  by operation of law
or  through  foreclosure,  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure,  trustee's  sale  or
otherwise),  to and for the  sole  benefit  of (i) FFLP  and  FFLP's  Designated
Assigns and  including  EAR and (ii) the  beneficial  owner(s)  of the  Retained
Property.  The indemnity and defense obligations set forth in this Section shall
survive for twenty (20) years after the date of  recordation  of this  Covenants
Agreement  notwithstanding  that a Party may no longer  possess  any  beneficial
ownership  interest in the Property.  Except as expressly set forth above and in
Section 5 below, the covenants set forth in Section 2 above shall not be for the
benefit of or  enforceable  by any other person or entity owning any property in
the  Project.  Neither  FFLP  or  Buyer  or  their  Designated  Assigns  nor the
beneficial  owner(s) of either the Retained  Property or the  Conveyed  Property
shall have any  obligation to enforce any such  covenants for the benefit of any
other person or entity.

         5.  Covenants  Running With the Land.  All covenants  and  restrictions
contained in Section 2 above shall also be  covenants  running with the land for
the benefit of the Retained Property,  or the Conveyed Property, as the case may
be, and shall, in any event, and without regard to technical  classification  or
designation,  legal or otherwise,  be to the fullest extent permitted by law and
equity,  binding  for the  benefit  of and in favor of, and  enforceable  by any
person (including, without limitation, the Parties and their Designated Assigns)
having  any



                                      -5-
<PAGE>

beneficial  ownership in the Retained Property or the Conveyed Property,  as the
case may be. Buyer and FFLP  acknowledge and agree that given the close vicinity
of the  Conveyed  Property  and the  Retained  Property,  that the  development,
construction and operation of the Improvements on the Properties pursuant to the
covenants in Section 2 above shall  directly  benefit  each Party's  Property by
enhancing the value of each Party's Property.

         6. Term.  The  Assumption  and  Indemnification  set forth in Section 1
shall be of the same duration as that of the Redwood Shores Covenants Agreement.
The covenants set forth in Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.4 above shall  automatically
terminate  and become  null and void on the date  twenty  (20)  years  after the
recordation date of this Covenants Agreement. The covenants set forth in Section
2.3 above shall be of the same duration as that of the Park Declaration.

         7. Priority of Mortgage  Lien. No violation or breach of the covenants,
conditions, restrictions,  provisions or limitations contained in this Covenants
Agreement shall defeat or render invalid or in any way impair the lien or charge
of any mortgage or deed of trust or security  interest  recorded  against either
the Conveyed  Property or the Retained  Property;  provided,  however,  that any
subsequent owner of the Conveyed Property or Retained Property,  as the case may
be,  or  portion  thereof  shall  constitute  a  Successor  and be bound by such
remaining  covenants,  conditions,  restrictions,  limitations,  and provisions,
whether  such  owner's  title  was  acquired  by  foreclosure,  deed  in lieu of
foreclosure, trustee's sale or otherwise.

         8.       Defaults: No Waiver of Rights; Remedies.

                  8.1  Defaults.  If a Party should  breach any of the covenants
set  forth  herein  or  default  in the  performance  of any of its  obligations
hereunder,  then the other  Party,  its  Designated  Assigns  or the  beneficial
owner(s) of a Property  shall have the immediate  and absolute  right to enforce
any or all of the remedies set forth in Section 8.3 below  without the necessity
of providing the breaching  Party with any notice of the default or  opportunity
to cure the default.

                  8.2  No  Waiver  of  Rights.  Any  failures  or  delays  by  a
non-breaching  Party or its Designated  Assigns or the beneficial  owner(s) of a
Property to provide any default notices to a breaching Party or to assert any of
their rights and remedies as to any breach or default by a breaching Party under
this  Covenants  Agreement  shall  not  deprive  them of  their  right  to later
institute and maintain any actions or proceedings  which they or any one of them
may deem  necessary  to protect,  assert or enforce any such rights or remedies.
Each Party  acknowledges  and agrees that the other Party  reserves the right to
determine whether or not and when, if at all, it will seek to enforce any of its
rights and  remedies  with  respect to a breach of any of the  covenants in this
Covenants  Agreement  and that any delay of or  reservation  in  enforcing  such
rights and  remedies  shall not  constitute  a waiver or  relinquishment  of any
future  enforcement  of this  Covenants  Agreement by a Party or its  Designated
Assigns or the beneficial owner(s) of a Property.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

                  8.3  Remedies.   A  Party,  its  Designated   Assigns  or  the
beneficial owner(s) of a Property may institute any legal or equitable action to
cure,  correct, or remedy any default, to recover damages for any default, or to
obtain  any  other  remedy  consistent  with  the  purposes  of  this  Covenants
Agreement, including, without limitation, specific performance and/or injunctive
relief (both mandatory and  prohibitory),  abatement  proceedings,  constructive
trust or  equitable  liens.  The  rights  and  remedies  of the  Parties,  their
Designated Assigns and/or the beneficial owner of a Property are cumulative, and
the exercise by the Parties, their Designated Assigns or the beneficial owner of
a Property  of one or more of such  rights or remedies  shall not  preclude  the
exercise by it, at the same or different  times, of any other rights or remedies
for the same default or any other default.

         9.       General Provisions.

                  9.1  Attorneys'  Fees. In the event of litigation  between the

such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.

kept or  observed  by Buyer or FFLP in  respect  to said  Conveyed  Property  or

                                     FORM OF
                     ASSIGNMENT OF SEWAGE TREATMENT CAPACITY



                  THIS ASSIGNMENT  ("Assignment") is made and entered into as of
___________________,   1999,   by  and  between   FLATIRONS   FUNDING,   LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP, ("Assignor"), and _____________________________________________,  a
__________________ ("Assignee").

                                    RECITALS

                  A.  Electronic  Arts Redwood,  Inc.  ("EAR") and Assignee,  as
successor-in-interest,  are parties to that  certain  Agreement  of Purchase and
Sale dated ______________ (the "Purchase  Agreement") whereby EAR agreed to sell
to Assignee, and Assignee agreed to purchase from EAR, certain real property (as
more  particularly  described  in Exhibit "A" of the  Purchase  Agreement)  (the
"Property"),  all in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions of the Purchase
Agreement.

                  B.  Pursuant to the  Purchase  Agreement,  EAR agreed to cause
Assignor to assign to  Assignee,  at the closing  under the  Purchase  Agreement
("Closing"),  a sufficient  allocation of sewage treatment capacity from sources
available  to Assignor to permit  Assignee to  construct  up to an  aggregate of
Three Hundred Forty Thousand  (340,000) square feet of Gross Building Floor Area
on Zones 2 and 4 ("Maximum  Square  Footage") (but no more) on the Property.  As
used in this  Assignment,  the term "Gross  Building Floor Area" or "GBFA" means
the sum total of all floor  areas  contained  within the  exterior  walls of all
Buildings  including,  without  limitation,  stairways,  elevator shafts,  other
shafts, mechanical rooms, vents, and internal support facilities,  but excluding
those portions of mechanical or utility  structures and storage areas located on
the  roof to the  extent  such  structures  are not  considered  by the  City as
building floor area for purposes of determining  parking  requirements,  traffic
generation, building density or other similar development limitations.

                  C. Assignor holds certain rights to sewage treatment  capacity
applicable  to the Property and other lands owned by Assignor  consisting of (a)
rights to sufficient sewage treatment  capacity to construct 885,000 square feet
of GBFA for office use derived by mesne  assignments from a grant by the City of
Redwood City (the "City") to Mobil Oil Estates  (Redwood)  Limited  dated May 1,
1978 (the "Mobil Rights") which the City and Assignor  confirmed in that certain
Second  Amendment to  Development  Agreement  dated  August 31,  1998,  ("Second
Amendment") and (b) rights to purchase additional sewage treatment capacity from
the City up to 25,000  gallons per day ("gpd"),  as needed,  at $2.50 per gpd as
confirmed  in and  pursuant to the Second  Amendment  (the  "Purchase  Rights").
Assignor intends to assign to



                                      -1-
<PAGE>

Assignee  sufficient  sewage treatment  capacity from the Mobil Rights to enable
Assignee to construct the Maximum Square Footage.

                  NOW,  THEREFORE,  for good  and  valuable  consideration,  the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,  Assignor and Assignee
hereby agree as follows:

                  1.  Assignment.   Assignor  hereby  assigns  to  Assignee  the
following rights to sewage treatment capacity (the "Sewage Capacity Rights"):

                           (a)  Assignor  assigns  to  Assignee  from its  Mobil
Rights  sufficient  sewage  treatment  capacity  with the South  Bayside  System
Authority  ("SBSA") to permit  construction  of 340,000  square feet of GBFA for
office use.

                           (b) If for any  reason  the  foregoing  grant  is not
sufficient to permit Assignee to construct the Maximum Square Footage,  Assignee
must purchase,  lease, or otherwise acquire any needed sewage treatment capacity
on the open market.  Neither City,  EAR, nor Assignor is in any way obligated to
provide Assignee with sewage treatment  capacity except as set forth herein, and
in particular, neither EAR nor Assignor has any obligation to assign to Assignee
any of the Purchase Rights. City has agreed in the Development  Agreement to use
its best efforts to assist Assignor in obtaining any additional  capacity deemed
necessary, and Assignor, to the extent such agreement of the City is assignable,
hereby assigns to Assignee such agreement of the City to use best efforts.

                           (c)  Assignee   acknowledges   and  agrees  that  the
foregoing  assignment of Sewage Capacity Rights specifically  excludes any right
by  Assignee  to sell,  assign,  convey or  otherwise  transfer in any way (and,
therefore,   Assignee  is  specifically  prohibited  from  selling,   assigning,
conveying or otherwise  transferring  in any way) such Sewage Capacity Rights to
any third party for any use outside the  Property.  Any Sewage  Capacity  Rights
assigned hereunder but not actually required by Assignee for the construction of
the  Maximum  Square  Footage  shall  revert  to  Assignor.   Assignee   further
acknowledges  and agrees that,  other than the limited  assignment of the Sewage
Capacity Rights hereunder, Assignor is not assigning,  conveying or transferring
to  Assignee  any other  right,  title or  interest  of  Assignor  of any nature
whatsoever.

                  2.  Representations  and Warranties.  Assignor  represents and
warrants that it holds  sufficient  Sewage  Capacity Rights to enable it to make
this  Assignment  and  that it has due  power  and  authorization  to make  this
Assignment.

                  3. No Further Obligations. Neither Assignor nor EAR shall have
any  obligation  or liability  whatsoever  with  respect to the Sewage  Capacity
Rights, including,  without limitation, any obligation to obtain the City's, the
SBSA's or any other  governmental or other entity's  approval or consent to this
Assignment, or to incur any costs, expenses or other liabilities or pay any fees
(whether  directly or  indirectly),  dedicate  any land,  provide any parking or
reduce the  density  on, or the  allotment  of sewage  treatment  capacity  with
respect to, any other  property owned by Assignor or EAR, or in any other manner
adversely  affect  Assignor or EAR or any  property  owned by Assignor or EAR or
take any action  whatsoever  with  respect to the Sewage


                                      -2-
<PAGE>

Capacity Rights or in pursuit of any development rights or approvals whatsoever.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  Assignor  shall  cooperate  with  and  provide
Assignee all  reasonable  assistance in perfecting  Assignee's  Sewage  Capacity
Rights hereunder.

                  4.  Attorneys'  Fees. In the event of  litigation  between the
parties  with  respect  to this  Assignment,  the  prevailing  party  (by way of
settlement,  dismissal or final  judgment)  shall be entitled to its  reasonable
costs and  expenses  incurred in  connection  with such  litigation,  including,
without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees. For purposes of this provision,
"prevailing  party" shall  include a party which  dismisses  such  litigation in
exchange  for  payment  of the  sum  allegedly  due,  performance  of  covenants
allegedly breached, or consideration substantially equal to the relief sought in
the litigation.

                  5. Certain Obligations  Non-Recourse.  Assignor's  obligations
hereunder are intended to be the  obligations of the limited  partnership and of
the  corporations  which are the managing  general partner and any other general
partner  thereof  only,  and no recourse for the payment of any amount due under
this  Agreement or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect  thereof,
shall be held  against  any limited  partner of  Assignor  or any  incorporator,
shareholder, officer, director or affiliate, as such, past, present or future of
such  corporate  managing  general  partner or other  general  partner or of any
corporate  limited  partner or of any successor  corporation  to such  corporate
managing  general  partner or other  general  partner or any  corporate  limited
partner of Assignor,  or against any direct or indirect  parent  corporation  of
such  corporate  managing  general  partner or other  general  partner or of any
limited  partner of Assignor or any other  subsidiary  or  affiliate of any such
direct or indirect parent corporation or any incorporator,  shareholder  officer
or  director,  as such,  past,  present or future,  of any such  parent or other
subsidiary  or  affiliate,  it  being  understood  that  Assignor  is a  limited
partnership  formed for the purpose of  acquiring  and owning the  Property  and
acting as lessor to Electronic Arts Redwood,  Inc., on the express understanding
aforesaid.  Nothing  contained in this Section 6 shall be construed to limit the
exercise or enforcement,  in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and any
other documents  referred to herein,  of rights and remedies against the limited
partnership  or the  corporate  managing  general  partner or any other  general
partner of Assignor or the assets of the limited  partnership  or the  corporate
managing  general partner or any other general  partner of Assignor.  As used in
this Section 6, "affiliate" means any other person controlling, controlled by or
under direct or indirect  common  control with such person;  "person"  means any
individual, corporation, partnership, limited liability company, private limited
company, joint venture,  association joint-stock company, trust,  unincorporated
association, organ of government or any agency or political subdivision thereof;
and "control,"  when used with any specified  person,  means the power to direct
the  management  and policies of such person,  directly or  indirectly,  whether
through the ownership of voting  securities,  by contract or otherwise;  and the
terms "controlling" and "controlled" have meanings correlative to the foregoing.

                  6.  Governing  Law. This  Assignment  shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of the foregoing,  and of the mutual
covenants and conditions  herein contained,  the parties hereto  (together,  the
"Parties," and each sometimes a "Party") hereby act and agree as follows:

Assignee,  and  Assignee  hereby  takes and accepts  from  Assignor,  (A) all of
Assignor's  rights in, under and to the  Development  Agreement as it applies to
the Property and to all benefits and privileges  hereafter  accruing to Assignor
thereunder,  including without limitation Assignee's right to build an aggregate

         2.  Assumption of Obligations  and  Liabilities  by Assignee.  Assignee
hereby  expressly  and  unconditionally  assumes  all  of  the  obligations  and
liabilities  of Assignor  under the  Development  Agreement as it applies to the
Property  accruing  from and  after the date  hereof.  Assignee  covenants  that
Assignee  shall at all  times  fully  comply  with,  and  that the  development,

warranty,  representation,  covenant  or  indemnification  made in the  Purchase
Agreement  by either  Party,  or to waive or  abrogate  any limits on  liability
specified in the Purchase Agreement, and none of such provisions in the Purchase
Agreement  shall be  deemed  to have  merged  into the  assignment  made by this
Assignment. To the extent any rights granted under the Development Agreement may
be limited or restricted  by terms of the Purchase  Agreement or of that certain
Assumption and Covenants  Agreement  dated as of August 31, 1998, by and between
Assignor  and  Assignee  ("Covenants  Agreement"),  the  terms  of the  Purchase

of  default  specified  in the  Purchase  Agreement,  the Deed of Trust,  or the
Guaranty, Holder shall have the option of declaring the principal balance hereof

price for the Property.

insurance through blanket policies carried by Trustor and covering more than one
location,  or by  policies  procured by a tenant or other  party  holding  under
Trustor; provided, however, all such policies shall be in form and substance and
issued by companies satisfactory to Beneficiary. At least thirty (30) days prior
to the expiration of each required policy,  Trustor shall deliver to Beneficiary
evidence  satisfactory  to Beneficiary of the payment of premium and the renewal
or replacement of such policy  continuing  insurance in form as required by this
Deed of Trust. All such policies shall contain a provision that, notwithstanding
any contrary agreement between Trustor and the insurance company,  such policies
will  not  be  canceled,  allowed  to  lapse  without  renewal,  surrendered  or
materially  amended  (which  term shall  include any  reduction  in the scope or
limits of coverage)  without at least thirty (30) days' prior written  notice to
Beneficiary.  All consents and approvals of Beneficiary required by this Section
1.04 shall be given or withheld in the reasonable discretion of Beneficiary.  If
Trustor fails to provide,  maintain, keep in force or deliver to Beneficiary the
policies  of  insurance  required  by this  Deed of  Trust or by any of the Loan
Instruments,  Beneficiary  may (but shall have no  obligation  to) procure  such
insurance,  or single interest  insurance for such risks covering  Beneficiary's
interests,  and Trustor will pay all premiums  therefor  promptly upon demand by
Beneficiary;  and until such payment is made by Trustor,  the amount of all such
premiums,  together with interest thereon at the Advance Interest Rate, shall be
secured by this Deed of Trust.

         l.05.  Casualties.  Trustor shall give prompt written notice thereof to
Beneficiary  after the  happening of any casualty to or in  connection  with the
Trust Estate or any part thereof, whether or not covered by insurance.

         1.06.  Assignment  of  Policies  Upon  Foreclosure.  In  the  event  of
foreclosure  of this Deed of Trust or other  transfer of title or  assignment of
the Trust  Estate in  extinguishment,  in whole or in part,  of the debt secured
hereby,  then,  except with respect to blanket policies of insurance  carried by
Trustor,  all right,  title and interest of Trustor in and to all other policies
of  insurance  required by Section 1.03 hereof and any  unearned  premiums  paid
thereon  shall,  without  further  act,  be  assigned  to and shall inure to the
benefit of and pass to the  successor in interest to Trustor or the purchaser or
grantee of the Trust Estate, and Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints Beneficiary
its  lawful  attorney-in-fact  to execute an  assignment  thereof  and any other
document  necessary to effect such transfer.  The foregoing power of attorney is
coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.

         1.07.  Subrogation: Waiver of Offset.

                  (a)  Trustor  waives  any and all  right to  claim or  recover
against Beneficiary,  its officers,  employees, agents and representatives,  for
loss of or damage  to  Trustor,  the Trust  Estate,  Trustor's  property  or the
property of others under  Trustor's  control from any cause  insured  against or
required  to be  insured  against  by the  provisions  of this  Deed  of  Trust;
provided,  however,  that this waiver of subrogation shall not be effective with
respect to any policy of  insurance  permitted or required by this Deed of Trust
if (i) such policy  prohibits,  or if



                                       4
<PAGE>

coverage  thereunder would be reduced as a result of, such waiver of subrogation
and (ii)  Trustor is unable to obtain from a carrier  issuing  such  insurance a
policy  that,  by special  endorsement  or  otherwise,  permits such a waiver of
subrogation.

                  (b) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all sums
payable by Trustor  pursuant to this Deed of Trust shall be paid without notice,
demand,  counterclaim,  setoff,  deduction  or defense  and  without  abatement,
suspension,   deferment,  diminution  or  reduction,  and  the  obligations  and
liabilities  of Trustor  hereunder  shall in no way be released,  discharged  or
otherwise  affected (except as expressly  provided herein) by reason of: (i) any
damage to or destruction of or any  condemnation  or similar taking of the Trust
Estate  or  any  part  thereof;   (ii)  any  restriction  or  prevention  of  or
interference by any unaffiliated third party with any use of the Trust Estate or
any part thereof; (iii) any title defect or encumbrance or any eviction from the
Property  or any  part  thereof  by  title  paramount  or  otherwise;  (iv)  any
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization,  composition,  adjustment, dissolution,
liquidation  or other like  proceeding  relating to  Beneficiary,  or any action
taken  with  respect  to this  Deed of  Trust  by any  trustee  or  receiver  of
Beneficiary,  or by any  court,  in any such  proceeding;  (v) any  claim  which
Trustor has or might have  against  Beneficiary;  (vi) any default or failure on
the part of  Beneficiary to perform or comply with any of the terms hereof or of
any other  agreement  with Trustor;  or (vii) any other  occurrence  whatsoever,
whether  similar or  dissimilar to the  foregoing;  whether or not Trustor shall
have notice or knowledge of any of the foregoing.  Except as expressly  provided
herein,  Trustor  waives  all rights now or  hereafter  conferred  by statute or
otherwise to any abatement,  suspension,  deferment,  diminution or reduction of
any sum secured hereby and payable by Trustor.

         1.08  Taxes and Impositions.

                  (a)  Trustor   shall  pay,  or  cause  to  be  paid  prior  to
delinquency,  all real property taxes and assessments,  general and special, and
all other  taxes and  assessments  of any kind or nature  whatsoever  including,
without limitation,  non-governmental  levies or assessments such as maintenance
charges, levies or charges resulting from covenants, conditions and restrictions
affecting the Trust Estate, which are assessed or imposed upon the Trust Estate,
or upon  Trustor as owner or  operator  of the Trust  Estate,  or become due and
payable,  and which create, may create or appear to create a lien upon the Trust
Estate or any part thereof,  or upon any personal  property,  equipment or other
facility  used  in the  operation  or  maintenance  thereof  (all  of the  above
hereinafter referred to,  collectively,  as "Impositions");  provided,  however,
that if, by law,  any such  Imposition  is payable,  or may at the option of the
taxpayer be paid,  in  installments,  Trustor may pay the same or cause it to be
paid,  together  with  any  accrued  interest  on the  unpaid  balance  of  such
Imposition, in installments as the same become due and before any fine, penalty,
interest or cost may be added thereto for the nonpayment of any such installment
and interest.

                  (b) If at any  time  after  the  date  hereof  there  shall be
assessed or imposed (i) a tax or assessment on the Trust Estate in lieu of or in
addition to the Impositions  payable by Trustor  pursuant to subsection  1.08(a)
hereof,  or (ii) a license fee, tax or  assessment  imposed on  Beneficiary  and
measured  by or based in whole (or in part) upon the  amount of the  outstanding
obligations secured hereby,  then all (or said part of) such taxes,  assessments
or fees shall be deemed to be included within the term  "Impositions" as defined
in  subparagraph  (a) hereof,  and Trustor  shall pay and  discharge the same as
herein provided with respect to the payment of Impositions.  If Trustor fails to
pay such  Impositions  prior to  delinquency  or if Trustor is prohibited by law
from  paying  such  Impositions,  Beneficiary  may at  its  option  declare  all
obligations   secured  hereby  together  with  all  accrued  interest   thereon,
immediately due and payable.  Anything to the contrary  herein  notwithstanding,
Trustor  shall have no  obligation to pay any  franchise,  estate,  inheritance,
income,  excess  profits  or  similar  tax  levied  on  Beneficiary  or  on  the
obligations secured hereby.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (c) Subject to the  provisions of Subsection  1.08(d) and upon
request by Beneficiary,  Trustor shall deliver to Beneficiary within thirty (30)
days  after  the date upon  which any such  Imposition  is  delinquent  official
receipts of the appropriate  taxing  authority,  or other proof  satisfactory to
Beneficiary, evidencing the payment thereof.

                  (d) Trustor shall have the right before any delinquency occurs
to  contest  or  object to the  amount or  validity  of any such  Imposition  by
appropriate legal proceedings,  but this shall not be deemed or construed in any
way as  relieving,  modifying  or extending  Trustor's  covenant to pay any such
Imposition  at the time and in the manner  provided  herein  unless  Trustor has
given prior written notice to  Beneficiary of Trustor's  intent to so contest or
object to an Imposition,  and unless, at Beneficiary's  sole option, (i) Trustor
shall demonstrate to Beneficiary's satisfaction that the legal proceedings shall
conclusively  operate  to  prevent  the sale of the  Trust  Estate,  or any part
thereof,  to  satisfy  such  Imposition  prior  to final  determination  of such
proceedings; or (ii) Trustor shall furnish a good and sufficient bond, surety or
other assurances of payment as requested by and satisfactory to Beneficiary;  or
(iii) Trustor shall  demonstrate to Beneficiary's  satisfaction that Trustor has
provided a good and  sufficient  undertaking  as may be required or permitted by
law to accomplish a stay of any such sale.

                  (e)  Trustor  shall not suffer,  permit or initiate  the joint
assessment  of any real and  personal  property  which may  constitute  all or a
portion of the Trust Estate or suffer,  permit or initiate  any other  procedure
whereby  the  lien of the  real  property  taxes  and the  lien of the  personal
property  taxes shall be  assessed,  levied or charged to the Trust  Estate as a
single lien.

         1.09.  Utilities.  Trustor shall pay or shall cause to be paid when due
all utility  charges  which are  incurred  for the  benefit of the Trust  Estate
(excluding  therefrom utility charges, if any, incurred by tenants which are not
the obligation of the Trustor to pay under the terms of the leases) or which may
become a charge or lien against the Trust Estate for gas, electricity,  water or
sewer  services  furnished  to the Trust  Estate  and all other  assessments  or
charges of a similar nature, whether public or private,  affecting or related to
the Trust Estate or any portion thereof,  whether or not such taxes, assessments
or charges are or may become liens thereon.

         1.10. Defense of Actions and Costs.  Trustor,  at no cost or expense to
Beneficiary  or  Trustee,  shall  appear in and defend any action or  proceeding
purporting  to affect  the  security  hereof,  the other Loan  Instruments,  any
additional or other security for the obligations secured hereby, the interest of
Beneficiary,  or the  rights,  powers  or duties of  Beneficiary  hereunder.  If
Beneficiary elects to become a party to such action or proceeding,  or is made a
party thereto or to any other action or proceeding,  of whatever kind or nature,
concerning the Note, this Deed of Trust, any of the Loan Instruments,  the Trust
Estate or any part  thereof  or  interest  therein,  or the  occupancy  thereof,
Trustor shall to the extent such action or proceeding  relates to or arises from
events  occurring  subsequent  to Trustor's  acquisition  of the  Property:  (i)
indemnify,  defend and hold Trustee and Beneficiary harmless from all liability,
damage, cost and expense incurred by Trustee and Beneficiary, or either of them,
by reason of said action or proceeding (including, without limitation, Trustee's
fees and expenses,  the fees of attorneys for Trustee and for  Beneficiary,  and
other expenses, of whatever kind or nature,  incurred by Trustee or Beneficiary,
or either of them,  as a result of such  action or  proceeding),  whether or not
such action or proceeding  is prosecuted to judgment or decision;  and (ii) upon
written notice from Trustee or Beneficiary, assume the investigation and defense
of said action or  proceeding,  including the  employment of counsel  reasonably
acceptable  to  Beneficiary  and  the  payment  of  all  expenses.   Trustee  or
Beneficiary, as the case may be, shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any action or  proceeding  and to  participate  in the defense  thereof,  but
unless such separate  counsel is employed with the Trustor shall not be required
to pay the fees and expenses of such separate counsel.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  however, this provisions shall
not require Trustor to indemnify  Beneficiary or Trustee for any claims,  costs,
fees,  expenses or liabilities  arising from (i) the gross negligence or



                                       6
<PAGE>

willful  misconduct of  Beneficiary or Trustee and/or (ii) related to or arising
from  events  or  conditions  occurring  prior  to  Trustor's   acquisition  and
possession  of the  Property.  Immediately  upon  demand  therefor by Trustee or
Beneficiary, Trustor shall pay thereto an amount equal to Trustor's liability to
such person under this Section 1.10, together with interest thereon from date of
expenditure at the Advance  Interest  Rate;  and until paid,  such sums shall be
secured hereby.

         1.11.  Action by Beneficiary to Preserve Trust Estate. If Trustor fails
to make any payment or to do any act as and in the manner provided in any of the
Loan Instruments,  Beneficiary, in its own discretion,  without obligation so to
do,  without  releasing  Trustor  from any  obligation,  and subject only to the
notice and cure  provisions of the Note,  may make or do the same in such manner
and to such extent as  Beneficiary  may deem  necessary  to protect the security
hereof.  In  connection  therewith  (without  limiting  their  general and other
powers,  whether  conferred  herein,  in  another  Loan  Instrument  or by law),
Beneficiary  shall have and is hereby given the right,  but not the  obligation:
(i) to  enter  upon  and  take  possession  of the  Trust  Estate;  (ii) to make
additions,  alterations,  repairs and  improvements  to the Trust  Estate  which
Beneficiary  may  consider  necessary or proper to keep the Trust Estate in good
condition  and  repair;  (iii)  to  appear  and  participate  in any  action  or
proceeding  affecting or which may affect the  security  hereof or the rights or
powers of Beneficiary or Trustee;  (iv) to pay, purchase,  contest or compromise
any  encumbrance,  claim,  charge,  lien  or  debt  which  in  the  judgment  of
Beneficiary  may affect or appears to affect the  security of this Deed of Trust
or to be prior or superior  hereto;  and (v) in exercising  such powers,  to pay
necessary  expenses,  including  employment  of  counsel or other  necessary  or
desirable  consultants.  Trustor  shall,  immediately  upon  demand  therefor by
Beneficiary  pay to  Beneficiary  an  amount  equal to all  costs  and  expenses
incurred by it in connection  with the exercise by  Beneficiary of the foregoing
rights including,  without limitation,  costs of evidence of title, court costs,
appraisals,  surveys and receiver's,  trustee's and attorneys'  fees,  costs and
expenses whether or not an action is actually commenced in connection therewith,
together  with  interest  thereon  from  the  date  of such  expenditures  until
Beneficiary has been repaid such amount at the Advance  Interest Rate and, until
paid, said sums shall be secured hereby.

         1.12.  Survival  of  Warranties.  Trustor  shall  fully and  faithfully
satisfy  and  perform  the   obligations  of  Trustor   contained  in  the  Loan
Instruments,  each  agreement of Trustor  incorporated  by reference  therein or
herein and each agreement the  performance of which is secured  hereby,  and any
modification or amendment thereof. All representations, warranties and covenants
of Trustor  contained in any such Loan  Instrument or agreement  between Trustor
and Beneficiary shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and shall remain
continuing  obligations  of  Trustor  during  any time when any  portion  of the
obligations secured hereby remain outstanding.

         1.13.  Condemnation  and Other Awards.  Immediately  upon its obtaining
knowledge of the institution or the threatened institution of any proceeding for
the  condemnation  or other taking for public or  quasi-public  use of the Trust
Estate or any part thereof,  or if the same be taken or damaged by reason of any
public improvement or condemnation proceeding, or in any other manner, or should
Trustor  receive  any notice or other  information  regarding  such  proceeding,
action, taking or damage,  Trustor shall promptly notify Trustee and Beneficiary
of such fact.  Trustor shall then, if requested by  Beneficiary,  file or defend
its rights  thereunder  and  prosecute  the same with due diligence to its final
disposition  and  shall  cause  any  award  or  settlement  to be  paid  over to
Beneficiary for disposition  pursuant to the terms of this Deed of Trust. If the
Trust  Estate or any part  thereof  is taken or  diminished  in  value,  or if a
consent  settlement  is  entered,  by or under  threat of such  proceeding,  all
compensation,  awards,  damages,  rights of  action,  proceeds  and  settlements
payable  to  Trustor  by  virtue  of its  interest  in  the  Trust  Estate  (the
"Condemnation  Proceeds") shall be and hereby are assigned,  transferred and set
over  unto  Beneficiary  to be held by it,  in  trust,  subject  to the lien and
security interest of this Deed of Trust. Any such Condemnation Proceeds shall be
first applied to reimburse  Trustee and  Beneficiary for all costs and expenses,
including  reasonable attorneys fees, incurred in connection with the collection
of such award or settlement and costs of any  restoration  of the Property.  The
balance of such award or  settlement  shall be  applied in  accordance  with the
terms of the Note, as  applicable.  Application  or release of the  Condemnation
Proceeds  as  provided  herein



                                       7
<PAGE>

shall not cure or waive any default or notice of default hereunder or invalidate
any act done pursuant to such notice.

         1.14. Additional Security. No other security now existing, or hereafter
taken, to secure the obligations  secured hereby nor the liability of any maker,
surety, guarantor or endorser with respect to such obligations,  or any of them,
shall be impaired or affected by the  execution  of this Deed of Trust;  and all
additional  security  shall be taken,  considered  and held as  cumulative.  The
taking of additional security, execution of partial releases of the security, or
any extension of the time of payment of the indebtedness  shall not diminish the
force,  effect or lien of this Deed of Trust and shall not  affect or impair the
liability  of any maker,  surety,  guarantor or endorser for the payment of said
indebtedness. In the event Beneficiary at any time holds additional security for
any of the  obligations  secured  hereby,  it may  enforce  the sale  thereof or
otherwise realize upon the same, at its option, either before, concurrently,  or
after a sale is made hereunder.

         1.15. Inspections. Beneficiary, Trustee and the agents, representatives
or workers of each of them,  are authorized to enter upon  reasonable  notice at
any  reasonable  time upon or in any part of the Trust Estate for the purpose of
inspecting  the same and for the  purpose  of  performing  any of the acts it is
authorized  to  perform  hereunder  or  under  the  terms  of any  of  the  Loan
Instruments.

         1.16.  Liens.  Except for liens,  encumbrances  and charges approved by
Beneficiary  in writing,  Trustor shall pay and promptly  discharge when due, at
Trustor's cost and expense,  all liens,  encumbrances and charges upon the Trust
Estate, or any part thereof or interest therein;  provided that the existence of
any mechanic's, laborer's,  materialman's,  supplier's or vendor's lien or right
thereto shall not  constitute a violation of this Section 1.16 if payment is not
yet due under the contract which is the foundation  thereof and if such contract
does  not  postpone  payment  for more  than  forty-five  (45)  days  after  the
performance  thereof.  Trustor shall have the right to contest in good faith the
validity of any such lien,  encumbrance or charge,  provided Trustor shall first
deposit with Beneficiary a bond or other security satisfactory to Beneficiary in
such amounts as  Beneficiary  shall  reasonably  require,  but not more than one
hundred fifty percent  (150%) of the amount of the claim,  and provided  further
that Trustor shall thereafter diligently proceed to cause such lien, encumbrance
or charge to be removed and  discharged.  If Trustor shall fail either to remove
and discharge  any such lien,  encumbrance  or charge or to deposit  security in
accordance with the preceding sentence, if applicable,  then, in addition to any
other  right or  remedy  of  Beneficiary,  Beneficiary  may,  but  shall  not be
obligated to,  discharge the same,  without  inquiring into the validity of such
lien,  encumbrance  or charge nor into the  existence  of any  defense or offset
thereto,  either by paying the amount  claimed to be due,  or by  procuring  the
discharge of such lien, encumbrance or charge by depositing in a court a bond or
the amount  claimed or  otherwise  giving  security  for such claim,  or in such
manner as is or may be prescribed by law. Trustor shall, immediately upon demand
therefor by  Beneficiary,  pay to  Beneficiary  an amount equal to all costs and
expenses  incurred by Beneficiary in connection with the exercise by Beneficiary
of the  foregoing  right to  discharge  any such  lien,  encumbrance  or charge,
together with interest  thereon from the date of such expenditure at the Advance
Interest   Rate,   and,  until  paid,   such  sums  shall  be  secured   hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Beneficiary  consents to the lien of any deed(s)
of trust securing  financing for the construction of the  Improvements  provided
such lien shall be  subordinate  to the lien of this Deed of Trust.  Beneficiary
further agrees to execute such  agreements  and/or other documents as reasonably
requested by the beneficiary of any such subordinate deed of trust in connection
with any financing of the Improvements,  including reasonable amendments to this
Deed of Trust,  provided  the same  shall not  materially  impair the first lien
priority position of this Deed of Trust or Beneficiary's rights hereunder or the
adequacy of the Property to secure Trustor's obligations hereunder.

         1.17.  Beneficiary's  Powers.  Without  affecting  the liability of any
other person  liable for the payment of any  obligation  herein  mentioned,  and
without  affecting  the lien or charge of this Deed of Trust upon any portion of
the Trust  Estate not then or  theretofore  released  as  security  for the full
amount of all unpaid obligations,



                                       8
<PAGE>

Beneficiary  may, from time to time and without notice (i) release any person so
liable,  (ii)  extend  the  maturity  or  alter  any of the  terms  of any  such
obligation, (iii) grant other indulgences,  (iv) release or reconvey or cause to
be  released  or  reconveyed  at any time at  Beneficiary's  option any  parcel,
portion or all of the Trust Estate,  (v) take or release any other or additional
security for any obligation herein mentioned, or (vi) make compositions or other
arrangements  with  debtors  in  relation  thereto.   By  accepting  payment  or
performance of any obligation secured by this Deed of Trust after the payment or
performance  thereof  is due or after  the  filing of a notice  of  default  and
election to sell, Beneficiary shall not have thereby waived its right to require
prompt  payment  or  performance,  when due,  of all other  obligations  secured
hereby, or to declare a default for failure so to pay or perform,  or to proceed
with the sale under any notice of default and election to sell theretofore given
by  Beneficiary,  or with  respect  to any unpaid  balance  of the  indebtedness
secured hereby.  The acceptance by Beneficiary of any sum in an amount less than
the sum then due shall not  constitute a waiver of the  obligation of Trustor to
pay the  entire sum then due.  Trustor's  failure to pay the entire sum then due
shall  continue  to be a  default,  notwithstanding  the  acceptance  of partial
payment, and, until the entire sum then due shall have been paid, Beneficiary or
Trustee  shall at all times be entitled to declare a default and to exercise all
the remedies  herein  conferred,  and the right to proceed with a sale under any
notice of default and election to sell shall in no way be  impaired,  whether or
not such amounts are received  prior or subsequent  to such notice.  No delay or
omission  of  Trustee  or  Beneficiary  in the  exercise  of any  right or power
hereunder shall impair such right or power or any other right or power nor shall
the same be construed to be a waiver of any default or any acquiescence therein.

         1.18.  Environmental Compliance.

                  (a) As used in this Deed of Trust,  the following  definitions
shall apply:

<PAGE>

                  (b)  Trustor  shall not use,  produce,  process,  manufacture,
generate,  treat, handle, store or dispose of any Hazardous Substances in, on or

Release  any  Hazardous   Substances  into  any  air,  soil,  surface  water  or

used in the operation or maintenance of properties  similar to the Trust Estate,
provided  that the  amount of such  Hazardous  Substances  does not  exceed  the
quantity  necessary for the normal operation and maintenance of the Trust Estate
in the  ordinary  course of business  and the use,  storage and disposal of such
Hazardous  Substances  strictly comply with all applicable  Environmental  Laws.
Trustor shall  comply,  and shall cause all Persons using or occupying the Trust
Estate or any part thereof to comply,  with all Environmental Laws applicable to
the  Trust  Estate,  or the  use or  occupancy  thereof,  or any  operations  or
activities  therein or thereon.  Trustor shall obtain all permits,  licenses and
approvals  required  by all  applicable  Environmental  Laws  for  the  use  and
occupancy of, and all operations  and  activities  in, the Trust Estate,  comply
fully with all such permits,  licenses and approvals, and keep all such permits,
licenses  and  approvals  in full force and effect.  Immediately  after  Trustor
obtains any information  indicating that any Hazardous Substances may be present
or any  Release or  threatened  Release  of any  Hazardous  Substances  may have
occurred  in, on or under the Trust  Estate (or any nearby real  property  which
could migrate to the Trust  Estate) or that any  violation of any  Environmental
Laws may have occurred at the Trust Estate, Trustor shall give notice thereof to
Beneficiary with a reasonably detailed  description of the event,  occurrence or
condition in question.  Trustor shall immediately  furnish to Beneficiary copies
of all written  communications  received by Trustor  from any Person  (including
notices,  claims or  citations  that any  Release or  threatened  Release of any
Hazardous  Substances or any violation of any Environmental Laws has actually or
allegedly  occurred)  or given by Trustor to any Person  concerning  any past or
present  Release or  threatened  Release of any Hazardous  Substances  in, on or
under the Trust Estate (or any nearby real  property  which could migrate to the
Trust Estate) or any past or present violation of any Environmental  Laws at the
Trust Estate. If Beneficiary  obtains any information that Beneficiary  believes
in good faith indicates a reasonable  possibility that any Hazardous  Substances
may be present or any Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous  Substances
may have  occurred in, on or under the Trust Estate (or any nearby real property
which could migrate to the Trust  Estate) or any violation of any  Environmental
Laws may have occurred at the Trust Estate,  then Trustor shall,  at the expense
of  Trustor,  promptly  after  a  request  by  Beneficiary,   have  a  qualified
environmental  engineer investigate the presence,  Release or threatened Release
of  such   Hazardous   Substances   and  the  existence  of  such  violation  of
Environmental  Laws and  prepare  and  submit to  Beneficiary  a written  report
containing the findings and conclusions  resulting from such investigation.  The
environmental   engineer  who  will  prepare  the  report,   the  scope  of  the
investigation to be undertaken (which may include soil and groundwater sampling)
and the  methodology  to be used  shall be  subject  to the  prior  approval  of
Beneficiary.  Beneficiary (and its representatives) shall have the right, at all
reasonable  times and after  reasonable  prior notice (except no notice shall be
required in an  emergency),  to inspect the Trust  Estate and every part thereof
and to review all books,  records  and files of Trustor  relating to any past or
present  Release or  threatened  Release of any Hazardous  Substances  in, on or
under the Trust  Estate or any past or present  violation  of any  Environmental
Laws  at  the  Trust   Estate.   Trustor   shall  give   Beneficiary   (and  its
representatives)  access  to the Trust  Estate  and every  part  thereof  at all
reasonable  times (and at any time in an emergency) for such  purposes.  Trustor
shall promptly furnish in writing to Beneficiary all information  concerning any
past or present Release or threatened Release of any Hazardous Substances in, on
or under the Trust Estate or any past or present  violation of any Environmental
Laws at the Trust Estate that is requested from time to time by Beneficiary.

                  (c) If any  Release or  threatened  Release  of any  Hazardous
Substances  in, on or under the Trust  Estate  exists or occurs,  Trustor  shall
immediately  give notice of the  condition  to  Beneficiary,  and Trustor  shall
promptly  clean up and remove all  Hazardous  Substances  and  restore the Trust
Estate  (the  "Remediation  Work").  Trustor  shall  comply  with the orders and
directives  of all  Persons  having  jurisdiction  over the Trust  Estate or the
Remediation Work. Trustor shall submit to Beneficiary,  for Beneficiary's  prior
approval,  complete plans and specifications for all Remediation Work to be done
by Trustor  before any  Remediation  Work is


                                       10
<PAGE>

performed,  except  in an  emergency.  Such  plans and  specifications  shall be
prepared by qualified licensed  engineers or contractors  approved in writing by
Beneficiary,  shall  comply  with all  applicable  Environmental  Laws and other
applicable  laws,  ordinances,  rules  and  regulations,  shall  be  in  a  form
sufficient  to secure the  approval of all Persons  with  jurisdiction  over the
Trust Estate or the  Remediation  Work, and shall be otherwise  satisfactory  to
Beneficiary.  Trustor shall cause all Remediation Work to be performed in a good
and workmanlike manner by a qualified licensed contractor approved in writing by
Beneficiary,  under  the  supervision  of  a  qualified  environmental  engineer
approved  in  writing  by   Beneficiary,   in  accordance  with  the  plans  and
specifications for the Remediation Work approved in writing by Beneficiary,  and
in compliance with all applicable  Environmental Laws and other applicable laws,
ordinances,  rules and regulations.  Trustor shall obtain all required  permits,
licenses and approvals for the Remediation Work,  prosecute the Remediation Work
diligently,  and complete the Remediation Work in a timely manner. Trustor shall
pay for all Remediation  Work,  including the cost of plans and  specifications,
utilities,  permits, fees, taxes and insurance premiums in connection therewith.
Trustor  shall,  on demand,  pay to  Beneficiary  all direct costs and reimburse
Beneficiary  for all expenses  incurred by  Beneficiary  in connection  with any
review,  approval or inspection by Beneficiary relating to any Remediation Work,
together with interest  thereon from the date of  expenditure  until paid at the
Advance  Interest Rate except to the extent the  Remediation  Work relates to or
arises from events or conditions  occurring  prior to Trustor's  acquisition and
possession of the Property.  Under no circumstances  shall Beneficiary be liable
to Trustor for any damage,  loss, cost or expense incurred by Trustor on account
of any plans and specifications for the Remediation Work, the performance of any
Remediation  Work, or any delay in completion of any Remediation  Work except to
the extent the  Remediation  Work relates to or arises from events or conditions
occurring prior to Trustor's acquisition and possession of the Property. Trustor
shall furnish to Beneficiary,  promptly upon receipt or  preparation,  copies of
all  reports,  studies,  analyses,  investigations,  contracts,  correspondence,
claims, complaints,  pleadings and other information and communications received
or prepared by Trustor at any time in connection with any  Remediation  Work, or
any past or present  Release or threatened  Release of any Hazardous  Substances
in, on or under the Trust  Estate  (or any  nearby  real  property  which  could
migrate  to  the  Trust  Estate),  or  any  past  or  present  violation  of any
Environmental Laws at the Trust Estate. Beneficiary shall have the right, but no
obligation,  to participate in any action or proceeding  relating to any past or
present  Release or  threatened  Release of any Hazardous  Substances  in, on or
under the Trust Estate,  or any past or present  violation of any  environmental
Laws at the Trust Estate,  or the  necessity for or adequacy of any  Remediation
Work.

                  (d) Trustor shall  indemnify and defend  Beneficiary  (and its
directors,  officers,  employees,  agents and representatives)  against and hold
Beneficiary (and its directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives)
harmless  from all claims,  demands,  liabilities,  losses,  damages,  costs and
expenses  (collectively,  "Claims")  in any way  arising  from,  relating  to or
connected with the existence,  location,  nature, use, generation,  manufacture,
storage, disposal,  handling, or present or future Release or threatened Release
of any Hazardous  Substances in, on or under the Trust Estate, or any present or
future violation of any Environmental Laws at the Trust Estate, or any breach of
any  representation  or warranty  made by Trustor in this Deed of Trust,  or any
failure to perform any  obligation  of Trustor in  accordance  with this Deed of
Trust  except  to the  extent  such  Claims  relate to or arise  from  events or
conditions  occurring  prior to  Trustor's  acquisition  and  possession  of the
Property.   The  foregoing   indemnification   shall  include  all  expenses  of
investigation and monitoring, costs of containment,  abatement, removal, repair,
cleanup, restoration and remedial work, penalties and fines, attorneys' fees and
disbursements,  and other  response  costs.  If  Trustor  fails to  perform  any
obligation of Trustor in accordance with this Deed of Trust,  Beneficiary  shall
have the right,  but no  obligation,  to perform  such  obligation  on behalf of
Trustor.  Trustor  shall,  on demand,  pay to  Beneficiary  all sums expended by
Beneficiary in the performance of any such obligations of Trustor, together with
interest thereon from the date of expenditure until paid at the Advance Interest
Rate. If any Event of Default occurs under this Deed of Trust, Beneficiary shall
have  the  right,  but no  obligation,  at the  expense  of  Trustor,  to have a
comprehensive  environmental  assessment of the Trust Estate, including soil and
groundwater  sampling and in scope  satisfactory to Beneficiary,  prepared by an
engineer  selected by  Beneficiary  in order to ascertain  whether any hazardous
substances  are present or any Release or  threatened


                                       11
<PAGE>

Release  of any  Hazardous  Substances  has  occurred  in, on or under the Trust
Estate (or any nearby real property  which could migrate to the Trust Estate) or
any  violation of any  Environmental  Laws exists at the Trust  Estate.  Trustor
shall,  on demand,  pay to  Beneficiary  all sums  expended  by  Beneficiary  in
connection with any such comprehensive  environmental assessment,  together with
interest thereon from the date of expenditure until paid at the Advance Interest
Rate.

                  (e) The  obligation  of Trustor  under this  Section  1.18 are
separate  from and in  addition  to the  payment  and  performance  of the other
obligations  under  this Deed of Trust and the Note.  The  liability  of Trustor
under this Section 1.18 shall not be limited to or measured by the amount of the
indebtedness owed under the Note or this Deed of Trust or the value of the Trust
Estate.  Trustor shall be fully and  personally  liable for all  obligations  of
Trustor  under  this  Section  1.18 and a separate  action  may be  brought  and
prosecuted  against  Trustor under this Section  1.18.  The liability of Trustor
under this Section 1.18 shall not be subject to any  limitation set forth in the
Note or elsewhere  in this Deed of Trust,  or the  recourse of  Beneficiary  for
satisfaction  of  such  obligations.  Trustor  agrees  that  no  action  for the
enforcement  of or recovery of damages under this Section 1.18 shall  constitute
an action within the meaning of California Code of Civil Procedure ss 726, which
shall not apply to this Section  1.18,  and no judgment  against  Trustor in any
action  pursuant to this  Section 1.18 shall  constitute  a money  judgment or a
deficiency  judgment within the meaning of California Code of Civil Procedure ss
ss 580a,  580b,  580d or 726. This Section 1.18 and the  obligations  of Trustor
hereunder  shall  survive,  and  remain in full  force  and  effect  after,  any
reconveyance  of this  Deed of Trust or any  foreclosure  of this  Deed of Trust
(whether by  judicial  action,  exercise  of the power of sale,  deed in lieu of
foreclosure,  or otherwise) with respect to any past,  present or future Release
or  threatened  Release of any  Hazardous  Substances  in, on or under the Trust
Estate or any past, present or future violation of any Environmental Laws at the
Trust  Estate  which  occurred,  or the  onset of which  occurred,  before  such
reconveyance  or foreclosure,  and  Beneficiary  shall have the right to enforce
this Section 1.18 after any such reconveyance or foreclosure. Trustor waives the
right to assert any statute of limitations  as a bar to the  enforcement of this
Section 1.18 or to any action brought to enforce this Section 1.18. This Section
1.18 shall not affect,  impair or waive any rights or remedies of Beneficiary or
Trustor  or any  obligations  of  Beneficiary  or of  Trustor  with  respect  to
Hazardous  Substances  created  or  imposed  by  Environmental  Laws  (including
Beneficiary's rights of reimbursement or contribution under Environmental Laws).
The remedies in this Section 1.18 are cumulative and in addition to all remedies
provided by law.

         1.19.  Other  Instruments.  Except as otherwise  expressly  provided in
Subsection 1.08(d) hereof with respect to Impositions,  Trustor shall punctually
pay all amounts due and payable,  and shall promptly and  faithfully  perform or
observe  each and  every  other  obligation  or  condition  to be  performed  or
observed,  under  each deed of trust,  mortgage  or other  lien or  encumbrance,
lease, sublease, declaration,  covenant, condition,  restriction, license, order
or other  instrument  or agreement  which affects or appears to affect the Trust
Estate, whether at law or in equity.

                               SECURITY AGREEMENT

         3.01.   Creation  of  Security  Interest.   Trustor  hereby  grants  to
Beneficiary a security  interest in the Personal  Property and in all amounts of
money  now or at any  time  hereafter  deposited  with or in the  possession  of
Beneficiary  (all of the  foregoing  items are referred to  collectively  as the
"Collateral")  for the  purpose of securing  the  indebtedness  and  obligations
secured by this Deed of Trust.

         3.02.  Warranties,  Representations  and Covenants of Trustor.  Trustor
hereby warrants, represents and covenants as follows:

                  (a) Except for the security  interest granted hereby,  Trustor
is, and as to portions of the  Collateral  to be acquired  after the date hereof
will be,  the sole  owner  of the  Collateral,  free  from  any  lien,  security
interest,  encumbrance or adverse claim thereon of any kind whatsoever.  Trustor
shall notify  Beneficiary of, and shall indemnify and defend Beneficiary and the
Collateral  against,  all claims and demands of all persons at any time claiming
the Collateral or any part thereof or any interest therein.

                  (b) The  Collateral  is not,  and shall not be, used or bought
for personal, family or household purposes.

                  (c) The Personal  Property shall be kept on or at the Property
and Trustor shall not remove the Personal Property from the Property without the
prior  consent of  Beneficiary,  except for such  portions  or items of Personal
Property as are  consumed or worn out in ordinary  usage,  all of which  Trustor
shall promptly replace with new items of equal or better quality.

                  (d)  Trustor  maintains  a place of  business  in the State of
California  at the  address  set forth in this Deed of Trust and  Trustor  shall
immediately  notify  Beneficiary  in  writing  of any  change  in its  place  of
business.

                  (e) At the request of  Beneficiary,  Trustor shall execute one
or more financing  statements and continuations and amendments  thereof pursuant
to  the  Uniform   Commercial  Code  of  California  in  form   satisfactory  to
Beneficiary,  and  Trustor  shall pay the cost of filing  the same in all public
offices whenever and wherever filing is deemed by Beneficiary to be necessary or
desirable.

                  (f) All  covenants  and  agreements of Trustor in this Deed of
Trust  relating  to the Trust  Estate  shall be deemed to apply to the  Personal
Property whether or not expressly referred to herein.

                  (g) This Deed of Trust  constitutes  a security  agreement  as
that term is used in the Uniform  Commercial  Code of  California.  This Deed of
Trust is also a financing statement (fixture filing),  covers goods which are or
are to  become  fixtures,  and is to be  recorded  in the real  estate  records.
Trustor is the record owner of the Property.


                                   ARTICLE IV
                              REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

         4.01. Event of Default.  Any of the following events shall be deemed to
be an event of default ("Event of Default") hereunder:

                                       13
<PAGE>

                  (a)      Default  shall be made in the  payment,  when due, of
                           any sum secured  hereby and such default is not cured
                           within  ten (10) days of  written  notice to  Trustor
                           that such sums are due; or

                  (b)     There  shall  occur a breach of or  default  under any
                          other  covenant,  agreement or  obligation  of Trustor
                          contained  herein,  and such  breach or default  shall
                          remain  unremedied  for  thirty  (30)  days  following
                          written  notice to Trustor of such default unless such
                          default  cannot  reasonably  be  remedied  within such
                          thirty (30) day period and provided Trustor  commences
                          and  diligently  proceeds to remedy the default within
                          such period;

                  (c)     There shall occur a default  under the Note beyond any
                          applicable grace period; or

                  (d)     There  shall  occur a  default  under any of the other
                          Loan Instruments.

         4.02.   Acceleration  Upon  Default:   Additional  Remedies.  Upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default,  Beneficiary may, at its option,  declare all
indebtedness  and  obligations  secured hereby to be immediately due and payable
without any presentment,  demand,  protest or notice of any kind; and whether or
not Beneficiary exercises said option, Beneficiary may:

                  (a) Either in person or by agent, with or without bringing any
action or proceeding, appointed by a court and without regard to the adequacy of
its security,  enter upon and take  possession of the Trust Estate,  or any part
thereof,  in its own name or in the  name of  Trustee,  and do any act  which it
deems necessary or desirable to preserve the value, marketability or rentability
of the Trust Estate,  or part thereof or interest  therein,  increase the income
therefrom or protect the security hereof and, with or without taking  possession
of the Trust Estate. The entering upon and taking possession of the Trust Estate
shall not cure or waive any default or notice of default hereunder or invalidate
any act done in response  to such  default or pursuant to such notice of default
and, notwithstanding the continuance in possession by Trustee,  Beneficiary or a
receiver of all or any portion of the Trust Estate,  the Trustee or  Beneficiary
shall be  entitled  to  exercise  every  right  provided  for in any of the Loan
Instruments  or by law upon  occurrence  of any Event of Default,  including the
right to exercise the power of sale;

                  (b)  Commence an action to  foreclose  this Deed of Trust as a
mortgage,  appoint a receiver,  or  specifically  enforce  any of the  covenants
hereof;

                  (c)  Deliver to Trustee a written  declaration  of default and
demand for sale, and a written notice of default and election to cause Trustor's
interest in the Trust Estate to be sold, which notice the Trustee or Beneficiary
shall cause to be duly filed for record in the Official Records of the County in
which the Land is located; or

                  (d) Exercise all other rights and remedies provided herein, in
any Loan Instrument or other document or agreement now or hereafter securing all
or any portion of the obligations secured hereby, or provided by law.

         4.03.  Foreclosure By Power of Sale.

                  (a) Should  Beneficiary  elect to foreclose by exercise of the
power of sale  herein  contained,  Beneficiary  shall  notify  Trustee and shall
deposit  with  Trustee  this Deed of Trust and such  receipts  and  evidence  of
expenditures made and secured hereby as Trustee may require.

                                       14
<PAGE>

                  (b) Upon  receipt of such  notice  from  Beneficiary,  Trustee
shall cause to be recorded,  published  and  delivered to Trustor such Notice of
Default and Election to Sell as is then required by law. Trustee shall,  without
demand on  Trustor,  after lapse of such time as may then be required by law and
after recordation of such Notice of Default and after Notice of Sale having been
given as  required by law,  sell the Trust  Estate at the time and place of sale
fixed by it in said Notice of Sale,  either as a whole,  or in separate  lots or
parcels or items,  and in such order as Beneficiary may direct Trustee so to do,
at public  auction to the highest  bidder for cash in lawful money of the United
States  payable at the time of sale.  Trustee shall deliver to such purchaser or
purchasers  thereof its good and sufficient deed or deeds conveying the property
so sold, but without any covenant or warranty,  express or implied. The recitals
in such deed of any matter or fact shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness
thereof.  Any  person  including,   without  limitation,   Trustor,  Trustee  or
Beneficiary may purchase at such sale.

                  (c)  After   deducting   all  costs,   fees  and  expenses  of
Beneficiary and Trustee, including costs of evidence of title in connection with
sale, Beneficiary shall apply the proceeds of sale in the following priority, to
payment of (i) first, all sums expended under the terms hereof, not then repaid,
with accrued interest at the Advance Interest Rate; (ii) second,  all other sums
then secured hereby;  and (iii) the remainder,  if any, to the person or persons
legally entitled thereto.

                  (d) Subject to California  Civil Code Section  2924g,  Trustee
may  postpone  sale  of  all or  any  portion  of the  Trust  Estate  by  public
announcement  at such time and place of sale,  and from time to time  thereafter
may postpone such sale by public announcement or subsequently  noticed sale, and
without   further  notice  make  such  sale  at  the  time  fixed  by  the  last
postponement, or may, in its discretion, give a new notice of sale.

                  (e) A sale of less than the  whole of the Trust  Estate or any
defective or irregular sale made  hereunder  shall not exhaust the power of sale
provided  for  herein;  and  subsequent  sales may be made  hereunder  until all
obligations secured hereby have been satisfied, or the entire Trust Estate sold,
without defect or irregularity.

         4.04.  Intentionally Omitted.

         4.05.  Application of Funds After Default.  Except as otherwise  herein
provided,  upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
hereunder, Beneficiary may, at any time without notice, apply any or all sums or
amounts received and held by Beneficiary to pay insurance premiums, Impositions,
or either of them, or as rents or income of the Trust Estate, or as insurance or
condemnation  proceeds,  and all other sums or amounts  received by  Beneficiary
from or on  account  of  Trustor or the Trust  Estate,  or  otherwise,  upon any
indebtedness or obligation of Trustor  secured hereby,  in such manner and order
as  Beneficiary  may  elect,  notwithstanding  that  said  indebtedness  or  the
performance  of  said  obligation  may  not  yet be  due.  The  receipt,  use or
application  of any such sum or amount  shall  not be  construed  to affect  the
maturity of any indebtedness secured by this Deed of Trust, or any of the rights
or powers of Beneficiary or Trustee under the terms of the Loan Instruments,  or
any of the obligations of Trustor or any guarantor  under the Loan  Instruments;
or to cure or waive  any  default  or notice  of  default  under any of the Loan
Instruments or to invalidate any act of Trustee or Beneficiary.

         4.06. Costs of Enforcement. If any Event of Default occurs, Beneficiary
and  Trustee,  and each of them,  may employ an attorney or attorneys to protect
their rights hereunder.  Trustor promises to pay to Beneficiary,  on demand, the
reasonable  fees and  expenses of such  attorneys  and all other actual costs of
enforcing  the  obligations   secured  hereby  including,   without  limitation,
recording  fees, the expense of a Trustee's Sale  Guarantee,  Trustee's fees and
expenses, receivers' fees and expenses, and all other expenses, of whatever kind
or nature,  incurred by Beneficiary and Trustee, and each of them, in connection
with the  enforcement of the  obligations  secured  hereby,


                                       15
<PAGE>

whether or not such  enforcement  includes the filing of a lawsuit.  Until paid,
such  sums  shall by  secured  hereby  and  shall  bear  interest,  from date of
expenditure, at the Advance Interest Rate.

         4.07.  Remedies Not  Exclusive.  Trustee and  Beneficiary,  and each of
them,  shall be entitled to enforce payment and performance of any  indebtedness
or  obligation  secured  hereby and to exercise all rights and powers under this
Deed of Trust or under any Loan  Instrument or other agreement or any law now or
hereafter in force,  notwithstanding  some or all of the said  indebtedness  and
obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise secured, whether by
guaranty,  mortgage,  deed of trust,  pledge,  lien,  assignment  or  otherwise.
Neither  the  acceptance  of this Deed of Trust nor its  enforcement  whether by
court action or pursuant to the power of sale or other powers herein  contained,
shall  prejudice or in any manner  affect  Trustee's or  Beneficiary's  right to
realize upon or enforce any other  security now or hereafter  held by Trustee or
Beneficiary,  it being  agreed that Trustee and  Beneficiary,  and each of them,
shall be entitled to enforce  this Deed of Trust and any other  security  now or
hereafter held by Beneficiary or Trustee in such order and manner as they may in
their absolute discretion determine. No remedy herein conferred upon or reserved
to Trustee or Beneficiary is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy herein
or by law provided or permitted,  but each shall be  cumulative  and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given  hereunder or now or hereafter  existing at
law or in equity or by statute.  Every power or remedy  given by any of the Loan
Instruments  to  Trustee  or  Beneficiary  or to  which  either  of them  may be
otherwise entitled may be exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to
time and as often as may be deemed  expedient  by  Trustee or  Beneficiary,  and

all rights of redemption, valuation,  appraisement, stay of execution, notice of
election  to mature or declare  due the whole of the  secured  indebtedness  and
marshaling in the event of  foreclosure of the liens hereby  created,  and (iii)
all rights and remedies which Trustor may have or be able to assert by reason of
the laws of the State of  California  pertaining  to the rights and  remedies of
sureties;  provided,  however,  nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a
waiver of Trustor's rights under Section 2924c of the California Civil Code.

         5.03.  Statement by Trustor.  Trustor shall, within ten (10) days after

accordance with  Beneficiary's  customary charges therefor or the actual cost to
Beneficiary therefor, whichever is more.

         5.05.  Reconveyance  by  Trustee.  So long  as no  default  shall  have
occurred in the performance or observance of Trustor's covenants, agreements and
obligations  under the Note,  then upon written  request of Beneficiary  stating

and  upon  surrender  by  Beneficiary  of this  Deed of  Trust  to  Trustee  for
cancellation and retention and upon payment by Trustor of Trustee's fees and the
costs and  expenses of  executing  and  recording  any  requested  Reconveyance,
Trustee shall reconvey to Trustor,  or to the person or persons legally entitled
thereto,  without warranty, any portion of the Trust Estate then held hereunder.
The recitals in any such  reconveyance of any matter of fact shall be conclusive
proof of the truthfulness  thereof.  The grantee in any such reconveyance may be
described as "the person or persons legally entitled thereto."

         5.07. Acceptance by Trustee.  Trustee accepts this Trust when this Deed
of Trust is duly  executed  and  acknowledged  and is made a  public  record  as
provided by law.

         5.08. Captions.  The captions or headings at the beginning of Articles,
Sections and Subsections hereof are for the convenience of the parties,  are not
a part of this Deed of Trust, and shall not be used in construing it.

         5.09. Invalidity of Certain Provisions. Every provision of this Deed of
Trust is intended to be severable.  In the event any term or provision hereof is
declared to be illegal,  invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such illegality, invalidity or unenforceability
shall not affect the balance of the terms and provisions hereof, which terms and
provisions  shall remain  binding and  enforceable.  If the lien of this Deed of
Trust is invalid or  unenforceable as to any part of the debt, or if the lien is
invalid or  unenforceable  as to any part of the Trust Estate,  the unsecured or
partially  secured  portion  of the debt shall be  completely  paid prior to the
payment of the remaining and secured or partially  secured  portion of the debt,
and all payments made on the debt,  whether  voluntary or under  foreclosure  or
other  enforcement  action or procedure,  shall be considered to have been first
paid on and applied to the full payment of that portion of the debt which is not
secured or fully secured by the lien of this Deed of Trust.

         5.10. No Merger of Leases.  Upon the foreclosure of the lien created by
this Deed of Trust on the Trust Estate  pursuant to the provisions  hereof,  any
lease or sublease  then  existing and  affecting all or any portion of the Trust
Estate shall not be destroyed or terminated by  application of the law of merger
or as a matter of law or as a result of such foreclosure  unless  Beneficiary or
any purchaser at such foreclosure sale shall so elect. No act by or on behalf of
Beneficiary or any such purchaser shall constitute a termination of any lease or
sublease unless  Beneficiary or such purchaser shall give written notice of such
termination  to such tenant or  subtenant.  If both the  lessor's  and  lessee's
estate under any lease or any portion  thereof  which  constitutes a part of the
Trust  Estate shall at any time become  vested in one owner,  this Deed of Trust
and the lien created  hereby shall not be destroyed or terminated by application
of the doctrine of merger unless Beneficiary so elects as evidenced by recording
a written  declaration so stating,  and, unless and until Beneficiary so elects,
Beneficiary shall continue to have and enjoy all of the rights and privileges of
Beneficiary hereunder as to the separate estates.

         5.11.  Governing  Law.  This  Deed of Trust  shall be  governed  by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.

         5.12.  Statute  of  Limitations.  Except  insofar  as now or  hereafter
prohibited by law, the right to plead,  use or assert any statute of limitations
as a plea or defense or bar of any kind, or for any purpose, to any debt, demand
or  obligation  secured or to be secured  hereby,  or to any  complaint or other
pleading  or  proceeding  filed,  instituted  or  maintained  for the purpose of
enforcing  this  Deed of Trust or any  rights  hereunder,  is  hereby  waived by
Trustor.

         5.13.  Joint  and  Several  Obligations.  Should  this Deed of Trust be
signed by more than one party, all obligations  herein contained shall be deemed
to be the joint and several  obligations  of each party  executing  this Deed of
Trust. Any married person signing this Deed of Trust agrees that recourse may be
had against  community  assets and against his or her separate  property for the
satisfaction of all obligations contained herein.

         5.l4. Interpretation.  In this Deed of Trust the singular shall include
the plural and the  masculine  shall  include the  feminine  and neuter and vice
versa,  if the  context  so  requires;  and  the  word  "person"  shall  include
corporation, partnership or other form of association.

         5.15.  Trust  Irrevocable:  No  Offset.  The  Trust  created  hereby is
irrevocable by Trustor. No offset or claim that Trustor now or may in the future
have against  Beneficiary  shall relieve Trustor from paying the indebtedness or
performing any other obligation contained herein or secured hereby.

                                       18

         5.16. Corrections. Trustor shall, upon request of Beneficiary, promptly
correct any defect,  error or omission  which may be  discovered in the contents
hereof  or  in  the  execution  or  acknowledgment  hereof,  and  will  execute,
acknowledge and deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may
be necessary or as may be reasonably  requested by Beneficiary to carry out more
effectively the purposes  hereof,  to subject to the lien and security  interest
hereby  created  any of  Trustor's  properties,  rights or  interest  covered or
intended to be covered hereby, or to perfect and maintain such lien and security
interest.

         5.17. Further Assurances.  Trustor, Beneficiary and Trustee agree to do
or to cause to be done such  further  acts and things and to execute and deliver
or  to  cause  to  be  executed  and  delivered  such  additional   assignments,
agreements,  powers and  instruments,  as any of them may reasonably  require or
deem advisable to keep valid and effective the charges and lien hereof, to carry
into effect the  purposes of this Deed of Trust or to better  assure and confirm
unto any of them their rights, powers and remedies hereunder;  and, upon request
by  Beneficiary,  shall supply  evidence of fulfillment of each of the covenants
herein contained concerning which a request for such evidence has been made.

         5.18.  Execution of Documents by Trustee. At any time, and from time to
time,  without  liability  therefor and without notice,  upon written request of
Beneficiary and  presentation of this Deed of Trust,  and without  affecting the
personal  liability  of  any  person  for  payment  of the  indebtedness  or the
performance of any other obligation secured hereby or the effect of this Deed of
Trust upon the remainder of said Trust Estate, Trustee may (i) reconvey any part
of said Trust  Estate,  (ii) consent in writing to the making of any map or plat
thereof,  (iii)  join in  granting  any  easement  thereon,  or (iv) join in any
extension agreement, agreement subordinating the lien or charge hereof, or other
agreement or  instrument  relating  hereto or to the Trust Estate or any portion
thereof.

         5.19. Appointment of Successor Trustee. Trustee or any successor acting
hereunder may resign and thereupon be  discharged of the trusts  hereunder  upon
thirty (30) days'  written  notice to  Beneficiary.  Regardless  of whether such
resignation occurs,  Beneficiary may, from time to time,  substitute a successor
or successors to any Trustee named herein or acting hereunder in accordance with
any statutory  procedure for such substitution;  or if Beneficiary,  in its sole
discretion,  so elects,  Beneficiary may substitute such successor or successors
by recording  in the office of the recorder of the county or counties  where the
Land is situated, an instrument executed by Beneficiary, and containing the name
of the original Trustor,  Trustee and Beneficiary  hereunder,  the book and page
where  this  Deed of Trust is  recorded  and the  name  and  address  of the new
Trustee,  which instrument  shall be conclusive proof of proper  substitution of
such successor Trustee or Trustees,  who shall succeed,  without conveyance from
the  predecessor  Trustee,  all its  title,  estate,  rights,  powers and duties
hereunder.

         5.20.  Successors and Assigns. This Deed of Trust applies to, inures to
the  benefit  of  and  binds   Trustor  and  its  heirs,   legatees,   devisees,
administrators,  personal  representatives,  executors  and the  successors  and
assigns thereof, Trustee and Beneficiary. As used herein, the term "Beneficiary"
shall mean the  holder or holders of the Note from time to time,  whether or not
named as Beneficiary herein; the term "Trustee" shall mean the trustee appointed
hereunder from time to time, whether or not notice of such appointment is given;
and  the  term   "Trustor"   shall  mean  the  Trustor   named  herein  and  the
successors-in-interest, if any, of said named Trustor in and to the Trust Estate
or any part  thereof.  If  there  be more  than  one  Trustor  hereunder,  their
obligations shall be joint and several.

         5.21.  Priority.  This  Deed of Trust is  intended  to have and  retain
priority over all other liens and encumbrances upon the Trust Estate,  excepting
only: (i) such impositions as at the date hereof have, or by law gain,  priority
over  the  lien  created  hereby;  (ii)  covenants,  conditions,   restrictions,
easements,  and rights of way which are of record or are disclosed of record and
which  affect the Trust  Estate on the date  hereof;  and (iii)  leases,  liens,
encumbrances  and other  matters  as to which  Beneficiary  hereafter  expressly
subordinates the lien of this



                                       19
<PAGE>

Deed of Trust by written  instrument in recordable  form.  Under no circumstance
shall Beneficiary be obligated or required to subordinate the lien hereof to any
lease, lien, encumbrance, covenant or other matter affecting the Trust Estate or
any  portion  thereof.   Beneficiary  may,  however,  at  Beneficiary's  option,
exercisable in its sole and absolute  discretion,  subordinate  the lien of this
Deed of Trust, in whole or in part, to any or all leases, liens, encumbrances or
other matters  affecting all or any portion of the Trust Estate by executing and
recording in the Office of the County  Recorder of the County and State in which
the Land is located, a unilateral  declaration of such subordination  specifying
the lease,  lien,  encumbrance  or other matter or matters to which this Deed of
Trust shall thereafter be subordinate.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  upon the
request  of  Trustor,   Beneficiary  agrees  to  execute  a  nondisturbance  and
attornment agreement with tenant(s) under any lease(s) of the Property providing
that so long as such  tenant is not in default  of the terms of its lease,  upon
and following a foreclosure of this Deed of Trust, Beneficiary shall not disturb
the possession of such tenant in accordance with the terms of its lease.

         5.22.  Financing Statement and Fixture Filing.

                  (a) This Deed of Trust  constitutes a financing  statement and
fixture filing in the Official  Records of the County Recorder of the County and
State in which the  Property is located with respect to any and all Fixtures (as
hereinafter  defined)  included with the term  "Improvements" as used herein and
with respect to any goods, collateral or other personal property that may now be
or hereafter become Fixtures. As used herein, the term "Fixtures" shall mean all
fixtures located upon or within the  Improvements or now or hereafter  installed
in,  or used in  connection  with any of the  Improvements,  including,  but not
limited to, any and all partitions,  screens, awnings, motors, engines, boilers,
furnaces,  pipes,  plumbing,  elevators,  cleaning and sprinkler  systems,  fire
extinguishing apparatus and equipment,  water tanks, heating,  ventilating,  air
conditioning, and air cooling equipment,  refrigerators, washer and dryer units,
and gas and electric  machinery,  appurtenances  and  equipment,  whether or not
permanently affixed to the Property or Improvements.

                  (b)  It  is  understood   and  agreed  that,  to  protect  the
Beneficiary  against the effect of California  Commercial  Code Section 9313, as
amended  from  time to time,  in the  event  that (x) any  Fixture  owned by the
Trustor in the Trust Estate,  or any part  thereof,  is replaced or added to, or
any new Fixture  owned by the Trustor is installed  by the Trustor,  and in each
case such  Fixture  has a cost or fair  market  value in excess of Ten  Thousand
Dollars  ($10,000.00),  and (y) such  Fixture is or may be subject to a security
interest held by a seller or any other party:

                           (i)  Trustor  or any  owner of all or any part of the
Trust Estate shall,  before the  replacement,  addition,  or installation of any
such Fixture, obtain the prior written approval of the Beneficiary, and give the
Beneficiary  written  notice  that a  security  agreement  with  respect to such
Fixture  has  been  or will be  consummated,  which  notice  shall  contain  the
following information:

                                    (A)     a description  of the Fixtures to be
                                            replaced,  added  to,  installed  or
                                            substituted;

                                    (B)     a recital of the  location  at which
                                            the Fixtures will be replaced, added
                                            to, installed or substituted;

                                    (C)     a statement  of the name and address
                                            of  the  holder  and  amount  of the
                                            security interest; and

                                    (D)     the  date  of the  purchase  of such
                                            Fixtures.

                                       20
<PAGE>

                  Neither this  subparagraph  nor any consent by the Beneficiary
pursuant to this  subparagraph  shall constitute an agreement to subordinate any
right of the  Beneficiary in Fixtures or other property  covered by this Deed of
Trust.

                           (ii) The Beneficiary may, at its option, at any time,
pay the balance due under said  security  agreement and the amount so paid shall
be (A)  secured  by this Deed of Trust  and shall be a lien on the Trust  Estate
enjoying the same  priorities  vis-a-vis  the estates and  interests  encumbered
hereby as this Deed of Trust,  and (B)  payable on demand  with  interest at the
Advance  Interest  Rate  from the time of such  payment  as  aforesaid;  and the
Beneficiary  shall have the privilege of acquiring by assignment from the holder
of said  security  interest any and all contract  rights,  accounts  receivable,
chattel paper,  negotiable or non-negotiable  instruments,  or other evidence of
the Trustor's indebtedness for such Fixtures,  and, upon acquiring such interest
aforesaid by assignment,  shall have the right to enforce the security  interest
as  assignee  thereof,  in  accordance  with the  terms  and  provisions  of the
California  Commercial Code, as amended or supplemented,  and in accordance with
the law.

                           (iii)  Whether  or not the  Beneficiary  has  paid or
taken an assignment of such security interest,  if at any time the Trustor shall
be in default  under the security  agreement  covering  the Fixtures  beyond the
applicable  cure period  therefor,  if any, as specified  therein,  such default
shall be a material breach of the Trustor's  covenants under this Deed of Trust,
and shall at the option of the Beneficiary  constitute a default under this Deed
of Trust.

                           (iv) The provisions of  subparagraphs  (ii) and (iii)
above  shall not apply if the goods  which may become  Fixtures  are of at least
equivalent value and quality as any property being replaced and if the rights of
the party holding such security interest have been expressly subordinated, at no
cost to the  Beneficiary,  to the  lien  of  this  Deed  of  Trust  in a  manner
satisfactory to the Beneficiary, including, without limitation, at the option of
the Beneficiary,  providing to the Beneficiary a satisfactory opinion of counsel
to the effect that this Deed of Trust  constitutes a valid and subsisting  first
lien on such  Fixtures  which is not  subordinate  to the lien of such  security
interest under any applicable law, including, without limitation, the provisions
of Section 9313 of the California Commercial Code.


                  IN WITNESS  THEREOF,  Trustor has caused this Deed of Trust to
be executed by its duly  authorized  agents and  representatives  as of the date
first above written.

                               CONTINUING GUARANTY



         To induce ELECTRONIC ARTS REDWOOD,  INC.  (hereinafter called "Lender")
to    grant    credit    and    or    make    financial     accommodation     to
____________________________,   a   _____________________________   (hereinafter
called  "Borrower")  and in  consideration  thereof of any loans,  advances,  or
financial accommodations heretofore or hereafter granted by Lender to or for the
account  of  Borrower,   the  undersigned   (hereinafter   called   "Guarantor")
unconditionally  guarantees and promises to pay Lender,  or order, on demand, in
lawful money of the United  States,  any and all  indebtedness  (as  hereinafter
defined)  of  Borrower  to Lender  under any  existing  or future  agreement  or
otherwise,  and also  guarantee  the due  performance  by Borrower of all of its
obligations under all existing and future contracts and agreements with Lender.

         1. The word  "indebtedness"  means the loan  evidenced  by that certain
Promissory Note made by Borrower to Lender in the original  principal  amount of
________________________________Dollars    ($________________)   (the   "Note"),
secured by a deed of trust on the property  located at Redwood  Shores,  Redwood
City, California,  as described in Exhibit A attached hereto,  together with all
renewals,  extensions,  modifications  and/or  substitutions of or for the Note,
including all principal, interest, collection costs and expenses relating to the
Note or any  collateral  for the Note.  Collection  costs and expenses  include,
without limitation,  all of Lender's attorneys' fees and legal expenses, whether
or not suit is instituted, and all foreclosure expenses.

         2. This Guaranty is a Continuing  Guaranty which shall remain effective
until all of the  indebtedness  has been finally paid in full,  at which time it
shall be of no further force or effect.

         3. The obligations  hereunder are joint and several, and independent of
the obligations of Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and
prosecuted  against  Guarantor,  whether action is brought  against  Borrower or
whether  Borrower is joined in any such action or actions,  and Guarantor waives
the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting their liability hereunder or
the enforcement hereof.

         4. Guarantor  authorizes  Lender,  without notice or demand and without
affecting their liability hereunder, from time to time to (a) renew, compromise,
extend,  accelerate  or  otherwise  change the time for payment of, or otherwise
change  the terms of the  indebtedness  or any part  thereof;  (b) take and hold
security for the payment of this Guaranty or the  indebtedness  guaranteed,  and
exchange,  enforce, waive and release any such security; (c) apply such security
and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Lender in its sole  discretion
may determine; and (d) assign, without notice, this Guaranty in whole or in part
and/or Lender's rights hereunder to anyone at any time.

                                      -1-

         5. Guarantor  waives all rights and defenses arising out of an election
of  remedies  by  Lender,  even  though  that  election  of  remedies,  such  as
nonjudicial  foreclosure  with respect to security for a guaranteed  obligation,
has  destroyed  Guarantor's  rights of  subrogation  and  reimbursement  against
Borrower by the  operation  of Section  580d of the Code of Civil  Procedure  or
otherwise,  and/or any similar law of California,  or of any other State,  or of
the United States.  Guarantor  waives any right to require Lender to (a) proceed
against  Borrower;  (b)  proceed  against  or  exhaust  any  security  held from
Borrower; or (c) pursue any other remedy in Lender's power whatsoever. Guarantor
waives any  defense  arising  by reason of any  disability  or other  defense of
Borrower  or by  reason  of the  cessation  from  any  cause  whatsoever  of the
liability of Borrower.  Guarantor  also agrees that nothing  shall  discharge or
satisfy  the  liability  of  Guarantor  hereunder  except the full  payment  and
performance of all of Borrower's  debts and obligations to Lender with interest.
Guarantor  waives  all  presentments,   demands  for  performance,   notices  of
nonperformance,  protests,  notices of protest, notices of dishonor,  notices of
default,  notices of  acceptance of this Guaranty and all other notices to which
Guarantors or any of them might  otherwise be entitled,  and the right to a jury
trial in any action  hereunder  or arising  out of  Lender's  transactions  with
Borrower.

         6. Guarantor agrees that it is its  responsibility  to keep informed of
the  financial  status of  Borrower  and of any  circumstance  which may  affect
Guarantor's  obligations or Borrower,  and Guarantor  recognizes and agrees that
Lender is not obligated to keep  Guarantor  informed of any such  circumstances.
Where Borrower is a corporation or partnership it is not necessary for Lender to
inquire into the powers of Borrower,  of the  officers,  directors,  partners or
agents acting or purporting to act on its behalf,  and any indebtedness  made or
created  in  reliance  upon  the  professed  exercise  of such  powers  shall be
guaranteed hereunder.

         7.  Guarantor  agrees to pay a reasonable  attorney's fee and all other
costs and expenses  which may be incurred by Lender in the  enforcement  of this
Guaranty or any claim hereunder or under any other instrument or guaranty.

         8. No termination or  modification  of this Guaranty shall be effective
for any  purpose  unless it is in writing  and  executed by an officer of Lender
authorized to do so.

         9. All acts and  transactions  hereunder and the rights and obligations
of  the  parties  hereto  shall  be  governed,  construed,  and  interpreted  in
accordance with the laws of the State of California.

         10.  Guarantor  shall  deliver,  or caused to be  delivered,  to Lender
audited year end financial statements, prepared by a certified public accounting
firm,  of  Guarantor  within 90 days of each fiscal year end and, if  reasonably
requested by Lender, more frequently (but in no event more than quarterly).

                                     FORM OF
                               EASEMENT AGREEMENT
                                    (ACCESS)


         This  Easement  Agreement is made this _____ day of  _________________,
1999, by and between FLATIRONS FUNDING, LIMITED PARTNERSHIP,  a Delaware limited
partnership  ("FFLP"),  ELECTRONIC  ARTS REDWOOD,  INC., a Delaware  corporation
("EAR"), and _____________________, a _____________________ ("Buyer").

         WHEREAS,  FFLP is the owner of certain real property located in Redwood
City, San Mateo County,  California,  more  particularly  described in Exhibit A
attached hereto, hereinafter referred to as the "Servient Tenement;" and

         WHEREAS,  EAR is the  lessee  of the  Servient  Tenement  and  adjacent
buildings; and

         WHEREAS,  Buyer is the owner of certain real  property  adjacent to the
Servient  Tenement,  more  particularly  described in Exhibit B attached hereto,
hereinafter referred to as the "Dominant Tenement;" and

         WHEREAS,  EAR as of the date hereof has sold the  Dominant  Tenement to
Buyer,  and one of the  conditions  of the sale is that FFLP grants the easement
described  herein  to  Buyer,  its  successors  and  assigns,  on the  terms and
conditions hereinafter set forth; and

         WHEREAS,  FFLP wishes to grant the  easement  and EAR  consents to such
grant;

         NOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed as follows:

         1. Grant of Easement.  FFLP hereby grants to Buyer,  its successors and
assigns, in perpetuity, as appurtenant to the Dominant Tenement, a non-exclusive
right-of-way  easement  as  described  in  Section  2 below  (the  "Right-of-Way
Easement").  Persons designated in Section 2 as entitled to use the Right-of-Way
Easement are collectively referred to as "Permittees."

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

         2.  Description of Right-Of-Way  Easement.  The  Right-of-Way  Easement
granted herein is a right-of-way for Buyer, its successors, assigns, and tenants
of the buildings  located or to be located on the Dominant  Tenement,  and their
respective employees,  agents,  visitors, and invitees, to cross that portion of
the Servient Tenement described in Exhibit C attached hereto en route to or from
the entrance to the buildings located or to be located on the Dominant Tenement.

         3. Maintenance,  Repair, and Replacement. FFLP shall be responsible for
the  maintenance,  repair,  and  replacement  of the right of way located on the
Servient Tenement.

                  (a)  Costs.  FFLP  shall be  responsible  for the cost of such
maintenance,  repair, or replacement;  provided,  however, that if any repair or
maintenance to the right of way is required by reason of the negligence, willful
misconduct or other fault of Buyer or its Permittees,  unless  otherwise  agreed
Buyer  shall  be  obligated  to pay  for the  entire  cost  of  such  repair  or
maintenance.  If FFLP  initially  pays the cost of such  maintenance  or repair,
Buyer shall remit  payment in full to FFLP within thirty (30) days from the date
of receipt of a written request for payment from FFLP. Nothing contained in this
Agreement  shall limit the right of Buyer to charge,  allocate,  pass through or
apportion all or any part of such expense to any Permittees of Buyer.

                  (b)  Access.  For  purposes  of  repairing,   maintaining,  or
replacing the right of way, FFLP shall have the right to temporarily  suspend or
block  use of or access to  portions  of the  Servient  Tenement  to the  extent
reasonably  necessary to undertake  such repairs or  maintenance,  without being
deemed  to be in  violation  of the  terms  and  conditions  of this  Agreement;
provided, however, that, except in an emergency, such work shall be performed at
times and in a manner  reasonably  convenient to the continued and uninterrupted
operation of the businesses located on the Dominant Tenement.

                  (c)  Reallocation  of  Obligations.   Maintenance  and  repair
obligations and costs may be reallocated  between the parties and/or  additional
or substitute  parties in the future by an amendment to this  Agreement  signed,
acknowledged and duly recorded by the parties.

         4. Damage and Destruction;  Eminent Domain.  In the event of any damage
to or destruction of all or any portion of the Servient Tenement, or a taking of
all or any portion of the  Servient  Tenement by power of eminent  domain,  FFLP
shall rebuild and restore the remainder, if any, of the Servient Tenement to the
extent possible.  In the event of a taking by power of eminent domain of part or
all of the Servient Tenement, the obligations of FFLP pursuant to this Agreement
shall  cease as of the date of the taking  with  respect  to the  portion of the
Servient Tenement so taken.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to give
Buyer any interest in any award or payment made to FFLP in  connection  with any
exercise of eminent domain or transfer in lieu thereof  affecting any portion of
the Servient Tenement.

         5.  Payment  of  Property  Taxes.  FFLP  shall  pay or cause to be paid
promptly  when  due  all  real  property  taxes  and  other  special  taxes  and
assessments  which may be levied or  assessed  against  the  Servient  Tenement;
provided,  however,  that in the event any real property  taxes or other special
taxes or assessments are separately  assessed or levied against Buyer's interest
under this Agreement,  Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid promptly when due all
such taxes or assessments.

                                      -2-

         6. Insurance.  Each of FFLP and Buyer shall provide, keep in force, and
maintain  commercial  general  liability  insurance with a reputable and solvent
insurance company covering their respective  interests in the Servient Tenement.
Such policies (a) shall insure against bodily injury,  death and property damage
with a combined  single limit of coverage of not less than Five Million  Dollars
($5,000,000);  (b) shall name the other party and EAR as an additional  insured;
and (c) shall be increased from time to time to amounts reasonable and customary
for similar  properties in the area where the Servient Tenement is located.  All
such policies  shall provide that the same shall not be canceled  without thirty
(30) days' prior written  notice to the named and additional  insureds.  Each of
FFLP and Buyer shall provide the other with  certificates of insurance on July 1
of each year and upon any renewal or replacement  of insurance  during the year.
If a party fails to procure the required  insurance,  the other party may obtain
such insurance in the defaulting  party's name and bill the defaulting party for
such costs.

         7. Indemnity.  Buyer shall indemnify,  defend and hold harmless against
all penalties, losses, liability and claims of any nature whatsoever, including,
without limitation,  claims or liabilities for loss or damage to property or for
injury to or death of persons, and all costs and attorneys' fees, arising out of
the activities of Buyer or its Permittees  upon or using the Servient  Tenement;
provided, however, that the foregoing indemnification shall not apply to matters
resulting  directly or indirectly  from the negligence or willful  misconduct of
FFLP or EAR, or their respective  successors,  assigns,  tenants,  visitors,  or
invitees.

         8. Default.  In the event a party hereunder breaches or defaults in its
obligations  hereunder,  the  other  party may sue for  damages  in the event of
failure to pay money or seek specific  performance  in the event of a failure to
maintain or repair.  Neither  party may block or inhibit  access to the Servient
Tenement as a result of a breach or default hereunder.

         9. EAR Consent and Assumption. FFLP hereby assigns and delegates all of
its duties and obligations  hereunder to EAR, its successors and assigns, for so
long as EAR, its  successors and assigns,  are tenants of the Servient  Tenement
under lease from FFLP or its successors or assigns.  EAR accepts such assignment
and delegation,  hereby consents to FFLP's  granting the within  easements,  and
hereby subordinates its leasehold interest to the within easements.

         10.  Mortgages.  No  breach  of this  Agreement  shall  defeat,  render
invalid,  diminish or impair the lien of any first  mortgage or deed of trust on
the  Servient  Tenement  made in good  faith and for value,  but the  covenants,
conditions and restrictions contained herein shall be binding upon and effective
against any mortgagee who acquires title to either of the Parcels or any portion
thereof  by  foreclosure,  trustee's  sale,  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure  or
otherwise,  pursuant  to a mortgage or deed of trust  created  after the date of
this Agreement.

         11. Entire  Agreement.  This instrument  contains the entire  agreement
between the parties  relating to the rights herein  granted and the  obligations
herein  assumed.  Any oral  representations  or  modifications  concerning  this
instrument shall be of no force or effect except in a subsequent modification in
writing, signed by the party to be charged.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

         12. Attorney's Fees. In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute
relating to this instrument or the breach thereof, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to recover from the losing party reasonable expenses,  attorney's fees,
and costs.

         13. Binding Effect. This instrument shall be binding on and shall inure
to the benefit of the heirs, executors, administrators,  successors, and assigns
of FFLP, EAR, and Buyer, and each of them.

         14. No Dedication.  Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to be a gift or dedication of any portion of the Servient Tenement to or for the
general public or for any public purposes whatsoever. It is the intention of the
parties that this  Agreement  shall be strictly  limited to and for the purposes
expressed herein.

         15. Covenants Running With the Land. All of the provisions, agreements,
rights,  powers,  covenants,   conditions  and  obligations  contained  in  this
Agreement  shall be  binding  upon and shall  inure to the  benefit of the FFLP,
Buyer,  EAR  and  their  respective  successors  (by  merger,  consolidation  or
otherwise),  assigns,  and  representatives,  and all other persons acquiring an
interest  in  all or  any  portion  of the  Servient  Tenement  or the  Dominant
Tenement.  All of the provisions of this Agreement  shall  constitute  covenants
running  with  the  land  and  equitable  servitudes  pursuant  to any  and  all
applicable laws.

         16. Estoppel Certificates.  Either FFLP, EAR, or Buyer may, at any time
and from time to time,  in  connection  with the sale,  transfer,  financing  or
refinancing  of its  Tenement,  deliver  a written  notice to the other  parties
requesting  that the other  parties  execute a certificate  certifying  that the
requesting  party is not in default in the performance of its obligations  under
this  Agreement or, if in default,  describing  therein the nature and amount of
any default.  Such  certificate  shall be executed and returned  within ten (10)
days following the receipt of the notice from the requesting party. Failure by a
party to execute and return the certificate within the specified period shall be
deemed an admission by such party that the  requesting  party is current and not
in default in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.  Any such
certificate may be relied upon by all transferees, mortgagees, and deed of trust
beneficiaries.

         17.  Certain  Obligations  of  FFLP  Non-Recourse.  FFLP's  obligations
hereunder are intended to be the  obligations of the limited  partnership and of
the  corporations  which are the managing  general partner and any other general
partner  thereof  only,  and no recourse for the payment of any amount due under
this  Easement  Agreement or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect
thereof,  shall be held against any limited partner of FFLP or any incorporator,
shareholder, officer, director or affiliate, as such, past, present or future of
such  corporate  managing  general  partner or other  general  partner or of any
corporate  limited  partner or of any successor  corporation  to such  corporate
managing  general  partner or other  general  partner or any  corporate  limited
partner of FFLP, or against any direct or indirect  parent  corporation  of such
corporate  managing  general  partner or other general partner or of any limited
partner  of FFLP or any other  subsidiary  or  affiliate  of any such  direct or
indirect  parent  corporation  or  any  incorporator,   shareholder  officer  or
director,  as  such,  past,  present  or  future,  of any such  parent  or other
subsidiary or affiliate,  it being understood that FFLP is a limited partnership
formed for the purpose of


                                      -4-

acquiring  and owning  property  including  the Servient  Tenement and acting as
lessor to Electronic Arts Redwood, Inc., on the express understanding aforesaid.

other documents  referred to herein,  of rights and remedies against the limited
partnership  or the  corporate  managing  general  partner or any other  general
partner  of FFLP or the  assets  of the  limited  partnership  or the  corporate
managing  general  partner or any other general partner of FFLP. As used in this

         binding obligation of the parties, and has not been modified or amended
         either  orally or in  writing  except by (i) that  First  Amendment  to

                REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Maxis, Inc.

         We  have   audited   the   consolidated   statements   of   operations,
stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows of Maxis, Inc. for the year ended
March 31, 1997 (not presented separately herein). These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present  fairly,  in all  material  respects,  the  consolidated  results of its
operations  and its cash flows for the year ended March 31, 1997,  in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                               ERNST & YOUNG LLP
