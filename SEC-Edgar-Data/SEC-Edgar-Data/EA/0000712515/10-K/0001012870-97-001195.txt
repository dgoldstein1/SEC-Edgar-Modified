ITEM 1:  BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

     Electronic Arts' predecessor was incorporated in California in 1982. In
September 1991, Electronic Arts was reincorporated under the laws of Delaware.
Unless otherwise indicated, the "Company" or "Electronic Arts," refers to
Electronic Arts Inc., a Delaware corporation, its California predecessor and its
wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. Electronic Arts' principal
executive offices are located at 1450 Fashion Island Boulevard, San Mateo,
California 94404. Its telephone number is (415) 571-7171.

     Electronic Arts creates, markets and distributes interactive entertainment
software for a variety of hardware platforms. As of March 31, 1997, the Company
marketed approximately 117 titles developed and/or published under one of its
brand names, including older titles marketed as "Classics" or "Publisher's
Choice." The Company also distributed approximately 51 additional titles
developed by other software publishers ("Affiliated Labels") in North America
and over 1,000 Affiliated Label titles in the rest of the world. As of March 31,
1997, the Company had developed 53 titles that had each generated life-to-date
net revenues in excess of $10,000,000. Since its inception, the Company has
developed products for 36 different computer hardware platforms, including the
following: IBM PC-CD and compatibles, Amiga, 8-bit Nintendo Entertainment System
(the "NES"), 16-bit Sega Genesis video game system (the "Genesis"), 16-bit Super
Nintendo Entertainment System (the "SNES"), Sega CD-ROM (Compact Disc-Read Only
Memory) peripheral device, Macintosh CD, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, the 
PlayStation ("PlayStation"), the Sega Saturn ("Saturn") and the Nintendo 64
("N64"). The Company's fiscal 1997 product releases were primarily for PC-CD and
32-bit video game platforms and to a lesser degree 16-bit and N64 cartridge
products. As of March 31, 1997, the Company was developing products for 5
different hardware platforms.

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
         The Company's product development methods and organization are modeled
on those used in the entertainment industry, and the Company markets its
products with techniques borrowed from other entertainment companies such as
record producers, magazine publishers and video distributors. Company employees
called "producers," who are each responsible for the development of one or more
products, oversee product development and direct teams comprised of both
Electronic Arts employees and outside contractors. Electronic Arts' designers
regularly work with celebrities and organizations in sports, entertainment and
other areas to develop products that provide gaming experiences that are as
realistic and interactive as possible. Celebrities and organizations with whom
the Company has had contracts include: FIFA, ROAD & TRACK, John Madden,
Shaquille O'Neal, the National Basketball Association, the PGA TOUR, the Pebble
Beach Company and the National Hockey League. The Company maintains development
studios in California, Canada, United Kingdom, Texas, Japan, Washington and
Maryland.

     The Company invests in the creation of state-of-the-art software tools and
utilities that are then used in product development. These tools allow for more
cost-effective product development and the ability to more efficiently convert
products from one hardware platform to another. The Company has also made
investments in new facilities and equipment to facilitate the creation and
editing of digital forms of video and audio recordings and product development
efforts for new hardware platforms.

     Additionally, the Company produces film, videotape and audio recordings to
include in its products. Two of the Company's subsidiaries, Electronic Arts
Productions Inc. (d/b/a Crocodile Productions) and Electronic Arts Productions
Ltd., have signed agreements with the Screen Actors Guild ("SAG") and American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists ("AFTRA") in the United States and
with British Actors Equity Association ("Equity") in the UK, respectively,
giving the Company access to a wide range of talent for use in Company-produced
film and video for inclusion in the Company's products. See Factors Affecting
                                                            -----------------

- ---------------------------------------

     Electronic Arts distributes its products and those of its Affiliated Labels
primarily by direct sales to retail chains and outlets in the United States and
Europe. In Japan and the South Asia Pacific region, the Company distributes
products both directly to retailers and through third party distributors. The
Company's products are available in over 52,000 retail locations worldwide. In
fiscal 1997, approximately 46% of the Company's net revenues were generated by
international operations, compared to 42% and 32% in fiscal 1996 and fiscal
1995, respectively.

INVESTMENTS AND JOINT VENTURES

         Acquisitions
         ------------

         On June 4, 1997, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to
merge with Maxis, Inc. ("Maxis"), a California-based interactive software
developer. Under the proposed transaction, approximately 4.1 million shares of
Electronic Arts' stock will be exchanged for all outstanding Maxis common stock.
The transaction, which is anticipated to be completed in the quarter ended
September 30, 1997, will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.

         Investments
         -----------

         The Company has made investments as part of its overall strategy and
currently holds minority equity interests in several companies, including
NovaLogic, Inc., Tiburon Entertainment, Firaxis Software, Inc., Stormfront
Studios, Mpath Interactive, Accolade, Inc. and The 3DO Company ("3DO"). See
Factors Affecting Future Performance - Investment In Affiliates at page 31.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

         Joint Ventures
         --------------

     The Company has a majority interest in a joint venture corporation,
Electronic Arts Victor Inc. ("EAV") for the development and distribution of
entertainment software products in Japan as well as certain Asian countries. See
Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item
8 hereof.

     The Company and Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. formed a joint venture company in
December 1994, Creative Wonders, LLC (formerly ABC/EA Home Software, LLC), to
develop and publish children's edutainment and interactive entertainment titles
as well as reference products. The Company currently distributes Creative
Wonders' products as one of the Company's Affiliated Labels. See Note 10 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.

MARKET

     Historically, no hardware platform or system has achieved long-term
dominance in the interactive entertainment market. This phenomenon has resulted
in the Company developing products at one time or another for 36 different
hardware platforms. Today, the competition in the market for hardware platforms
has intensified. In fiscal 1997, the hardware market completed the transition
from 16-bit video game platforms to next generation Sony and Sega 32-bit systems
and saw the introduction of the Nintendo 64-bit video game system. In addition,
the installed base of multimedia-enabled home computers has continued to grow as
prices have declined and the quality and choices of software have increased
dramatically . The Company develops and publishes products for multiple
platforms, and this diversification continues to be a cornerstone of the
Company's strategy.

     Early generation computer systems for which interactive software products
were published such as the Apple II and the Commodore 64 were 8-bit
floppy-disk-based personal computers. Several years ago these systems were
eclipsed by more powerful personal computer systems based on 16-bit
microprocessors, such as the IBM PC and compatibles, the Commodore Amiga and the
Apple Macintosh. Current computer systems utilize 32-bit microprocessor
technology and typically run CD-ROM based products.

     Video game systems have likewise changed significantly over time. In 1986
and 1987, Nintendo Co., Ltd. ("Nintendo") and Sega Enterprises, Ltd. ("Sega"),
respectively, introduced 8-bit video game systems that, compared to existing
general-purpose computer systems available at the time, were low in price, easy
to use and had more sophisticated audio-video capabilities. In late 1989, Sega
began shipping its Genesis system, a more powerful 16-bit video game system. In
August 1991, Nintendo introduced its 16-bit SNES video game system. In late
1992, Sega introduced the Sega CD-ROM drive as an add-on peripheral to its
Genesis system.

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
     The interactive software industry has recently undergone another
significant change due in part to the introduction of new hardware platforms, as
well as remote and electronic delivery systems. The new generation of systems
are based on 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors that incorporate dedicated
graphics chipsets. Many of these systems utilize CD-ROM drives. The Company
began development of 32-bit software products over five years ago by creating
the original software development system for the first of these advanced
products, the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer ("3DO"), which was introduced in
calendar year 1993. Sega and Sony each began distribution of their next
generation hardware systems (named the "Saturn" and "PlayStation," respectively)
in Japan during the quarter ended December 1994. Sega began limited shipment of
the Saturn in North America in May 1995 and Sony began shipping the PlayStation
in North America in September 1995.

     In June 1996, Nintendo shipped the N64 in Japan and subsequently introduced
the system in North America in September 1996. The N64 is a cartridge-based
video game platform which uses a 64-bit microprocessor. Additionally, Matsushita
is developing a next generation hardware system based on the 64-bit M2
technology licensed from 3DO.

     New entrants in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries,
such as cable television, telephone and diversified media and entertainment
companies, and a proliferation of new technologies, such as on-line networks and
the Internet may increase the competition in the markets in which the Company
competes. The Company's new product releases in its 1998 fiscal year will be
primarily for the IBM PC-CD and compatibles and 32-bit video game platforms,
including the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The Company is also
scheduled to release one N64 product and two on-line network gaming products
during fiscal 1998. See Factors Affecting Future Performance - The Industry and
                        -------------------------------------------------------
Competition at page 29.
- -----------

     The early investment in products for the 32-bit market, including both
Compact Disk personal computer ("PC-CD") and CD-dedicated video game ("CD-video
game") platforms, has been strategically important in positioning the Company
for the current generation of 32-bit machines. The Company believes that such
investment continues to be important and will continue aggressive development
activities for 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. Although the PlayStation has
achieved significant market acceptance in all geographical territories, there
can be no assurance that its growth will continue at the present rates,
particularly with the introduction of N64 by Nintendo. The introduction and
market acceptance of the N64, particularly in North America, may adversely
impact the growth rate of the 32-bit CD-video game platforms. While the Company
has a broad range of products available, the Company will not ship products for
the N64 in any significant quantities until calendar year 1998. In addition, the
Company's revenues and earnings are dependent on its ability to meet its product
release schedule and its failure to meet those schedules could result in
revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts' expectations for the fiscal
year, and in particular the first quarter of fiscal 1998. See Factors Affecting
                                                              -----------------

RELATIONSHIPS WITH SIGNIFICANT HARDWARE PLATFORM COMPANIES

     Sony
     ----

     In fiscal 1997, approximately 30% of the Company's net revenues were
derived from sales of software for the PlayStation compared to 9% in fiscal
1996. PlayStation products were first released during the second quarter of
fiscal 1996. During fiscal 1997, the Company released fourteen PlayStation games
compared to thirteen in fiscal 1996. Among these releases were Madden Football
                                                               ---------------
'97, Soviet Strike, NBA Live '97, FIFA Soccer '97 and NHL '97. The volume of
- ---  -------------  ------------  ---------------     -------
sales of PlayStation products significantly increased in fiscal 1997 due to the
increase in the installed base of PlayStation consoles worldwide and the quality
and timely release of the Company's key franchise titles. Although revenues from
the sales of PlayStation products in fiscal 1998 are expected to continue to
grow, the Company does not expect to maintain these growth rates. See Factors
                                                                      -------
Affecting Future Performance - Development at page 29.
- ------------------------------------------

     Under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with Sony Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, the
Company is authorized to develop and distribute CD-based software products
compatible with the PlayStation. Pursuant to the Sony Agreement, the
Company engages Sony to supply its PlayStation CDs for distribution by the
Company. Accordingly, the Company has limited ability to control its supply of
PlayStation CD products or the timing of their delivery. See Factors Affecting
                                                             -----------------
Future Performance - Hardware Companies at page 30.
- ---------------------------------------

     In connection with the Company's purchases of Sony products to be
distributed in Japan, Sony of Japan requires cash deposits totaling one-third of
the purchase orders. At March 31, 1997, EAV had no outstanding deposits to Sony.
EAV utilizes a line of credit to fund these deposits and other operating needs.
At March 31, 1997, EAV had an outstanding balance on this line of approximately
$4,024,000.

         Nintendo
         --------

     During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company released one product
for the N64, FIFA Soccer 64. In fiscal 1997, approximately 3% of the Company's
             --------------
net revenues were derived from the sale of N64 products. In March 1997, the
Company signed a licensing agreement with Nintendo (the "N64 Agreement") to
develop, publish and market certain sports products for the N64. Due to the
development time necessary for these products, the Company does not anticipate
shipping products for the N64 in any significant quantities until calendar year
1998.

                                       8
<PAGE>
 
     Under the terms of the N64 Agreement, the Company engages Nintendo to
manufacture its N64 cartridges for distribution by the Company. Accordingly, the
Company has limited ability to control its supply of N64 cartridges or the
timing of their delivery. A shortage of microchips or other factors outside the
control of the Company could impair the Company's ability to obtain an adequate
supply of cartridges.

     In fiscal 1997, approximately 4% of the Company's net revenues were derived
from sales of software for the SNES platform compared to 12% in fiscal 1996. The
volume of sales of SNES products declined in fiscal 1997 as the market made the
transition from 16-bit cartridge based video game platforms to next generation
32-bit systems. The Company released three SNES games in fiscal 1997 compared to
five games in fiscal 1996. These releases were Madden Football '97, NBA Live '97
                                               -------------------  ------------
and FIFA Soccer '97. The Company does not expect to release any new SNES titles
    ---------------
in fiscal 1998.

     Under the terms of its licensing agreement with Nintendo for SNES products,
the Company is authorized to develop, publish and market cartridge products for
the SNES. SNES cartridges distributed in North America and Europe are
manufactured by the Company in Puerto Rico. The Company is required to purchase
from Nintendo certain key components for production of these cartridges. A
shortage of these components or other factors outside the control of the Company
could impair the Company's ability to manufacture an adequate supply of
cartridges. The Company's SNES cartridges distributed in the rest of the world
are manufactured by Nintendo.

     In connection with the Company's purchases of N64 and SNES cartridges for
distribution in North America, Nintendo requires the Company to provide
irrevocable letters of credit prior to Nintendo's acceptance of purchase orders
from the company for purchases of these cartridges. For purchases of N64
cartridges for distribution in Japan and Europe, and for SNES cartridges
distributed outside of North America and Europe, Nintendo requires the Company
to make cash deposits. Furthermore, Nintendo maintains a policy of not
accepting returns of either N64 or SNES cartridges. Because of these and other
factors, the carrying of an inventory of cartridges entails significant capital
and risk. See Factors Affecting Future Performance - Hardware Companies at page

     Sega
     ----

     In the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, approximately 10% of the Company's
net revenue came from sales of Sega Genesis products compared to 26% in fiscal
1996. During fiscal 1997, the Company released six Genesis games compared to ten
in fiscal 1996. The volume of sales of Sega Genesis products declined
significantly in fiscal 1997 as the market made the transition from 16-bit
cartridge based video game platforms to next generation 32-bit systems. The
Company currently has planned only limited releases of Sega Genesis products in
fiscal 1998 and, accordingly, the volume of Genesis sales is expected to
continue to significantly decline in fiscal 1998.

     Under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with Sega in July
1992, as amended (the "16-bit Sega Agreement"), the Company is authorized to
develop and manufacture ROM-cartridge software products compatible with the Sega
Genesis system through December 1997 and to distribute those cartridges through
June 1998. Genesis cartridges are manufactured by the Company in Puerto Rico
under the 16-bit Sega Agreement. A shortage of components, or other factors
outside the control of the Company could impair the Company's ability to obtain
an adequate supply of cartridges.

     In the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997, approximately 6% of the Company's
net revenue came from sales of Saturn products compared to 2% in fiscal 1996.
During fiscal 1997, the Company released twelve Saturn products compared with
four in fiscal 1996. Among these releases were Madden Football '97, Need for
                                               -------------------  --------
Speed and NHL '97. During the third quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company had its
- -----     -------
initial release of products for the Saturn.

     Under the terms of a licensing agreement entered into with Sega in January
1995 (the "Sega Saturn Agreement"), the Company is authorized to develop and
distribute CD-based software products compatible with the Sega Saturn. Pursuant
to the Sega Saturn Agreement, the Company engages various third party
manufacturers approved by Sega to supply its Saturn CDs for distribution.
Accordingly, the Company has limited ability to control its supply of Saturn CD
products or the timing of their delivery.

PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

     In fiscal 1997, the Company generated approximately three quarters of its
revenues from products released during the year. See Factors Affecting Future
                                                     ------------------------
Performance - Products at page 29. As of March 31, 1997, the Company was
- ----------------------
actively marketing approximately 117 titles, comprising approximately 264 stock
keeping units ("sku's"), that were published by the Company's development
divisions and subsidiaries ("EA Studios"). During fiscal 1997, the Company
introduced over 31 EA Studios titles, representing over 63 sku's, compared to 22
EA Studio titles, comprising over 64 sku's, in fiscal 1996. From the inception
of the Company through March 31, 1997, the EA Studios organization had created
and published 53 titles that have each generated more than $10,000,000 in
life-to-date net revenues for the Company.

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
     The products published by EA Studios are designed and created by its
in-house designers and artists and by independent software developers
("independent artists"). The Company typically pays the independent artists
royalties based on the sales of the specific products, as defined in the related
independent artist agreements.

     For fiscal 1997, one title, Madden Football '97, published on five
                                 -------------------
platforms, represented 11% of the total 1997 net revenues. For fiscal 1996, the
Company had one title, FIFA Soccer '96, published on six platforms, which
                       ---------------
represented 11% of the total 1996 net revenues. No one title accounted for more
than 10% of the Company's net revenues for fiscal 1995.

     The Company publishes products in a number of categories such as sports,
action and interactive movies, strategy, simulations, role playing and
adventure, each of which is becoming increasingly competitive. The Company's
sports-related products, marketed under the EA Sports brand name, accounted for
a significant percentage of net revenues in fiscal years 1997 and 1996. There
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its market share
in the sports category. See Factors Affecting Future Performance - The
                            ------------------------------------------
Industry and Competition at page 29.
- ------------------------

     The front line retail selling prices in North America of the Company's
products, excluding older titles (marketed as "Classics" and "Publisher's
Choice"), typically range from $40.00 to $70.00. "Classics" and "Publisher's
Choice" titles have retail selling prices that range from $10.00 to $15.00. The
retail selling prices of EA titles outside of North America vary based on local
market conditions.

     The Company currently develops or publishes products for 5 different
hardware platforms and has from time to time developed and marketed products on
36 different and incompatible platforms in the past. In fiscal 1997, the Company
product introductions were predominantly for PC-CD, 32-bit video game platforms
and to a lesser degree 16-bit video game systems. The Company's planned product
introductions for fiscal 1998 are predominantly for PC-CD and 32-bit video game
systems. The Company will also release a limited number of products for the N64
and for on-line network play in fiscal 1998. See Factors Affecting Future
                                                 ------------------------
Performance - Development and Platform Changes, respectively, at page 29.
- -----------------------------------------------

     As compact discs have emerged as the preferred medium for interactive
entertainment, education, and information software, the Company continued its
investment in the development of CD-ROM tools and technologies in fiscal 1997
and currently has more than 37 products in development for new CD-ROM platforms,
including the IBM PC and compatibles, the PlayStation and the Saturn. Most of
these products will be convertible for use on multiple advanced hardware
systems. During the fiscal years 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Company had research
and development expenditures of $118.1 million, $99.6 million, and $73.9
million, respectively. See Factors Affecting Future Performance - Development at

     Additionally, the Company produces film and videotape to include in certain
products pursuant to agreements between certain of the company's subsidiaries
with SAG, AFTRA and Equity. With extensive use of video in some of the Company's
products, particularly its products in the interactive movie category, there can
be no assurance that the significantly higher sales levels required to make
these products profitable will be achieved. During fiscal 1997, the Company
released one product with significant video content and expects to release one
product with significant video content in fiscal 1998. In addition, the
Company's agreements with SAG and AFTRA expire in June 1997 and there can be no
assurances that the Company will be able to renegotiate favorable terms. See
Factors Affecting Future Performance - Film and Videotape at page 30.
- ---------------------------------------------------------

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

     The Company distributes both EA Studio products and products developed and
published by other software publishers known as "Affiliated Labels."

     In most cases, Affiliated Label products are delivered to the Company as
completed products. As of March 31, 1997, the Company distributed 51 Affiliated
Label titles in North America and over 1,000 Affiliated Label titles in the
rest of the world. No single Affiliated Label has accounted for more than 10%
of the Company's net revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.

     During fiscal 1997, the Company entered into a one year agreement with
Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment outside of North America and multi-year
agreements with Accolade, Inc. and DreamWorks Interactive in North America for
distribution of their products. Additionally, a significant affiliate was
acquired and discontinued distribution through the Company in the second quarter
of fiscal 1997.

     The Company generated approximately 87% of its North American net revenues
from direct sales through a field sales organization of professionals and a
group of telephone sales representatives. The remaining 13% of its North
American sales were made through a limited number of specialized and regional
distributors and rack jobbers in markets where the Company believes direct sales
would not be economical. The Company had no customers accounting for more than
10% of total net revenues for the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.

     As discussed above, (See Market above) the video game business has become
                              ------
increasingly "hits" driven, requiring significantly greater expenditures for
advertising, particularly for television advertising. There can be no assurance
that the Company will continue to produce "hit" products or that advertising
expenditures will increase sales sufficiently to recoup the advertising
expenditures.

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
     The Company has stock-balancing programs for its personal computer products
that, under certain circumstances and up to a specified amount, allow for the
exchange of personal computer products by resellers. The Company also typically
provides for price protection for its personal computer and video game system
products that, under certain conditions, allows the reseller a price reduction
from the Company for unsold products. The Company maintains a policy of
exchanging products or giving credits, but does not give cash refunds. Moreover,
the risk of product returns may increase as new hardware platforms become more
popular or market factors force the Company to make changes in its distribution
system. The Company monitors and manages the volume of its sales to retailers
and distributors and their inventories as substantial overstocking in the
distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for
substantial price protection in subsequent periods. The Company believes that it
provides adequate reserves for returns and price protection which are based on
estimated future returns of products, taking into account promotional
activities, the timing of new product introductions, distributor and retailer
inventories of the Company's products and other factors, and that its current
reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection requirements for
current in-channel inventory. However, there can be no assurance that actual
returns or price protection will not exceed the Company's reserves. See Factors
                                                                        -------
Affecting Future Performance - Revenues and Expenses at page 30.
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company also has a fulfillment group that sells product directly to
consumers through a toll-free number listed in advertising by the Company and
its Affiliated Labels. This group is also responsible for targeted direct mail
marketing and sells product upgrades, backups and accessories to registered
customers.

     The distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold
have been characterized by change, including consolidations and financial
difficulties of certain distributors and retailers and the emergence of new
retailers such as general mass merchandisers. The development of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render Electronic Arts'
accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible, which could have an adverse
effect on the operating results and financial condition of the Company. In the
quarter ended September 1996, the Company recorded $2,300,000 in bad debt
expenses related to potentially uncollectible receivables from a customer who
filed for bankruptcy. In addition, an increasing number of companies are
competing for access to these channels. Electronic Arts' arrangements with its
distributors and retailers may be terminated by either party at any time without
cause. Distributors and retailers often carry products that compete with those
of the Company. Retailers of Electronic Arts' products typically have a limited
amount of shelf space and promotional resources for which there is intense
competition. There can be no assurance that distributors and retailers will
continue to purchase Electronic Arts' products or provide Electronic Arts'
products with adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

     The Company has wholly owned subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, France,
Spain, Germany, Australia, Canada, South Africa, Singapore, Sweden and Puerto
Rico as well as a majority owned subsidiary in Japan. The amounts of net
revenues, operating profit and identifiable assets attributable to each of the
Company's geographic regions for each of the last three fiscal years are set
forth in Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included
in Item 8 hereof. International net revenues increased by 28% to $289,239,000,
or 46% of consolidated 1997 net revenues, compared to $225,658,000, or 42% of
the 1996 total. The increase in international revenues was due to higher
worldwide sales of 32-bit CD-video game products and increased sales of PC-CD
and Affiliated Label products in Europe and South Asia Pacific. This was
partially offset by a decrease in 16-bit video game cartridge products. In
fiscal 1997, the Company continued its strategy to expand into emerging world
markets by opening offices in Malaysia, Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan and Holland as
well as expanding its European distribution.

     In fiscal 1997, net revenues from Europe increased by 42% to $223,930,000
compared to $157,999,000 in fiscal 1996. The increase in Europe was mainly
attributable to the expansion of distribution in the United Kingdom as well as
higher revenues generated by Kingsoft GmbH, EA France and the full year of
operations of EA Nordic and EA South Africa. The increase was due mainly to an
increase in net revenues derived from higher volume of PlayStation and PC-CD
products and Affiliated Label products offset by a decrease in 16-bit products.
The increase in European Affiliated Label revenues was, in part, due to a new
distribution agreement with Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment.

     In fiscal 1997, Japan net revenues decreased by 19% to $37,237,000 compared
to $45,865,000 in fiscal 1996. The decrease in sales in Japan is attributable to
the soft demand for PC products and the delay in the introduction of products
relevant to the Japanese market. The decrease was partially offset by increased
sales of 32-bit products and a title for the N64. In fiscal 1997, net revenues
from South Asia Pacific increased by 29% to $28,072,000 compared to $21,794,000
in fiscal 1996. The increase in net revenues was due mainly to sales in new
markets, including China, Taiwan and New Zealand.

     Though international revenues are expected to grow in fiscal 1998,
international revenues may not grow at as high a rate as in prior years.

MANUFACTURING

     The Company's Genesis and SNES cartridge products are manufactured by the
Company in Puerto Rico under the terms of a manufacturing license agreement with
Sega and Nintendo, respectively. A portion of the Company's personal computer
CD-ROM products are also manufactured in Puerto Rico. The assembly of the final
packaged product is performed by outside organizations under the supervision of
the Company's operations organization. The manufacturing process for all
software involves the duplication of software code onto ROM chips, or CD,
printing of packaging and documentation, and assembly of the final packaged
product. Quality control tests are performed on all products by Company
employees, and the products are then warehoused and shipped to customers by the
Company.

     In many instances, the Company is able to acquire materials on a
volume-discount basis. The Company has multiple potential sources of supply for
most materials. Except with respect to its PlayStation and N64 products, the
Company also has alternate sources for the manufacture and assembly of most of
its products. To date, the Company has not experienced any material difficulties
or delays in production of its software and related documentation and packaging.
However, a shortage of components or other factors beyond the control of the
Company could impair the Company's ability to manufacture, or have manufactured,
its products. See Factors Affecting Future Performance - Hardware Companies at
page 30.          ---------------------------------------------------------

BACKLOG

     The Company normally ships product within a few days after receipt of an
order. However, a backlog may occur for EA Studios and Affiliated Label products
that have been announced for release but not yet shipped. The Company does not
consider backlog to be an indicator of future performance.

SEASONALITY

     The Company's business is highly seasonal. The Company typically
experiences its highest revenues and profits in the calendar year-end holiday
season and a seasonal low in revenues and profits in the quarter ending in June.
In its 1998 fiscal year, and particularly in the June and September quarters,
the Company expects these seasonal trends to be magnified by general economic
and industry factors.

EMPLOYEES

     As of March 31, 1997, the Company employed approximately 1,700 people, of
whom over 900 were outside the United States. The Company believes that its
ability to attract and retain qualified employees is an important factor in its
growth and development and that its future success will depend, in large
measure, on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees.
To date, the Company has been successful in recruiting and retaining sufficient
numbers of qualified personnel to conduct its business successfully. See Factors
                                                                         -------

ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES

     The Company's principal administrative, sales and marketing, research and
development, and support facility is located in four modern buildings in San
Mateo, California, 15 miles south of San Francisco. The Company presently
occupies approximately 196,000 sq. ft. in these buildings, under leases that
expire at various times between August 1998 and April 1999.

     In addition, the Company leases and occupies a 54,000 sq. ft. facility used
as an office and warehouse in Hayward, California, and a 84,000 sq. ft.
warehouse facility in Louisville, Kentucky. The Company also occupies sales
offices in the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Chicago, Dallas and New York. The
Company also has a manufacturing facility in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

     The Company's North American research and development activities are
supported by a 86,000 sq. ft. development facility in Burnaby, British
Columbia, Canada and a 29,000 sq. ft. facility in Seattle, Washington. The
Company also owns a 180,000 sq. ft. development facility in Austin, Texas and
leases a 5,000 sq. ft. development facility in Baltimore, Maryland.

     The Company's United Kingdom subsidiary occupies administrative, sales, and
distribution facilities in Langley, England, under a long-term lease for a total
of 66,000 sq. ft. and a 22,000 sq. ft. development facility in Surrey, England.
In Europe, the Company also leases two administrative, sales and distribution
facilities in Germany, as well as sales and distribution facilities in Madrid,
Spain, Lyon, France, Stockholm, Sweden and Johannesberg, South Africa.

     In Asia and the South Pacific, the Company maintains a 5,500 sq. ft. sales
and distribution facility in Brisbane, Australia. The Company also has sales and
distribution facilities in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and New Zealand, and
representative offices in Beijing and Shanghai, China. The Company also
maintains a 27,000 sq. ft. sales and development office in Tokyo, Japan. See
Notes 3 and 8 to Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item
8 hereof.

     In February 1995, the Company entered into a master operating lease for
land and buildings to be constructed in Redwood City, California. The facility
is to be used as a corporate headquarters for EA. The above mentioned rental
space EA currently occupies in San Mateo, California is expected to be vacated
upon the completion of the new corporate headquarters. The square footage of the
new facilities is expected to be approximately 375,000. The Company expects
completion of these facilities in fiscal 1999.

     The Company believes that these facilities are adequate for its current
needs. The Company believes that suitable additional or substitute space will be
available as needed to accommodate the Company's future needs.

ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The Company is subject to a number of routine pending litigation matters.
Management, after review and consultation with counsel, considers that any
liability from the disposition of such matters would not have a material adverse
effect upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Company.


ITEM 4:  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     There were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the

ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

The following "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition of
Results of Operations", contains forward looking statements regarding Electronic
Arts' ("the Company" or "EA") future performance that involve certain risks
including those discussed in "Factors Affecting Future Performance" at pages ___
of this Annual Report and under the same heading in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 1997. Future results of the Company
may differ materially from any forward looking statement due to such risks.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 1997 to 1996

                            1997                1996           % change
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net revenues          $624,766,000       $531,887,000            17.5
- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company derives revenues from shipments of EA Studio Compact Disk ("CD")
products for dedicated entertainment systems ("CD-video game"), EA Studio CD
personal computer products ("PC-CD") (primarily entertainment software), EA
Studio cartridge products, licensing of EA Studio products, distribution of EA
Studio products through hardware companies ("OEMs") and shipments of Affiliated
Label CD products that are created by third parties.

Total net revenues increased compared to the prior year due to an increase in
net revenues derived from a higher volume of CD-based products (CD-video games
and PC-CD), Affiliated Label products and a 64-bit video game cartridge product.
This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of 16-bit video game
cartridges.

Net revenues from 32-bit CD-video game products, including the PlayStation and
Saturn, were $223,693,000 in fiscal 1997, representing 36% of the total net
revenues compared to $76,523,000, or 14% of total net revenues in fiscal 1996.
The increase in sales of PlayStation and Saturn products was attributable to the
greater installed base of these 32-bit CD-video game consoles and more titles
published for these consoles by the Company.

Sales of PlayStation products in fiscal 1997 increased to $185,349,000, or 30%
of total revenue, compared to $50,491,000, or 9% of total revenue in fiscal
1996. The Company released 14 new PlayStation titles in fiscal 1997 compared to
13 in fiscal 1996.

Net revenues derived from the sales of other 32-bit products were $38,344,000
primarily from Saturn products in fiscal 1997 compared to $26,032,000, including
3DO and Saturn products, in fiscal 1996. The Company released 12 new Saturn
titles in fiscal 1997 compared to eight 3DO titles and four Saturn titles in
fiscal 1996. The Company produced no new games for 3DO in fiscal 1997 and does
not expect to release any new titles in fiscal 1998.

The Company expects revenues from 32-bit CD-video game products to continue to
grow in fiscal 1998, but as revenues for these products increase, the Company
does not expect to maintain these growth rates.

Net revenues from PC-CD products increased to $178,310,000 in fiscal 1997,
representing 29% of total net revenues, from $140,594,000, or 26% of total net
revenues in fiscal 1996. The Company released 25 PC-CD titles and two
supplemental data disks in fiscal 1997 compared to 22 titles in fiscal 1996. The
increase in sales of PC-CD products was attributable to the growth in the PC
market worldwide, growth in the sports category, the expansion of the Company's
direct distribution worldwide and more PC-CD titles published by the Company.

Net revenues generated by 16-bit video game cartridge-based products were
$89,160,000, or 14% of total revenues in fiscal 1997, compared to $202,599,000,
or 38% of net revenues in fiscal 1996. New generation 32-bit and 64-bit video
game consoles are replacing 16-bit video game systems. Accordingly, sales of
16-bit video game hardware and related software have significantly declined and
are expected to continue to do so in fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1997, the
Company released fewer titles for these platforms and does not expect to release
any new titles in fiscal 1998.

Sales of EA Studio Genesis cartridge products in fiscal 1997 declined to
$62,005,000, or 10% of total revenue, compared to $138,643,000, or 26% of total
revenue in fiscal 1996. The Company released six new Genesis titles in fiscal
1997 compared to 10 in fiscal 1996.

Net revenues derived from cartridge products for the Super Nintendo
Entertainment System ("Super NES") were $27,155,000, or 4% of total revenue, in
fiscal 1997 compared to $63,956,000, or 12% of total revenue in fiscal 1996. The
Company released three new titles for the Super NES in fiscal 1997 compared to
five in fiscal 1996.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated $22,095,000 in fiscal 1997, compared
to $27,018,000 in fiscal 1996. The decrease primarily resulted from lower volume
of distribution of the Company's products through OEMs in North America and
Japan.

Net revenues derived from N64 were $17,804,000. The Company released its first
N64 title during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.

                                       24
<PAGE>
 
Net revenues from shipments of Affiliated Label products in fiscal 1997
increased to $93,298,000 from $76,302,000 in fiscal 1996. The increase was due
to higher sales of Affiliated Label products in Europe and South Asia Pacific
related to an exclusive international distribution agreement with Twentieth
Century Fox Home Entertainment and other affiliates. This was partially offset
by a decrease in Affiliated Label net revenues in North America and Japan. The
decrease in North America was attributable to lower volume of revenue from two
exclusive distribution arrangements for certain PC entertainment and 3DO
products to key accounts on behalf of other third party publishers which began
in fiscal 1996 and the loss of a significant affiliate at the end of the second
quarter of fiscal 1997. The decrease in Japan was due to lower volume of sales
from existing affiliates.

The Company's revenues from floppy disk products, hand-held cartridge products
and products from the Sega 32X platform decreased to $406,000 in fiscal 1997
from $8,851,000 in fiscal 1996. Results reflect the now completed market shift
away from these products to CD-based products. The Company produced no new games
for these platforms in fiscal 1997 and does not expect to release any new titles
in fiscal 1998.

North American net revenues increased by 10% to $335,527,000 in fiscal 1997 as
compared to $306,229,000 in fiscal 1996. The increase was mainly attributable to
strong growth in 32-bit CD-video game and PC-CD systems partially offset by the
decline in 16-bit sales. Net revenues from sales of CD-video game and PC-CD
products increased $113,070,000 while sales of 16-bit cartridge products
decreased $82,493,000 in comparison to the prior year.

International net revenues increased by 28% to $289,239,000, or 46% of
consolidated 1997 net revenues, compared to $225,658,000, or 42% of the 1996
total. The increase in international revenues was due to higher worldwide sales
of 32-bit CD-video game products and increased sales of PC-CD and Affiliated
Label products in Europe and South Asia Pacific. This was partially offset by a
decrease in 16-bit video game cartridge products.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 1997 reflects lower
product costs associated with CD-based products offset by higher professional,
celebrity and manufacturing royalties, higher distribution and manufacturing
expenses for the operations in Europe and North America and growth in the lower
margin distribution business.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The increase in marketing and sales expense was due to higher television
advertising expenses and higher co-op advertising expenses associated with
higher revenues. Additionally, marketing and sales expenses, along with general
and administrative expenses, increased due to additional headcount and higher
facility expenses related to the opening of new sales offices in international
markets. Increases in general and administrative expenses were also due to
implementation related costs for new management information systems in North
America and Europe. The increase in research and development expenses was
primarily due to higher average development costs for CD-based products than for
cartridge products and higher depreciation expense. The Company released a total
of 63 new products in fiscal 1997 compared to 64 in fiscal 1996. Total CD-based
new products released for fiscal 1997 were 53 compared to 47 in fiscal 1996.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 1996 to 1995

                                  1996                1995             % change
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net revenues                   $531,887,000       $493,346,000             7.8
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total fiscal 1996 net revenues increased compared to fiscal 1995 primarily due
to increased net revenues derived from a higher volume of CD-based products
(PC-CD and CD-video games), and Affiliated Label products. This was partially
offset by decreased sales of 16-bit Sega Genesis video game cartridges
("Genesis") and EA floppy disk products.

Net revenues generated by 16-bit video game cartridge-based products were
$202,599,000, or 38% of consolidated net revenues in fiscal 1996, compared to
$281,933,000, or 57% of net revenues in fiscal 1995. The mix of net revenue in
fiscal 1996 reflected the continued impact of the transition from the mature
16-bit cartridge-based market to the emerging CD- based market. As the 16-bit
market matured, sales of hardware and software declined. During fiscal 1996, the
Company released fewer titles for these platforms as compared to fiscal 1995.

Sales of EA Studio Genesis cartridge products in fiscal 1996 declined to
$138,643,000, or 26% of total revenue, compared to $213,471,000, or 43% of total
revenue in fiscal 1995. The Company released 10 new Genesis titles in fiscal
1996 compared to 17 in fiscal 1995.

Net revenues derived from cartridge products for the Super Nintendo
Entertainment System were $63,956,000, or 12% of total revenue, in fiscal 1996
compared to $68,462,000, or 14% of total revenue in fiscal 1995. The Company
released five new titles for the Super NES in fiscal 1996 compared to six in
fiscal 1995.

Net revenues from PC-CD products increased to $140,594,000 in fiscal 1996,
representing 26% of total net revenues, from $72,227,000, or 15% of total net
revenues in fiscal 1995. The Company released 22 PC-CD titles in fiscal 1996
compared to 30 in fiscal 1995.

CD-video game products, primarily the PlayStation in fiscal 1996 and the 3DO
Interactive Multiplayer in fiscal 1995, generated net revenues of $76,523,000 in
fiscal 1996, representing 14% of the total net revenues, compared to
$27,230,000, or 6% of total net revenues in fiscal 1995. The Company released 25
CD-video game titles in fiscal 1996 compared to eight in fiscal 1995.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated $27,018,000 in fiscal 1996, compared
to $21,001,000 in fiscal 1995. The increase primarily resulted from increased
distribution of EA's products through OEMs.

Net revenues from shipments of Affiliated Label products in fiscal 1996
increased to $76,302,000 from $48,480,000 in fiscal 1995. The increase was
primarily attributable to revenues from the exclusive distribution of certain PC
entertainment and 3DO products to key accounts on behalf of other third party
publishers which began in fiscal 1996. Additionally, the Company had increased
Affiliated Label net revenues in Japan and Europe due to higher sales from
several new and existing affiliates. Affiliated Label CD-based products
represented 96% of total Affiliated Label net revenues in fiscal 1996, compared
to 59% in fiscal 1995.

The Company's revenues from floppy disk products, hand-held cartridge products
and products from the Sega 32X platform decreased to $8,851,000, or 2% of the
total in 1996, from $42,475,000, or 9% in fiscal 1995. Results continued to
reflect the rapid market shift away from these products to CD-based products.
The Company produced no new games for 

                                       26
<PAGE>
 
these platforms in fiscal 1996 compared to 14 floppy disk titles in fiscal 1995.

International net revenues increased by 43% to $225,658,000, or 42% of
consolidated 1996 net revenues, compared to $158,043,000, or 32% of the 1995
total. The increase in international revenues was attributable to higher
worldwide sales of CD-based products, primarily PC-CD and PlayStation together
with an increase in sales of Super NES products in Europe, which were licensed
in 1995. This was partially offset by a decrease in floppy disk and Genesis
products.

North American net revenues totaled $306,229,000 in fiscal 1996, representing a
decrease of 9% over the $335,303,000 generated in fiscal 1995. The decrease was
attributable to the decline in 16-bit cartridge revenues partially offset by the
increase in shipments of PC-CD products and CD-video games.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 1996 reflected lower
product costs associated with CD-based products offset by higher production
costs for multimedia releases, higher professional and celebrity royalties,
higher distribution and manufacturing expenses for the operations in Europe and
growth in the lower margin distribution business.

As a percentage of net revenues        18.7%             15.0%
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The increase in marketing and sales expenses was affected by higher trade show
expenses and higher co-op advertising expenses associated with higher revenues.
Additionally, marketing and sales expenses, along with general and
administrative expenses, increased due to additional headcount and higher
facility expenses related to the prior year acquisitions and the opening of new
sales offices in international markets. The increase in general and
administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expenses
in Japan as compared to fiscal 1995.

The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to
additional headcount relating to increased in-house development capacity, higher
average development costs for CD-based products than for cartridge products,
increased reserves against artist advances due to product delays, primarily on
CD-video game platforms, and the acquisition of Manley & Associates, a Seattle-
based development company in 1996. The Company released a total of 64 new
products in fiscal 1996 compared to 86 in fiscal 1995.

As a percentage of net revenues       1.1%              2.7%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The decrease in other income was primarily due to a one-time payment of
$10,000,000 from Broderbund Software, Inc. ("Broderbund"), offset by costs of
$1,400,000 incurred by the Company, associated with the termination of the
merger agreement between the Company and Broderbund in fiscal 1995.

In fiscal 1996, the Company also had higher interest income related to higher
average cash balances and interest rates worldwide together with gains on the
sales of marketable securities and fixed assets. These gains were substantially
offset by losses and write-offs of certain investments in affiliates.

Effective tax rate                    31.5%             32.0%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The effective tax rate for fiscal 1996 decreased over the prior year primarily
as a result of the fiscal 1995 impact of the operating loss reported by EAV and
the use of those losses to offset EAV's profits in 1996. Tax benefits from the
Company's Puerto Rico operations were lower in the current year as a result of
lower sales of cartridge products.

net gain of approximately $5,800,000 from the one-time payment of a merger
termination fee.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of March 31, 1997, the Company's working capital was $241,613,000 compared to
$199,713,000 at March 31, 1996. Cash and short-term investments increased by
approximately $82,113,000 in fiscal 1997. The Company generated $80,641,000 of
cash from operations in fiscal 1997. In addition, $20,205,000 was provided
through the sale of equity securities under the Company's employee stock plans.

     Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from $27,569,000 at
March 31, 1996 to $35,486,000 at March 31, 1997. Reserves have been charged for
returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in
prior periods. Management believes these reserves are adequate based on
historical experience and its current estimate of potential returns and
allowances.

     During fiscal 1997 the Company invested approximately $36,000,000 primarily
in computer hardware and software purchases required to support the Company's
development efforts and new management information systems worldwide.

     In connection with the Company's purchases of Sony products to be
distributed in Japan, Sony of Japan requires cash deposits totaling one-third of
purchase orders. Additionally, Nintendo of Japan requires cash deposits on all
orders of N64 cartridge products. EAV utilizes lines of credit to fund these
deposits for purchases of Sony and Nintendo products and for other operating
requirements. At March 31, 1997, EAV had approximately $4,024,000 outstanding on
this line.

     The Company's principal source of liquidity is $230,096,000 in cash and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements for the foreseeable
future.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANY DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS AND ARE SUBJECT
TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. SOME OF THOSE IMPORTANT RISKS AND
UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS TO VARY OR WHICH
MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT EA'S OPERATING RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:


THE INDUSTRY AND COMPETITION. The interactive software business has historically
been a volatile and highly dynamic industry affected by changing technology,
limited hardware platform life cycles, hit products, competition, component
supplies, seasonality, consumer spending and other economic trends. The business
is also intensely competitive. A variety of companies offer products that
compete directly with one or more of the Company's products. These direct
competitors vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial,
managerial and technical resources comparable to or greater than those of the
Company. Typically, the Company's chief competitor on dedicated game platforms
is the hardware manufacturer/licensor itself, to which the Company must pay
royalties, and in the case of Sony and Nintendo, manufacturing charges. For
example, Sony has aggressively launched sports product lines that directly
compete with the Company's sports products on the PlayStation. In addition,
competition for creative talent has intensified, and the attraction and
retention of key personnel by the Company is increasingly difficult. 

PRODUCTS. Interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans
of only 3 to 12 months. In addition, the market is crowded with a large number
of titles competing for limited shelf space at retail. The Company's future
success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce new
competitive products on a timely basis and to get those products distributed
widely at retail. To compete successfully, new products must adapt to new
hardware platforms and emerging industry standards, provide additional
functionality and be successfully distributed in numerous changing worldwide
markets. If the Company were unable, due to resource constraints or
technological or other reasons, to successfully develop and distribute such
products in a timely manner, this inability would have a material adverse effect
on its operating results and financial condition.

DEVELOPMENT. Product development schedules, particularly for new hardware
platforms and high-end multimedia PCs are difficult to predict because they
involve creative processes, use of new development tools for new platforms and
the learning process, research and experimentation associated with development
for new technologies. CD-ROM products frequently include more content and are
more complex, time-consuming and costly to develop than 16-bit cartridge
products and, accordingly, cause additional development and scheduling risk. For
example, in fiscal year 1996 Madden Football 96 and NHL Hockey 96 for the
                             ------------------     -------------
PlayStation did not ship at all due to significant delays in development that
made the delayed completion date untimely for these products. Likewise, Need for
                                                                        --------
Speed II for PC-CD, a high margin product scheduled for shipment in March of
- --------
1997, did not ship until April of 1997 due to last minute development delays.
Dungeon Keeper, originally scheduled to ship in the quarter ended June 1996, is
- --------------
now expected to ship during the summer of 1997. In addition, development risks
for CD-ROM products can cause particular difficulties in predicting quarterly
results because brief manufacturing lead times allow finalizing products and
projected release dates late in a quarter. Manufacturing lead times during the
year for CD-based products have been as brief as one to three weeks; cartridge
products more typically have had a six to twelve week lead time for
manufacture.

PLATFORM CHANGES. A large portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the
sale of products designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms such
as the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega
Genesis and the N64. The interdependent nature of the Company's business and
that of its hardware licensors brings significant risks to the Company's
business. The success of the Company's products is significantly affected by
market acceptance of the new video game hardware systems and the life span of
older hardware platforms, and the Company's ability to accurately predict these
factors with respect to each platform. In many cases, the Company will have
expended a large amount of development and marketing resources on products
designed for new video game systems (such as the new 32-bit systems) that have
not yet achieved large installed bases or will have continued product
development for older hardware platforms that may have shorter life cycles
than the Company expected. Conversely, if the Company does not choose to
develop for a platform that achieves significant market acceptance, or
discontinues development for a platform that has a longer life cycle than
expected, the Company's revenue growth may be adversely affected. For example,
the Company signed an agreement with Nintendo to develop and publish a line of
EA SPORTS products for the N64 in March of 1997, nearly seven months after
introduction of that platform in North America. Due to long development times
associated with this platform, the Company will not ship N64 products in
significant quantities until calendar year 1998.

The Company believes that investment in products for the 32-bit market,
including both PC-CD and CD-video game platforms (particularly the PlayStation)
has been strategically important in positioning the Company for the now
completed transition to 32 bit machines. The Company continues to believe that
such investment is important and will continue its aggressive development
activities for 32 bit platforms. Although the PlayStation has achieved
significant market acceptance in all geographic territories, there can be no
assurance that its growth will continue at the present rates, particularly with
the introduction of the N64 by Nintendo. The introduction and market acceptance
of the N64, particularly in North America, may adversely affect the growth rate
of the 32-bit CD-platforms. While the Company has a broad range of products
available and under development for the PlayStation and for PC-CD, the Company
will not ship products for the N64 in any significant quantities until calendar
year 1998.

                                       29
<PAGE>
 
HARDWARE COMPANIES. The Company's contracts with hardware licensors, which are
also some of the Company's chief competitors, often grant significant control to
the licensor over the manufacturing of the Company's products. This fact could,
in certain circumstances, leave the Company unable to get its products
manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events, control of the
manufacturing process by hardware companies increases both the manufacturing
lead times and the expense to the Company as compared to the lead times and
costs that the Company can achieve independently. In both fiscal 1996 and fiscal
1997, for example, the Company experienced delays in the manufacturing of
PlayStation products which caused delays in shipping those products. The results
of future periods may be affected by similar delays. Finally, the Company's
contracts with its hardware licensors often require the Company to take
significant risks in holding or prepaying for its inventory of products. In
particular, the Company's agreement with Nintendo for N64 products requires
prepayment of costly cartridge-based inventory, minimum orders and no rights of
return.

REVENUE AND EXPENSES. A substantial majority of the revenue of the Company in
any quarter typically results from orders received in that quarter and products
introduced in that quarter. The Company's expenses are based, in part, on
development of products to be released in the future. Certain overhead and
product development expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues. This
trend is increasing as the Company increases the proportion of products
developed internally. As a result, the Company's quarterly results of operations
are difficult to predict, and small delays in product deliveries may cause
quarterly revenues, operating results and net income to fall significantly below
anticipated levels. The Company typically receives orders shortly before
shipments, making backlog an unreliable indicator of quarterly results. A
shortfall in shipments at the end of any particular quarter may cause the
results of that quarter to fall significantly short of anticipated levels.

FILM AND VIDEOTAPE. The Company produces film and videotape to include in
certain products pursuant to agreements between certain of the Company's
subsidiaries with SAG, AFTRA and Equity. However, the costs of video production
are significantly higher than for software production, and for products which
include a substantial amount of video such as certain interactive movies, the
costs of producing the video component is significantly higher than the cost of
developing the software component. Accordingly, more units of such products must
be sold to recoup the development and production costs. There can be no
assurance that these products which include significant film or videotape
components will be commercially successful enough to recoup development costs.
In addition, the Company's agreements with SAG and AFTRA expire during the
current calendar year, and there can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to renegotiate favorable terms.

GROSS MARGINS. Although gross margins for the Company's products as a whole have
increased over the last three fiscal years, there are no assurances that this
trend will continue in the future for several reasons. Professional and
celebrity royalties continue to increase. Also, while the costs of development
of new products for 32- and 64-bit systems have increased, overall costs of
goods are not declining. For products on platforms for which the Company is
required to purchase its goods from the hardware companies, the Company is
unable to achieve cost reductions through manufacturing efficiencies, and
royalties to hardware companies remain fixed or are increasing. As the Company
begins to ship N64 products in significant quantities, margins may further
decline due to the higher cost of goods associated with this cartridge-based
platform. Similarly, higher distribution expenses for operations in Europe and
North America and growth of the lower margin distribution business continue to
put pressure on margins. In addition, retailers continue to require significant
price protection for products, and with an increasing number of titles available
for advanced platforms, such requirements for price protection may increase.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. Both the video game and PC businesses have become
increasingly "hits" driven. Additional marketing and advertising funds are
required to drive and support "hit" products, particularly television
advertising. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to
produce "hit" titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

EMPLOYEES. Competition for employees in the interactive software business is
intense and increasing as competition in the industry increases. In the last
fiscal year, recruiting of the Company's employees generally, and its executive
officers in particular, has been intense. Large software and media companies
frequently offer significantly larger cash compensation than does the Company,
placing pressure on the Company's base salary and cash bonus compensation. Small
start-up companies such as those proliferating in the online business areas
offer significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature
companies like the Company to match without significant stockholder dilution.
While executive turnover has decreased in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal
1996, virtually all of the executives continue to experience intense recruiting
pressure. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to
attract and retain enough qualified employees in the future.

FOREIGN SALES AND CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. For the 1997 fiscal year, international
net revenues comprised 46% of total consolidated net revenues. The Company
expects foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing
portion of the Company's revenues. Such sales are subject to unexpected
regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales
are primarily made in local currencies which may fluctuate.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES. The Company has a number of equity investments in
affiliates, including small developers, such as Firaxis and Visual Concepts,
other publishers, such as NovaLogic, Inc. and Accolade, Inc., and new ventures
such as Mpath Interactive. 
 
These companies are generally small and without significant financial resources.
Financial difficulties for any of these companies could cause a reduction in the
value of the Company's investment. For example, in fiscal 1996 the Company wrote
off its investment in SportsLab in its entirety.

FLUCTUATIONS IN STOCK PRICE. Due to analysts' expectations of continued growth
and other factors, any shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's Common Stock in
any given period. As a result of the factors discussed in this annual report and
other factors that may arise in the future, the market price of the Company's
Common Stock historically has been, and may continue to be subject to
significant fluctuations over a short period of time. These fluctuations may be
due to factors specific to the Company, to changes in analysts' earnings
estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment, media
or electronics industries or the securities markets in general. For example,
during the fiscal years 1997 and 1996 the price per share of the Company's
common stock ranged from $24.75 to $39.13 and from $20.13 to $41.75,
respectively.

Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the
Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance
should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance, and
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in
future periods.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Electronic Arts Inc. and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts
Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 1997 and 1996 and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended March 31, 1997. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Electronic
Arts Inc. and subsidiaries at March 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended March 31, 1997, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

ELECTRONIC ARTS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995


(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Electronic Arts Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the
"Company") and its majority owned subsidiary Electronic Arts Victor, Inc. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

     A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company follows:

(a) Fiscal Year

The Company's fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week period that ends on the
Saturday nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
1997 and 1996 contain 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Since the results of an
additional week are not material, and for clarity of presentation herein, all
fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month end.

(b) Revenue Recognition

Product Sales: Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped. Subject to
certain limitations, the Company permits customers to obtain exchanges within
certain specified periods and provides price protection on certain unsold
merchandise. Revenue is reflected net of an allowance for returns and price
protection.

Software Licenses: For those agreements which provide the customers the right to
multiple copies in exchange for guaranteed amounts, revenue is recognized at
delivery of the product master or the first copy. Per copy royalties on sales
that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Revenue from the licensing of software was $22,095,000, $27,018,000, and
$21,001,000 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

(c) Cash and Investments

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with insignificant rate
risk and with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Short-term investments include securities with maturities greater than three
months and less than one year, except for certain investments with stated
maturities greater than one year. Long-term investments consist of securities
with maturities greater than one year.

The Company accounts for investments under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities, ("SFAS 115"). The Company's policy is to protect the value of its
investment portfolio and to minimize principal risk by earning returns based on
current interest rates. The Company has classified short-term investments as
"available-for-sale" and applicable investments are stated at fair value which
approximates cost. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific
identification method.

(d) Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties represent prepayments made to independent software developers
under development agreements. Prepaid royalties are expensed at the contractual
royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on actual net product sales. Management
evaluates the future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly, and charges to
research and development expense any amounts that management deems unlikely to
be amortized at the contract royalty rate through product sales. Royalty
advances are classified as current and noncurrent assets based upon estimated
net product sales within the next year.

(e) Software Development Costs

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86 provides for the
capitalization of certain software development costs once technological
feasibility is established. The capitalized costs are then amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated product life, or on the ratio of current
revenues to total projected product revenues, whichever is greater. No software
development costs have been capitalized to date as the impact on the financial
statements for all periods presented is immaterial.

(f) Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories at March 31,
1997 and 1996 consisted of:

================================================================================
                                                     1997           1996
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                        (in thousands)
Raw materials and work in process                 $  3,706        $  2,160
Finished goods                                      12,141          12,544
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   $15,847         $14,704
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(g) Outside Production Costs

The Company defers the outside production costs of the film content of its
products. Such costs are expensed as cost of goods sold based on actual net
product sales. Film costs deferred as of March 31, 1997 and 1996 were $926,000
and $5,500,000, respectively.

(h) Advertising costs

The Company generally expenses advertising costs as incurred, except for
production costs associated with media campaigns which are deferred and charged
to expense at the first run of the ad. Cooperative advertising with distributors
and retailers is accrued when revenue is recognized. Cooperative advertising
credits are reimbursed when qualifying claims are submitted. For the fiscal
years ended 

                                       37
<PAGE>
 
March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, advertising expenses totaled approximately
$34,263,000, $28,437,000 and $28,065,000, respectively.

(i) Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation of furniture and
equipment is computed using the declining balance method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets, which range from three to seven years.
Depreciation on new management information systems is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
which range from four to seven years. Buildings are being depreciated using the
straight line method over 20 years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is
computed using the declining balance method over the lesser of the lease terms
or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

(j) Intangible Assets

Intangible assets net of amortization at March 31, 1997 and 1996 of $1,115,000,
and $1,752,000, respectively, are included in other current and noncurrent
assets and include costs of obtaining product technology and noncompete
covenants which are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of
their estimated useful lives or the agreement terms, typically no more than five
years. Intangibles also include goodwill resulting from the purchase of DROSoft
(now known as EA Spain) in November 1994 and Vision Software in March 1996.
Amortization expense for fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was
$654,000, $740,000, and $337,000, respectively.

(k)  Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on reported earnings before income taxes. Deferred
income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and
liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts
recognized for tax purposes.

(l) Foreign Currency Translation

For each of the Company's foreign subsidiaries the functional currency is its
local currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S. dollars using current exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are
translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The effects of
foreign currency translation adjustments are deferred and included as a
component of stockholders' equity.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency. Included in interest and other income in the statements of
income are foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of ($1,024,000),
$433,000, and $785,000, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and
1995, respectively.

(m)   Net Income Per Share

Net income per share is based on the weighted average number of common stock and
common stock equivalents from stock options outstanding during the period. There
is no significant difference between primary and fully diluted earnings per
share.

(n)  Employee Benefits

The Company has a 401(k) Plan covering substantially all of its U.S. employees.
The 401(k) Plan permits the Company to make discretionary contributions to
employees' accounts based on the Company's financial performance. The Company
contributed $405,000 and $279,000 to the Plan in fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996,
respectively.

(o)  Stock-based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based awards to employees using the intrinsic
value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25").

(p)  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No.
121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
Assets to Be Disposed Of" ("SFAS 121") effective for the fiscal year ended March
31, 1997. SFAS 121 requires that impairment losses be recorded on long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles when indicators of impairment are
present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated by those assets are less than
the assets' carrying amounts. Adoption of this standard did not have a material
impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation"
("SFAS 123") effective for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1997. SFAS 123
establishes a fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation plans. As allowed under provisions of SFAS 123, the Company has
chosen to continue the intrinsic value based method for stock-based employee
compensation plans and provide pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings
per share as if the accounting provisions of SFAS 123 had been adopted. As the
Company has elected to adopt only disclosure requirements of SFAS 123, such
adoption had no effect on the Company's consolidated net income or cash flows.

In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 128,
"Earnings per Share." SFAS No. 128 requires dual presentation of basic earnings
per share ("EPS") and diluted EPS on the face of all statements of earnings
issued after December 15, 1997, for all entities with complex capital
structures.

Basic EPS is computed as net earnings divided by the weighted-average number of
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential
dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through stock-based
compensation including stock options, restricted stock awards, warrants, and
other convertible securities using the treasury stock method. The Company does
not anticipate the effect of the provisions of this new standard on earnings per
share to be material.

                                       38
<PAGE>
 
(q) Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such
estimates include provisions for doubtful accounts, sales returns and
allowances, warranty provisions, and estimates regarding the recoverability of
prepaid royalty advances and inventory. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(r) Reclassifications

Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 1997 presentation.

Long-term investments                         $24,200        $  24,200
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-term investments are in the form of commercial notes with maturities of
five to eight years secured by U.S. Treasury Notes. Such investments enable the
Company to take advantage of certain tax incentives in its Puerto Rico operation
and are treated as held to maturity for financial reporting purposes.

(b)  Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are comprised of equity securities. The Company has
accounted for investments in equity securities as "available-for-sale" and has
stated applicable investments at fair value, with net unrealized appreciation
reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Marketable securities
had an aggregate cost of $1,559,000 and $14,123,000 at March 31, 1997 and 1996,
respectively. At March 31, 1997, marketable securities included gross unrealized
gains of $4,174,000 and gross unrealized losses of $185,000. At March 31, 1996
marketable securities included gross unrealized gains of $27,334,000 and gross
unrealized losses of $3,588,000.

At March 31, 1997, marketable securities included the Company's approximate 7%
ownership interest in The 3DO Company ("3DO"). During fiscal 1997, the Company
sold 1,220,000 shares of 3DO reducing its ownership interest to 2,013,668
shares. At March 31, 1996, the Company's ownership interest was approximately
12% of the outstanding shares of 3DO.

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996, the fair value of 3DO stock
and other securities sold was $21,152,000 and $9,783,000, respectively. The
gross realized gains from these sales totaled $8,393,000 and $9,112,000 for
fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively. There were no gains or losses from sales of
marketable securities during 1995. The gain on sale of investments is based on
the specific identification method.

(c) Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts

The Company utilizes foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge
foreign currency market exposures of underlying assets, liabilities and other
obligations. The Company does not use forward exchange contracts for speculative
or trading purposes. The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are
based on the Company's designation of such instruments as hedging transactions.
The criteria the Company uses for designating an instrument as a hedge include
the instrument's effectiveness in risk reduction and one-to-one matching of
forward exchange contracts to underlying transactions. Gains and losses on
currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of
anticipated transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained, are
deferred and recognized in income in the same period that the underlying
transactions are settled. Gains and losses on currency forward contracts that
are designated and effective as hedges of existing transactions are recognized
in income in the same period as losses and gains on the underlying transactions
are recognized and generally offset. Gains and losses on any instruments not
meeting the above criteria would be recognized in income in the current period.
The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies, including European
currencies. During fiscal 1997, the Company established hedging programs to
protect against exposure on certain intercompany receivables that are
denominated in foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward
exchange contracts. At March 31, 1997, the Company had foreign exchange
contracts, all having maturities of 90 days or less, to purchase and sell
approximately $27,549,000 in foreign currencies, primarily German Deutschmarks
and British Pounds.

The difference between the face value and market value of these contracts is not
significant. The counterparties to these contracts are substantial and credit
worthy multinational commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance
associated with these contracts are not considered to be material.

                                       39
<PAGE>
 
(3)  COMMITMENTS

Lease Obligations

The Company leases its current facilities and certain equipment under
non-cancelable operating lease agreements. The Company is required to pay
property taxes, insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of its
facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these
expenses on the remainder of the Company's facilities.

In February 1995, the Company entered into a master operating lease for land and
a building to be constructed in Redwood City, California. The initial term of
the lease is for a period of three years from the earlier of the date of
completion of construction or December 1998. Monthly lease payments are based
upon the London Interbank Offered Rate. The Company has the option to purchase
the property for the unamortized financed balance at any time after the
non-cancelable lease term, or it may terminate the lease at any time after the
non-cancelable term by arranging a third party sale or by making a termination
payment. Should the Company elect to terminate the lease, it will guarantee a
residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized value of the property. As part of
the agreement, the Company must also comply with certain financial covenants.

Total future minimum lease commitments as of March 31, 1997 are:

=============================================================

2002                                                  1,132
Thereafter                                            9,509
- -------------------------------------------------------------
                                                    $33,561
- -------------------------------------------------------------

Total rent expense for all operating leases was $10,158,000, $7,631,000, and
$6,451,000, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

The current portion of deferred rent of $599,000 and $823,000 at March 31, 1997
and 1996, respectively, represents the obligation accrued for rent, calculated
on the straight-line method over the lease term and is included in accrued
liabilities.


(4) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company extends credit to various companies in the retail and mass
merchandising industry. Collection of trade receivables may be affected by
changes in economic or other industry conditions and may, accordingly, impact
the Company's overall credit risk. Although the Company generally does not
require collateral, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers and reserves for potential credit losses are maintained.

The Company had no sales to any one customer in excess of 10% of total net
revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995.

Short-term investments are placed with high credit-quality financial
institutions or in short-duration high quality securities. The Company limits
the amount of credit exposure in any one institution or type of investment
instrument.


(5) LITIGATION

The Company is subject to pending claims and litigation. Management, after
review and consultation with counsel, considers that any liability from the
disposition of such lawsuits would not have a material adverse effect upon the
consolidated financial condition of the Company.


(6) PREFERRED STOCK

At March 31, 1997 and 1996, the Company had 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock
authorized but unissued. The rights, preferences, and restrictions of the
Preferred Stock may be designated by the Board of Directors without further
action by the Company's stockholders.


(7) STOCK PLANS

(a) Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan whereby eligible employees may
authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation to purchase
shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the
date of commencement of the offering or on the last day of the six-month
purchase period. The Plan commenced in September 1991. In fiscal 1997, 184,596
shares were purchased by the Company and distributed to employees at prices
ranging from $21.25 to $25.18. In fiscal 1996, 154,516 shares were purchased by
the Company and distributed to employees at prices ranging from $15.09 to
$21.57. In fiscal 1995, 169,187 shares were purchased by the Company and
distributed to employees at prices ranging from $15.09 to $15.51 per share. The
weighted average fair value of the fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996 awards was
$10.413 and $8.813, respectively. At March 1997, the Company had 228,638 shares
of its Common Stock reserved for future issuance under the Plan.

(b) Stock Option Plans

The Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan and Directors' Plan ("Option Plans")
provide stock options for employees, officers and independent contractors, and
for directors, respectively. Pursuant to these Option Plans, the Board of
Directors may grant non-qualified and incentive stock options to employees and
officers and non-qualified options to independent contractors, and directors, at
not less than the fair market value on the date of grant.

The options generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are generally
exercisable in monthly increments over 50 months.

                                       40
<PAGE>
 
SFAS 123 requires the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share
had the Company adopted the fair value method as of the beginning of fiscal
1996. Under SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-based awards to employees is
calculated through the use of options pricing models. These models were
developed to estimate the fair value of freely tradable, fully transferable
options without vesting restrictions, which characteristics significantly differ
from those of the Company's stock option awards. These models also require
subjective assumptions, including future stock price volatility and expected
time to exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The following weighted-average assumptions
used for grants made in 1997 and 1996 under the stock plans: risk-free interest
rates of 5.48% to 6.36% in 1997 and 5.12% to 6.25% in 1996; expected volatility
of 58% for both years; expected lives in both years of 2.42 years under the
Option Plans and one year for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. No dividends are
assumed in the expected term. The Company's calculations are based on a multiple
option valuation approach and forfeitures are recognized when they occur. Had
compensation cost for the Company's stock-based plans been determined on the
fair value at the grant date for awards consistent with the method of SFAS 123,
the Company's pro forma net income and net income per share for fiscal 1997 and
1996 would have been $39,805,000 ($0.73 per share) and $33,959,000 ($0.63 per
share) in fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively.

Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options granted subsequent to March 31,
1995, the impact of non-vested stock options granted prior to this date has been
excluded from the pro forma calculation. Accordingly, the fiscal 1997 and 1996
pro forma adjustments are not indicative of future period pro forma adjustments
as the pro forma effect will not be fully reflected until subsequent years.

The valuation allowance relates solely to the foreign loss and foreign credit
carryforwards, for which the utilization is uncertain in future periods.

     At March 31, 1997, the Company had no net operating loss carryforwards for
Federal or State income tax purposes.

     The differences between the statutory income tax rate and the Company's
effective tax rate, expressed as a percentage of income before provision for
income taxes, for the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 were as follows:

The Company does not provide for U.S. taxes on undistributed earnings of its
foreign subsidiaries. At March 31, 1997, the undistributed foreign earnings of
the foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $76,000,000. If these
earnings were distributed to the parent company, foreign tax credits available
under current law would substantially eliminate the resulting Federal tax
liability.

     The Company's manufacturing subsidiary in Puerto Rico operates under a
Puerto Rican tax incentive program which grants the Company certain percentage
exemptions from Puerto Rican income, property and municipal taxes for a period
of 20 years from the date of the commencement of operations. The U.S. tax
benefit derived for the years ended March 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995 was
approximately $600,000, $411,000, and $3,886,000, respectively. Long-term
reinvestment in Puerto Rico of the undistributed earnings of the Puerto Rico
subsidiary enables the Company to take advantage of certain tax incentives. In
addition, the Company has been granted an amendment to expand its exemption for
certain additional operations.

(13) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED
LIABILITIES - the carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES - fair value is based on quoted market prices.


(14) SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On June 4, 1997, the Company entered into an agreement to merge with Maxis, Inc.
("Maxis"), a California-based interactive software developer. Under the proposed
transaction, approximately 4.1 million shares of Electronic Arts' stock will be
exchanged for all outstanding Maxis common stock. The transaction, which is
anticipated to be completed in the quarter ended September 30, 1997, will be
accounted for as a pooling of interests.

                     ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

                  DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT'S FISCAL YEAR 1998
                              EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN



Target annual bonuses are set for each executive based upon a percentage of
salary.  Bonuses are paid in six parts, five of which relate only to the
Company's earnings results: one part measured against the Company's performance
in each fiscal quarter for a total of four parts, and one part measured against
the Company's performance for the fiscal year.  The sixth part is discretionary
and is measured against each individual executive's contributions.   Bonuses are
paid quarterly for the prior quarter, and after the end of the fiscal year for
those portions based on fiscal year performance and individual contributions.
If profits in any period are less than 90% of plan, no bonus based on the
Company's performance is paid for that period.  If profits exceed plan by up to
20% during a period, the bonus rate is doubled for the incremental profits above
plan.  If profits exceed plan by more than 20%, the bonus rate is tripled for
profits in excess of 120% of plan.

                         AMENDED AND RESTATED GUARANTY
                         ----------------------------- 


          AMENDED AND RESTATED GUARANTY, dated as of March 7, 1997 (the
"Guaranty"), from ELECTRONIC ARTS INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Guarantor"), to FLATIRONS FUNDING, LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited
partnership (the "Lessor").


                              W I T N E S S E T H:
                              - - - - - - - - - - 


          WHEREAS, the Guarantor and the Lessor entered into a Guaranty dated as
of February 14, 1995 (the "Original Guaranty") pursuant to which the Guarantor
guaranteed to the Lessor the due and punctual payment and performance by
Electronic Arts Redwood, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Guarantor (the "Guaranteed Subsidiary"), of its obligations
under a certain Agreement for Lease (the "Agreement for Lease") and a certain
Lease Agreement (the "Master Lease") both dated as of February 14, 1995; and

          WHEREAS, the Lessor and the Guaranteed Subsidiary propose to enter
into an amended and restated Agreement for Lease, (the "Amended and Restated
Agreement for Lease") and an amendment to the Lease Agreement (the "Master Lease
Amendment") both dated as of the date hereof (the Amended and Restated Agreement
for Lease, as it may be further amended, restated, modified, supplemented or
extended from time to time, and the Master Lease, as amended by the Master Lease
Amendment and as it may be further amended, restated, modified, supplemented, or
extended from time to time, are collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Guaranteed Agreements"); and

          WHEREAS, the Lessor is unwilling to enter into the Amended and
Restated Agreement for Lease and the Master Lease Amendment with the Guaranteed
Subsidiary unless the Guarantor enters into this Amended and Restated Guaranty
amending and restating the Original Guaranty in its entirety.

          NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Original Guaranty is hereby amended and restated in its
entirety as follows:

          1.   Guaranty.  (a)  The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
               --------                                                
irrevocably guarantees to the Lessor the due and punctual performance of and
compliance by the Guaranteed Subsidiary with all obligations, covenants,
warranties, undertakings and conditions contained in or arising under the
Guaranteed Agreements, including, but not limited to, the full and punctual
payment by the Guaranteed Subsidiary, when due, whether at the stated due date,
by acceleration or otherwise, of any and all rent, obligations, liabilities,
indebtedness and other amounts of every kind arising out of the Guaranteed
Agreements, all amounts in respect of the indemnities provided for in the
Guaranteed Agreements, and all damages (whether provided for in the 


<PAGE>
 
Guaranteed Agreements or otherwise permitted by law) in respect of any failure
or refusal by the Guaranteed Subsidiary to make any such payment, howsoever
created, arising or evidenced, voluntary or involuntary, whether direct or
indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing or owing to the
Lessor (all the foregoing obligations and undertakings are collectively referred
to hereinafter as the "Obligations").

          (b)  This Guaranty is an absolute and unconditional guaranty of
performance and payment when due under the Guaranteed Agreements and not of
collection of any indebtedness contained in or arising under the Guaranteed
Agreements.  This Guaranty is in no way conditioned upon any attempt to collect
from the Guaranteed Subsidiary or upon any other event or contingency, and shall
be binding upon and enforceable against the Guarantor without regard to the
validity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Agreements or of any term thereof.
If for any reason the Guaranteed Subsidiary shall fail or be unable duly and
punctually to pay any such amount when due under the Guaranteed Agreements, the
Guarantor will forthwith pay, if not already paid by the Guaranteed Subsidiary,
the same immediately upon demand.

          (c)  In case either of the Guaranteed Agreements shall be terminated
as a result of the rejection thereof by any trustee, receiver or liquidating
agent of the Guaranteed Subsidiary or any of its properties in any bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation,
dissolution or similar proceeding, the Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall
continue to the same extent as if such agreement had not been so rejected. The
Guarantor agrees that this Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment to the Lessor of the
Obligations or any part thereof is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by
the Lessor upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Guaranteed
Subsidiary, or otherwise, as though such payment to the Lessor had not been
made.

          (d)  The Guarantor shall pay all reasonable costs, expenses and
damages incurred (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and
disbursements) in connection with the enforcement of (i) the Obligations to the
extent that such costs, expenses and damages are not paid by the Guaranteed
Subsidiary and (ii) the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.

          2.   Guaranty Continuing and Unlimited.  The obligations of the
               ---------------------------------                         
Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing and unlimited, shall not be subject to
any counterclaim, set-off, deduction or defense (other than payment or
performance) based upon any claim the Guarantor may have against the Lessor or
the Guaranteed Subsidiary or any other Person, and shall remain in full force
and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any
way affected by any circumstance or condition (whether or not the Guarantor
shall have any knowledge or notice thereof) whatsoever which might constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense including, but not limited to (a) any
express or implied amendment or modification of or supplement to the Guaranteed
Agreements or any other agreement referred to in either thereof, or any other
instrument applicable to the Guaranteed Subsidiary or to the Obligations, or any
part thereof, or any assignment or transfer of any thereof; (b) any failure on
the part of the Guaranteed Subsidiary to perform or comply with the Guaranteed
Agreements or any failure of any other Person to perform or comply with any term
of the Guaranteed Agreements, or any 

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
other agreement as aforesaid; (c) any waiver, consent, change, extension,
indulgence or other action or any action or inaction under or in respect of the
Guaranteed Agreements, or any other agreement as aforesaid, or this Guaranty,
whether or not the Lessor, the Guaranteed Subsidiary or the Guarantor has notice
or knowledge of any of the foregoing; (d) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar
proceeding with respect to the Guarantor or the Guaranteed Subsidiary, or their
respective properties or their creditors, or any action taken by any trustee or
receiver or by any court in any such proceeding; (e) any furnishing or
acceptance of additional security or any release of any security (and the
Guarantor authorizes the Lessor to furnish, accept or release said security);
(f) any limitation on the liability or Obligations of the Guaranteed Subsidiary
under the Guaranteed Agreements (other than any limitation expressly provided
for therein) or any termination, cancellation, frustration, invalidity or
unenforceability, in whole or in part, of the Guaranteed Agreements, or any term
of any thereof; (g) any lien, charge or encumbrance on or affecting the
Guarantor's or the Guaranteed Subsidiary's respective assets and properties; (h)
any act, omission or breach on the part of the Lessor under the Guaranteed
Agreements, or any other agreement at any time existing between the Lessor and
the Guaranteed Subsidiary or any other law, governmental regulation or other
agreement applicable to the Lessor or any Obligation; (i) any claim as a result
of any other dealings among the Lessor, the Guarantor or the Guaranteed
Subsidiary or any of them; (j) the assignment of the Guaranteed Agreements by
the Lessor to any other Person, or the assignment of this Guaranty by the Lessor
to any Person permitted under Section 6 of that certain Amended and Restated
Guarantor's Consent dated as of the date hereof among the Guarantor, the Lessor
and The Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Limited, New York Branch, as Collateral Agent; (k)
any change in the name of the Lessor, the Guaranteed Subsidiary or any other
person referred to herein; or (l) any failure by the Lessor to perfect or
continue the perfection of any lien or security interest in any collateral or
any failure by the Lessor to protect the property covered by any such lien or
security interest.

          The unconditional obligations of the Guarantor set forth herein
constitute the full recourse obligations of the Guarantor enforceable against it
to the full extent of all of its present and future income, assets and
properties.

          3.   Waiver.  The Guarantor unconditionally waives: (a) notice of any
               ------                                                          
of the matters referred to in Section 2 hereof; (b) all notices which may be
required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any rights against the
Guarantor hereunder, including, without limitation, notice of the acceptance of
this Guaranty, or the creation, renewal, extension, modification or accrual of
the Obligations or notice of any other matters relating thereto, any
presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, protest, nonpayment of any damages or
other amounts payable under the Guaranteed Agreements; (c) any requirement for
the enforcement, assertion or exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
under or in respect of the Guaranteed Agreements, including, without limitation,
diligence in collection or protection of or realization upon the Obligations or
any part thereof or any collateral therefor; (d) any requirement of diligence;
(e) any requirement to mitigate the damages resulting from a default by the
Guaranteed Subsidiary under the Guaranteed Agreements; (f) the occurrence of
every other condition precedent to which the Guarantor or the Guaranteed
Subsidiary may otherwise be entitled; (g) the right to require the Lessor to
proceed against the Guaranteed Subsidiary or any 

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
other Person liable on the Obligations, to proceed against or exhaust any
security held from the Guaranteed Subsidiary or any other Person, or to pursue
any other remedy in the Lessor's power whatsoever, and the Guarantor waives the
right to have the property of the Guaranteed Subsidiary first applied to the
discharge of the Obligations; and (h) the defense of any statute of limitations
affecting the enforcement of the Guaranty or the liability of the Guarantor, the
Guaranteed Subsidiary or any other Person liable on the Obligations.

          The Lessor may, at its election, exercise any right or remedy it may
have against the Guaranteed Subsidiary or any security held by the Lessor,
including, without limitation, the right to foreclose upon any such security by
judicial or nonjudicial sale, without affecting or impairing in any way the
liability of the Guarantor hereunder, except to the extent the Obligations have
been paid, and the Guarantor waives any defense arising out of the absence,
impairment or loss of any right of reimbursement, contribution or subrogation or
any other right or remedy of the Guarantor against the Guaranteed Subsidiary or
any such security, whether resulting from such election by the Lessor or
otherwise.

          The Guarantor understands that the liability of the Guaranteed
Subsidiary to the Lessor for the Obligations may be secured by real property and
that the Guarantor shall be liable for the full amount of its liability
hereunder notwithstanding foreclosure on such real property by trustee sale or
any other reason impairing the Guarantor's right to proceed against the
Guaranteed Subsidiary.  The Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that the
Guarantor may have because the Guaranteed Subsidiary's Obligations are secured
by real property.  This means, among other things: (a) the Lessor may collect
from the Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property
collateral pledged by the Guaranteed Subsidiary; and (b) if the Lessor
forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by the Guaranteed Subsidiary:
(i) the amount of the debt may be reduced only by the price for which that
collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more
than the sale price, and (ii) the Lessor may collect from the Guarantor even if
the Lessor, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any
right the Guarantor may have to collect from the Guaranteed Subsidiary.  This is
an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses the Guarantor
may have because the Guaranteed Subsidiary's Obligations are secured by real
property.  These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights
or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code
of Civil Procedure.

          The Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability
or other defense of the Guaranteed Subsidiary or by reason of the cessation from
any cause whatsoever of the liability, either in whole or in part, of the
Guaranteed Subsidiary to the Lessor for the Obligations.  The Guarantor hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, all rights and benefits under
Section 2809 of the California Civil Code purporting to reduce a guarantor's
obligations in proportion to the principal obligation, all rights and benefits
under Section 580a of the California Code of Civil Procedure governing
determination of fair market value following the exercise of power of sale, all
rights and benefits under Section 580b of the California Code of Civil Procedure
stating that no deficiency may be recovered on a real property purchase money
obligation, all rights and benefits under Section 580d of the California Code of
Civil Procedure stating that no deficiency may be recovered on a note secured by
a deed of trust on 

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
real property in case such real property is sold under the power of sale
contained in such deed of trust, and all rights and benefits under Section 726
of the California Code of Civil Procedure and any and all similar laws now in
effect or hereafter enacted in the State of California regarding the procedures
to be followed by a creditor with real property security and/or limiting the
right of such a creditor to a deficiency judgment, including, without
limitation, the California law now in effect stating that the Lessor must first
proceed against any real property collateral before commencing an action to
collect the Obligations, if such sections, or any of them, have any application
hereto or any application to the Guarantor. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing or any other provision hereof, the Guarantor irrevocably waives
any defense that the Guarantor may have under Section 580a of the California
Code of Civil Procedure including, without limitation, the requirement that (x)
the Lessor bring a lawsuit against the Guarantor under this Guaranty (if at all)
within three months after the date which the Lessor may hereafter elect to
complete a nonjudicial foreclosure sale (if any) under any deed of trust now or
hereafter securing the Obligations and (y) the Guarantor be credited with the
fair market value (as determined after court hearing) of any real property
encumbered by any such deed of trust which the Lessor may hereafter elect to
nonjudicially foreclose (if any). The Guarantor expressly waives any and all
benefits under the California Civil Code Sections 2808, 2810, 2819, 2821, 2839,
2845, 2848, 2849, 2850 and 2855.

          The Guarantor understands that the Lessor's exercise of certain rights
and remedies contained in the Guaranteed Agreements may affect or eliminate the
Guarantor's rights of subrogation against the Guaranteed Subsidiary and that the
Guarantor may therefore incur partially or totally nonreimbursable liability
hereunder; nevertheless, the Guarantor hereby authorizes and empowers the
Lessor, its successors, endorsees and/or assignees, to exercise in its or their
sole discretion, any rights and remedies, or any combination thereof, which may
then be available, it being the purpose and intent of the Guarantor that its
obligations hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any
and all circumstances.

          The Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping
informed of the financial condition of the Guaranteed Subsidiary and of all
other circumstances bearing upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations and
agrees that the Lessor shall not have any duty to advise the Guarantor of
information regarding any condition or circumstance or any change in such
condition or circumstance.  The Guarantor acknowledges that the Lessor has not
made any representation to the Guarantor concerning the financial condition of
the Guaranteed Subsidiary.

          4.   Representations and Warranties of the Guarantor.  The Guarantor
               -----------------------------------------------                
represents and warrants to the Lessor that:

          (a)  Corporate Existence.  The Guarantor (i) is duly organized, 
               -------------------                                       
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware,
(ii) has the corporate power, authority and legal right to own or operate its
properties or to lease the properties it operates and to conduct the business in
which it is currently engaged and (iii) is duly qualified as a foreign
corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its
ownership, lease or operation of properties or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where such failure to qualify would not have
a material adverse effect on the financial condition or business of Guarantor
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

          (b)  Corporate Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.  The
               -------------------------------------------------------      
Guarantor has the corporate power, authority and legal right to make, deliver
and perform this Guaranty and has taken all necessary corporate action to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty.  No consent
of any other Person (including, without limitation, stockholders and creditors
of the Guarantor), and no authorization of, notice to, or other act by any
governmental authority, agency or instrumentality is required in connection with
the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this
Guaranty.  This Guaranty has been duly executed and delivered on behalf of the
Guarantor and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms.

          (c)  No Legal Bar.  The execution, delivery and performance by the
               ------------                                                 
Guarantor of this Guaranty will not violate any provision of any law or
regulation applicable to the Guarantor or of any award, order or degree
applicable to the Guarantor of any court, arbitrator or governmental authority,
or of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws of the Guarantor, or of any
security issued by the Guarantor or of any material mortgage, indenture, lease,
contract or other agreement or undertaking to which the Guarantor is a party or
by which the Guarantor or any of its properties or assets may be bound.

          (d)  No Material Litigation.  There is no action, suit, proceeding or
               ----------------------                                          
investigation at law or in equity by or before any court, governmental body,
agency, commission or other tribunal now pending or, to the best knowledge of
Guarantor, threatened against or affecting the Guarantor or any of its property
or rights which questions the enforceability of this Guaranty or which, if
adversely determined, would have a material adverse impact on the financial
condition or business of the Guarantor and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or which, if adversely determined, would materially impair the ability of the
Guarantor to perform its obligations hereunder.

          (e)  Employee Benefit Plans.  Each Plan and, to the best knowledge of
               ----------------------                                          
the Guarantor, each Multiemployer Plan, has been administered in accordance with
its terms in all material respects and complies in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of law and regulations, and, to the extent
applicable, (i) no Reportable Event has occurred with respect to any Plan or, to
the best knowledge of the Guarantor, any Multiemployer Plan which would have a
materially adverse effect on the financial condition or business of the
Guarantor and its 

                                       6
<PAGE>
 
affiliates, taken as a whole; (ii) no steps have been taken to terminate any
Plan or to appoint a receiver to administer any Plan or, to the best knowledge
of the Guarantor, to terminate or appoint a receiver to administer any
Multiemployer Plan, and neither the Guarantor nor any of its affiliates has
withdrawn from any Multiemployer Plan or initiated steps to do so; (iii) there
is no Unfunded Vested Liability or withdrawal liability with respect to any Plan
or, to the best knowledge of the Guarantor, any Multiemployer Plan, that would
have, in the event of termination of such Plan or withdrawal from such
Multiemployer Plan, a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or
business of the Guarantor and its affiliates, taken as a whole; (iv) no
contribution failure has occurred with respect to any Plan sufficient to give
rise to a lien under Section 302(f) of the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974, as amended, and any regulations promulgated and rulings issued
thereunder ("ERISA"); and (v) no condition exists or event or transaction has
occurred with respect to any Plan or, to the best knowledge of the Guarantor,
any Multiemployer Plan, which could reasonably be expected to result in the
incurrence by the Guarantor or any of its affiliates of any material liability,
fine or penalty. For purposes of this Guaranty: (A) Plan shall mean an "employee
pension benefit plan", as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, which
is subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than a Multiemployer Plan) and to which
the Guarantor or any corporation, trade or business that is, at any relevant
time, required to be aggregated with the Guarantor, under Sections 414(b), (c),
(m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any regulations
promulgated and rulings issued thereunder (the "Code") or Section 4001 of ERISA,
may have any liability, including any liability by reason of having been a
substantial employer within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA, at any time
during the preceding five years, or by reason of being deemed to be a
contributing sponsor under Section 4069 of ERISA; (B) Multiemployer Plan shall
mean a plan described in Section 3(37) of ERISA and to which the Guarantor or
any corporation, trade or business that is, at any relevant time, required to be
aggregated with the Guarantor, under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) or of the
Code or Section 4001 of ERISA may have any liability; (C) Reportable Event shall
mean a "reportable event" as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA and the
regulations issued thereunder; and (D) Unfunded Vested Liability shall mean,
relative to any Plan, at any time, the excess (if any) of (I) the present value
of all vested nonforfeitable benefits under such Plan over (II) the fair market
value of all Plan assets allocable to such benefits, all determined as of the
then most recent valuation date for such Plan, but only to the extent that such
excess represents a potential liability of the Guarantor or any affiliate to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any successor thereto (the "PBGC") or
the Plan under Title IV of ERISA. Neither the Guarantor nor any entity required
(at any relevant time) to be aggregated with the Guarantor under Section 414(b),
(c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA has ever sponsored or
maintained, had any obligation to contribute to, had liability under or has
otherwise been a party to, any (i) "employee pension benefit plan" (as such term
is defined in ERISA) subject to Section 412 of the Code, Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA, or (ii) a "welfare plan" (as such term is
defined ERISA) that provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any
participant or beneficiary of a participant after such participant's termination
of employment except to the extent required by applicable law.

          (f)  Guaranteed Subsidiary.  The Guarantor owns and will continue to
               ---------------------                                          
own, directly or indirectly, not less than all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Guaranteed Subsidiary.  All such shares have been
validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and are free and clear of any
liens or encumbrances.

          (g)  Taxes.  The Guarantor and each of its subsidiaries has filed all
               -----                                                           
federal and other income tax returns and reports required by law to have been
filed by it and has paid all taxes and governmental charges thereby shown to be
owing, except any such taxes or charges which are being diligently contested in
good faith by appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles shall have been set
aside on its books.

          (h)  Compliance with Laws.  The Guarantor and each of its subsidiaries
               --------------------                                             
is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders of any
governmental authority (including, without limitation, all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and orders relating to environmental protection, the use and
disposal of hazardous substances and building and land use), except those the
non-compliance with which would not, either singly or in the aggregate,
materially adversely effect the financial condition or business of the Guarantor
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or impair the ability of the Guarantor to
perform its obligations hereunder.

          5.   Payments.  Each payment by the Guarantor to the Lessor under this
               --------                                                         
Guaranty shall be made by transferring the amount thereof to the Lessor or an
account designated by the Lessor in immediately available funds without set-off
or counterclaim.  The making of any payments by the Guarantor hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of any rights not waived pursuant hereto that the
Guarantor may have against the Lessor or the Guaranteed Subsidiary.

          6.   Parties.  This Guaranty shall inure to the benefit of the Lessor
               -------                                                         
and its successors, assigns or transferees, and shall be binding upon the
Guarantor and its successors and assigns.  The Guarantor may not delegate any of
its duties under this Guaranty without the prior written consent of the Lessor
or any Person to whom the Lessor has assigned this Guaranty.  Upon notice to the
Guarantor, the Lessor and its successors, assigns and transferees may assign its
or their rights and benefits under this Guaranty to any financial institution
providing financing to the Lessor in connection with the Guaranteed Agreements.

          7.   Notices.  All notices, demands and other communications between
               -------                                                        
the Lessor and the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be in writing and shall
be delivered or sent to the address or telecopier number shown below, or to such
other address or telecopier number as either party may by written notice to the
other have designated for such purpose.  Any such notice, demand or other
communication shall not be effective until actually received.

               1450 Fashion Island Boulevard

          8.   Remedies.  The Guarantor stipulates that the remedies at law in
               --------                                                       
respect of any default or threatened default by the Guarantor in the performance
of or compliance with any of the terms of this Guaranty are not and will not be
adequate, and that any of such terms may be specifically enforced by a decree
for specific performance or by an injunction against violation of any such terms
or otherwise.

          9.   Rights to Deal with the Guaranteed Subsidiary.  At any time and
               ---------------------------------------------                  
from time to time, without terminating, affecting or impairing the validity of
this Guaranty or the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder, the Lessor may deal
with the Guaranteed Subsidiary in the same manner and as fully as if this
Guaranty did not exist and shall be entitled, among other 

                                        9
<PAGE>
 
things, to grant the Guaranteed Subsidiary, without notice or demand and without
affecting the Guarantor's liability hereunder, such extension or extensions of
time to perform, renew, compromise, accelerate or otherwise change the time for
payment of or otherwise change the terms of payment or any part thereof
contained in or arising under the Guaranteed Agreements, or to waive any
Obligation of the Guaranteed Subsidiary to perform, any act or acts as the

Agent shall prepare and execute an AFL Unit Leasing Record with respect to such
Unit and deliver it to Owner at least seven (7) Business Days prior to the

Agent to execute and deliver an AFL Unit Leasing Record with respect to such
Unit prior to the applicable Designated Effective Date shall constitute an Event

event any Unit is made subject to the Lease prior to achieving Substantial
Completion, Owner's obligation to make further advances with respect to such
Unit under this Agreement shall continue until the Unit Completion Date for such
Unit, subject to Agent's satisfaction of the conditions precedent to such
advances contained in this Agreement. Owner, within five (5) Business Days of
receipt of a request for an advance and subject to satisfaction of the
conditions for such advance contained in this Agreement, shall execute and
deliver to Agent the revised AFL Unit Leasing Record for such Unit reflecting
the amount of such advance, and Agent, within five (5) Business Days of receipt

subsection 3.1 hereof, Agent may, by delivering to Owner a Certificate of
Increased Cost, at any time up to three (3) months after the Final Advance has
been made with respect to a Unit, request a Completion Advance in order to pay

sum due hereunder or for damages may be brought by Owner from time to time at
Owner's election, and nothing herein contained shall be deemed to require Owner
to await the date whereon this Agreement or the term hereof would have expired
by limitation had there been no such default by Agent or no such termination or

knowledge of any breach of this Agreement by Agent or of any default by Agent in

Obligations, Owner shall be entitled to recover from Agent, as liquidated
damages, and not as a penalty, an amount equal to the Unit Acquisition Cost of
any Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, Unit FF&E or Unit so sold, minus the
proceeds of such sale received by Owner. Proceeds of sale received by Owner in
excess of the Unit Acquisition Cost of such Unit Premises, Unit Improvements,
Unit FF&E or Unit sold shall be credited against the Accrued Default Obligations
Agent is required to pay under this subsection 11.2. If such proceeds exceed the
Accrued Default Obligations, or, if Agent has paid all amounts required to be
paid under this subsection 11.2, such excess shall be paid by Owner to Agent. As
an alternative to any such sale, or if Agent converts any Unit Premises, Unit
Improvements, Unit FF&E

paragraph, Owner shall transfer all of Owner's right, title and interest in and
to the Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, Unit FF&E and Unit to Agent.

by Owner of the amounts payable hereunder, Owner shall transfer all of Owner's
right, title and interest in and to the Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, Unit
FF&E and Unit to Agent or a purchaser other than Agent, as the case may be.

          No remedy referred to in this subsection 11.2 is intended to be
exclusive, but each shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy
referred to above or otherwise available to Owner at law or in equity, and the
exercise in whole or in part by Owner of any one or more of such remedies shall
not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise by Owner of any or all such
other remedies.  No waiver by Owner of any Event of Default hereunder shall in
any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any future or subsequent Event of
Default.

          With respect to the termination of this Agreement as to any Unit
Premises, Unit Improvements, Unit FF&E, or Unit as a result of an Event of
Default, Agent hereby waives service of any notice of intention to re-enter.

Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, Unit FF&E, or Unit or to reinstate this
Agreement as permitted or provided by or under any statute, law or decision now
or hereafter in force and effect.

     to Agent's negligence or willful misconduct, Agent shall have obtained
     reinstatement or reissuance of such Permit within thirty (30) days after
     the revocation or expiration thereof, or if such reinstatement or
     reissuance is of a nature that it cannot be completely effected within

     thereunder, to be observed or performed, unless any such observance or
     performance shall have been waived or not required by the landlord under
     such Ground Lease, or if any one or more of the events referred to in such
     Ground Lease shall occur which would cause such Ground Lease to terminate
     without notice or action by the landlord thereunder or which would entitle
     the landlord under such Ground Lease to terminate such Ground Lease and the
     term thereof by the giving of notice to Owner without opportunity to cure,
     as tenant thereunder, or if any Ground Lease shall be terminated or
     canceled for any reason or under any circumstance whatsoever, or if any of

     action by any Person or authority having the power of eminent domain (such
     events collectively referred to as a "Taking") and such Taking relates to
     all or a substantial portion of a Unit. Upon receipt of proceeds from any
     award or sale made in connection with such Taking, so long as no Event of
     Default or Potential Default has occurred and is continuing, and so long as
     Agent has made all payments to Owner required under subsection 11.4 hereof,
     Owner shall remit to Agent the net amount of such proceeds remaining after
     reimbursement for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
     reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Owner in connection with the
     negotiation and settlement of any proceedings related to such Taking. If
     such proceeds are received prior to Agent making the payments required
     under subsection 11.4 hereof, the net proceeds shall be applied to the
     amount payable thereunder. A Taking shall be deemed "to affect a
     substantial portion" of a Unit if after such Taking such Unit is, or will
     be, unusable for Agent's ordinary business purposes.

               ---------------------------------                            
     determine that the Available Commitment is not, or will not be, sufficient
     to allow Owner to make advances for completion of the Unit Improvements and
     acquisition and installation of Unit FF&E in accordance with the Unit
     Budget.

          (l)  Fundamental Change.  If a "Change of Control Event" (as described

     below) of the Guarantor shall occur.  For purposes of this paragraph (1) of
     subsection 11.3, a "Change of Control Event" shall occur on the earlier of
     any date on which the Guarantor shall (i) announce its intention to
     consummate, (ii) shall enter into an agreement to consummate or (iii) shall
     consummate, any transaction which does or would, if consummated, violate
     paragraph (b) of Section 26 of the Lease.

          (m)  Material Adverse Change Event.  If a "Material Adverse Change
               -----------------------------                                
     Event" (as described below) shall occur.  For purposes of this paragraph
     (m) of subsection 11.3, a "Material Adverse Change Event" shall mean a
     change in the condition (financial or otherwise) or business of the
     Guarantor which could reasonably be expected to cause the Guarantor's
     Tangible Net Worth to be reduced by 50% or more from that reflected in the
     Guarantor's most recent audited financial statements delivered to the
     Lessor pursuant to paragraph (b) of subsection 9.6 hereof, other than any
     such reduction caused by a change in accounting principles mandated by the
     Financial Accounting Standards Board, and excluding any write-off of
     intangibles; provided, that it can be reasonably expected that the
                  --------                                             
     impairment which relates to the write-off of such intangibles will be
     mitigated within two years.

     Designated Effective Date with respect to any Unit, an AFL Unit Leasing
     Record with respect to such Unit has not been executed and delivered to
     Owner for any reason, whether or not as a result of Agent's inability to
     satisfy the conditions for such delivery.

     completed Redwood Phase 1 in respect of such Unit in accordance with the
     Unit Plans for such Unit, satisfied the conditions set forth in
     subparagraph (1) of Section 5 hereof and delivered to Owner on Interim
     Advance Certificate with respect thereto.

          (q)  Exhibit K.  Agent shall breach its obligations under Exhibit K

     hereto.

          11.4 Owner's Rights upon Event of Unit Termination.  If any Event of
               ---------------------------------------------                  
Unit Termination with respect to a Unit shall occur, Owner shall have no further
obligation to make advances to Agent with respect to such Unit, and Owner may,
as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, require Agent to purchase such Unit
within fifteen (15) days after notice by Owner at a price equal to the Unit

obligations, (ii) at any time, for any reason (other than an Event of Default by
Owner under a Credit Agreement (as therein defined) which has not been caused by
or resulted from an Event of Default under this Agreement or from a breach by
Agent of its obligations under any agreement or document executed and delivered

Unit FF&E, or Unit to comply with any Legal Requirement applicable to any Unit
Premises, Unit Improvements, item of Unit FF&E, or Unit or the occupancy, use or
operation thereof, so long as no Event of Default exists under this Agreement,
and, in the opinion of Agent's counsel, Agent shall have reasonable grounds to
contest the existence, amount, applicability or validity thereof by appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings in the reasonable judgment of Owner, (i) shall
not involve any material danger that any Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, item
of Unit FF&E, or Unit would be subject to sale, forfeiture or loss, as a result
of failure to comply therewith, (ii) shall not affect the payment of any sums
due and payable hereunder or result in any such sums being payable to any Person
other than Owner or any Assignee, (iii) will not place Owner or any Assignee in
any danger of civil liability which is not adequately indemnified (Agent's
obligations under Section 12 of this Agreement shall be deemed to be adequate
indemnification if no Event of Default or Potential Default exists and if such

$500,000 with respect to all Units) or to any criminal liability, (iv) if
involving taxes, shall suspend the collection of the taxes, and (v) shall be
permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any other

therein. Owner shall cooperate in good faith with Agent with respect to all
Permitted Contests conducted by Agent pursuant to this Section 16.

          (b)  In the event Owner deems, in its sole discretion, that its
interests under this Agreement or in any Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, item
of Unit FF&E or Unit are not adequately protected in connection with a Permitted
Contest brought by Agent under this Section 16, Agent shall give such reasonable
security, as may be demanded by Owner to insure payment of such tax, assessment,
levy, fee, rent, charge or Lien and compliance with any Legal Requirement and to
prevent any sale or forfeiture of any Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, item of
Unit FF&E, or Unit or any other amount due by reason of such nonpayment or
noncompliance.  Agent hereby agrees that Owner may assign such security provided
by Agent to any Assignee.

Contest, Agent shall notify Owner in writing thereof if the amount in contest
exceeds $100,000, and shall describe such proceeding in reasonable detail.  In

assessment or levy of any tax for which Agent is obligated to reimburse Owner
under this Agreement, or in the event that Owner is notified of the commencement
of an audit or similar proceeding which could result in such an additional
assessment, then Owner shall in a timely manner notify Agent in writing of such
proposed levy or proceeding.

          SECTION 17. SALE OR ASSIGNMENT BY OWNER

          (a)  Owner shall have the right to obtain equity and debt financing
for the acquisition and ownership of any Unit Premises, Unit Improvements, Unit
FF&E, and Unit by selling or assigning its right, title and interest in any or
all amounts due from Agent or any third Person under this Agreement; provided,
                                                                     -------- 
that any such sale or assignment shall be subject to the rights and interests of
Agent under this Agreement.

          (b)  Any Assignee shall, except as otherwise agreed by Owner and
Assignee, have all the rights, powers, privileges and remedies of Owner
hereunder, and Agent's obligations as between itself and such Assignee hereunder
shall not be subject to any claims or defense that Agent may have against Owner.
Upon written notice to Agent of any such assignment, Agent shall thereafter make
payments of any and all sums due hereunder to Assignee, to the extent specified
in such notice, and such payments shall discharge the obligation of Agent to
Owner hereunder to the extent of such payments.  Anything contained herein to
the contrary notwithstanding, no Assignee shall be obligated to perform any
duty, covenant or condition required to be performed by Owner hereunder, and any
such duty, covenant or condition shall be and remain the sole obligation of
Owner.

          SECTION 18. GENERAL CONDITIONS

          The following conditions shall be applicable throughout the term of
this Agreement:

          18.1 Survival.  All agreements, representations, and warranties, and
               --------                                                       
the obligation to pay Additional Rent (as defined in the Lease) shall survive
the expiration or other termination hereof.

          18.2 No Waivers.  No advance hereunder shall constitute a waiver of
               ----------                                                    
any of the conditions of Owner's obligation to make further advances nor, in the
event Agent is unable to satisfy any such condition, shall any waiver of such
condition have the effect of precluding Owner from thereafter declaring such
inability to be an Event of Default as herein provided.  Any advance made by
Owner and any sums expended by Owner pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been made pursuant to this Agreement, notwithstanding the existence of
an uncured Event of Default.  No advance shall constitute a waiver of the right
of Owner to require compliance with the covenant contained in subsection 10.1
hereof with respect to any such defects or material departures from any Unit
Plans not theretofore discovered by or called to the attention of Owner.  No
advance at a time when an Event of Default exists shall constitute a waiver of
any right or remedy of Owner existing by reason of such Event of Default,
including, without limitation, the right to refuse to make further advances.

          18.3 Owner and Assignee Sole Beneficiaries.  All conditions of the

obligation of Owner to make advances hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Owner and Assignee and their assigns and no other
Person shall have standing to require satisfaction of such conditions in
accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that Owner will refuse to
make advances in the absence of strict compliance with any or all thereof and no
other Person shall, under any circumstances, be deemed to be a beneficiary of
such conditions, any or all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part by
Owner, with the consent of Assignee, at any time if in its sole discretion, it
deems it advisable to do so.  Inspections and approvals of any Unit Plans, Unit
Premises, Unit Improvements, Unit FF&E, and Unit and the workmanship and
materials used therein impose no responsibility or liability of any nature
whatsoever on Owner, and no Person shall, under any circumstances, be entitled
to rely upon such inspections and approvals by Owner for any reason.  Owner's
sole obligation hereunder is to make the advances if and to the extent required
by this Agreement.

          18.4 No Offsets, Etc.  The obligations of Agent to pay all amounts
               ---------------                                             
payable pursuant to this Agreement and to purchase a Unit hereunder shall be
absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances of any character, and
such amounts shall be paid without notice, demand, defense, setoff, deduction or
counterclaim and without abatement, suspension, deferment, diminution or
reduction of any kind whatsoever, except as herein expressly otherwise provided.
The obligation of Agent to license, or to lease or sublease and pay Basic Rent
(as defined in the Lease), for a Unit upon, in the case of a Redwood Unit,
completion of Redwood Phase 1, or Substantial Completion, in the case of any
Unit, is without any warranty or representation, express or implied, as to any
matter whatsoever on the part of Owner or any Assignee or any Affiliate of
either, or anyone acting on behalf of any of them.

          AGENT HAS SELECTED AND SHALL SELECT ALL UNIT PREMISES, UNIT
IMPROVEMENTS, UNITS AND ITEMS OF UNIT FF&E CONSTRUCTED, ACQUIRED OR ORDERED ON
THE BASIS OF ITS OWN JUDGMENT.  NEITHER

right to include such costs in the Unit Acquisition Cost of Redwood Unit
Premises No. 3) and operate a ground-level attended or unattended temporary
parking facility for motor vehicles of Shorebreeze's tenants and their visitors
while Shorebreeze's existing parking facility on property adjacent to Redwood
Unit Premises 3 is being expanded, and for such other purposes as may be
incidental thereto, but for no other purpose; (iii) such sublicense shall expire
no later than March 31, 1998; (iv) upon termination pursuant to the terms hereof
of such license, Agent, at Agent's sole expense, shall remove such parking

further sub-sublicenses or other use or occupancy agreements or arrangements of
any kind; (vi) such license to Agent shall not diminish any of Agent's
obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 9.3 and
Section 12; (vii) such license shall be not be terminable by Owner except upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default or Potential Default, or with respect to
such Redwood Unit Premises No. 3, Event of Unit Termination or Potential Event

          SECTION 21.    DEVELOPMENT AND SUBDIVISION

                                                    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

consented to and executed by Owner and other third parties and recorded in the
real estate records of San Mateo County, California (such reconfiguration,
subdivision and recordation being referred to in this Agreement as the
"Recordation"). Agent agrees to effect the Recordation as promptly as
practicable and in any event no later than June 15, 1997 and that the failure to
do so shall constitute an Event of Unit Termination as described in Exhibit K
hereto. It is also contemplated (i) that the parcel designated as "Parcel B" on
the Subdivision Map may, at the request of Agent, be conveyed by quitclaim deed
from Owner to Agent provided that, simultaneously therewith Agent shall, for no
consideration, convey such parcel to Shorebreeze, (ii) that any land currently
owned by Owner and designated as "Shoreline Drive" on the Subdivision Map will
be conveyed to the City of Redwood City, California via dedication to the City
on the Subdivision Map, and (iii) that subsequent easements and rights-of-way
will be required, and at the request of Agent will be granted by Owner, for the
Headquarters Unit, for the Unit Improvements to be located on each of Redwood
Unit Premises Nos. 2, 3, and 4, and in connection with the Shores Business
Center of which such real property is a part, provided that in each instance, no
easement or right-of-way shall materially impair the intended use or value of
any such Unit. In each instance, the request of Agent to Owner to execute such
easement or right-of-way shall be deemed to be the representation of the Agent
that the grant thereof will not materially impair the intended use or value of
any such Unit. The net cash amount of any reimbursements received by Owner from
the City of Redwood City pursuant to the Development Agreement dated as of
November 7, 1996 between the Owner and the City of Redwood City shall be
credited against amounts owed by Agent to Owner under this Agreement or the
Lease or, in Owner's sole discretion, deducted from the Unit Acquisition Cost of
the Redwood Unit Premises on a pro rata basis.

          Re:  Amended and Restated Agreement for Lease
               ----------------------------------------

Gentlemen:

          Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Agreement for Lease
dated as of March 7, 1997 (the "Agreement for Lease") between Flatirons Funding,
Limited Partnership ("Owner") and Electronic Arts Redwood, Inc. ("Agent").
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning
given to such terms in the Agreement for Lease.

          Agent has received an Initial Advance with respect to the acquisition
of certain Unit Premises located at the northwestern corner of the intersection
of Twin Dolphin Drive and Redwood Shores Parkway, Redwood City, California, as
more particularly described on Schedule A to this Exhibit K (the "Existing
Premises").  Subsequent to the date hereof, with the consent of Owner, such Unit
Premises will be reconfigured and subdivided into the Headquarters Unit
Premises, Redwood Unit Premises No. 2, Redwood Unit Premises No. 3 and Redwood
Unit Premises No. 4.  Because construction did not commence immediately on the
foregoing Unit Premises, the Agent previously received a waiver of certain
requirements of Section 4 of the Agreement for Lease until such time as
construction of the Unit Improvements thereon was scheduled to commence.

          Although, pursuant to letter agreement, dated as of February 14, 1995
between Owner and Agent ("Prior Letter Agreement"), Agent was obligated to
provide to Owner a certificate substantially in the form of Schedule B hereto in
respect of the Unit Premises which includes the Headquarters Unit Premises and
the Redwood Units prior to initiating construction activities thereon,
construction of the Headquarters Unit Improvements has commenced, and such
certificate was not provided. As required by the Prior Letter Agreement, Agent
delivers to
<PAGE>
 
                                                     THIS AGREEMENT FOR LEASE IS
                                                    CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY


you herewith completed certificates, in the form attached to the Prior Letter
Agreement, for the Headquarters Unit and Redwood Phase 1 of each Redwood Unit.
Owner and Assignee (i) acknowledge that such certificates have been accepted and
(ii) Owner waives, and Assignee consents to the waiver of, any Event of Unit
Termination or Event of Default resulting from the Agent's failure to deliver
such certificates prior to the commencement of construction of the Headquarters
Unit.

          In addition, because the Headquarters Unit Premises, Redwood Unit
Premises No. 2, Redwood Unit Premises No. 3, and Redwood Unit Premises No. 4
will not legally exist until Recordation, Agent hereby agrees that the
Subdivision Map will be recorded in exactly the form of Exhibit L to the
Agreement for Lease no later than June 15, 1997 and that failure to do so will
constitute an Event of Unit Termination.  For purposes hereof, and, except as
expressly provided herein, for all other purposes under the Agreement for Lease,
including, without limitation, subsection 11.3, until Recordation the Existing
Premises shall be deemed to be a Unit Premises, regardless of whether advances
made or being made have been allocated to the Headquarters Unit Premises, to one
or more Redwood Unit Premises, or to the Existing Premises as a whole.

          In addition to the foregoing, Agent acknowledges and agrees that until
the Subdivision Map has been recorded in accordance with this letter:

          1.   Agent shall have no rights of purchase under Section 19, no
rights to any license under Section 20, and no rights under Section 21; and

          2.   Agent shall maintain a single policy of title insurance in the
amount of $150,000,000 with respect to the Existing Premises, provided that such
policy complies in all other respects with the Agreement for Lease, and provided
further that upon the recordation of the Subdivision Map, (a) such title policy
shall be amended and reissued as four separate title policies, each in the
respective amounts of the Unit Budgets for the Headquarters Unit, Redwood Unit
Premises No. 2., Redwood Unit Premises No. 3, and Redwood Unit Premises No.4,
and otherwise complying with the Agreement for Lease, and (b) Agent shall
execute, with respect to the Headquarters Unit and each Redwood Unit, an amended
and restated memorandum of lease amending and restating the Memorandum of Lease
originally recorded against the Existing Premises, or at Owner's option, Agent
shall execute such memoranda prior to recordation of the Subdivision Map.

          Notwithstanding that the Subdivision Map has not been recorded, Unit
Plans, Unit FF&E, and Unit Budgets shall be delivered with respect to the
Headquarters Unit and each Redwood Unit, and all advances requested by Agent
shall be allocated to the Headquarters Unit or to a Redwood Unit, in the same
manner as if the Subdivision Map had been recorded and in order to give maximum
effect to the intent of the Agreement for Lease as drafted. The Unit Acquisition
Cost of the Existing Unit Premises shall equal the sum of the Unit Acquisition
Cost of the Headquarters Unit Premises and the Redwood Unit Premises.

          In addition, Agent hereby requests your consent to the following with
respect to each of the Redwood Unit Premises No. 2, Redwood Unit Premises No. 3
and Redwood Unit

          Amendment No. 1 dated as of March 7, 1997 to Lease Agreement
("Amendment No. 1"), dated as of February 14, 1995, between Flatirons Funding,

Agreement referred to below.

          WHEREAS,  Owner and Agent have heretofore entered into a Lease

          WHEREAS, Owner and Agent wish to amend the Lease Agreement as
hereinafter provided;

          NOW, THEREFORE, Owner and Agent hereby agree that the Lease Agreement
is amended as follows:

          1.   Section 1 of the Lease Agreement is amended by deleting the
second sentence of the term "Assignee" and replacing it with the following:

     "For purposes of paragraph (h) of Section 2, clauses (i), (iv) and (v) of
     paragraph (f) of Section 10 and Section 11 hereof and subsection 9.6 and 12
     of the Agreement for Lease, the term "Assignee" shall include any lender to
     the Lessor or other Person providing credit support to the Lessor pursuant
     to a Credit Agreement."

          2.   Subparagraph (iv) of paragraph (a) of Section 3 of the Lease
Agreement is hereby deleted and restated in its entirety as follows:

     "(iv) with respect to any Property acquired and built pursuant to the
     Agreement for Lease, Substantial Completion (as defined in the Agreement
     for Lease) or the Designated Effective Date (as defined in the Agreement
     for Lease) shall have occurred; and".

          3.   Section 3 of the Lease Agreement is amended by adding the
following as new paragraph (g) thereof:

     "(g) In the event the Lessee failed to achieve Substantial Completion prior
     to the Designated Effective Date with respect to any Parcel of Property
     acquired and built pursuant to the Agreement for Lease, the Lessee may
     deliver to the Lessor thereafter, but prior to Substantial Completion (as
     defined in the Agreement for Lease) of such Parcel, Interim Advance
     Certificates (as defined in the Agreement for Lease) and thereafter a
     Certificate of Substantial Completion (as defined in the Agreement for
     Lease) pursuant to the Agreement for Lease setting forth the actual amount
     expended by the Lessee for items included in the Unit Budget (as defined in
     the Agreement for Lease) with respect to such Parcel while it is subject to
     the Agreement for Lease.  If the conditions set forth in the Agreement for
     Lease for Interim Advances (as defined in the Agreement for Lease) or a
     Final Advance (as defined in the Agreement for Lease) are satisfied, in the
     applicable case, the Lessee and the Lessor shall execute within seven (7)
     days of receipt of each 

                                       1

     such Interim Advance Certificate or Certificate of Substantial Completion
     from the Lessee a revised AFL Unit Leasing Record to amend the Adjusted
     Acquisition Cost for such Parcel to reflect the increase in the Acquisition
     Cost."

          4.   Section 12 of the Lease Agreement is amended by revising the last
sentence of paragraph (a) thereof to read, in its entirety, as follows:

     "At the time a Parcel of Property or Unit of Equipment is sold pursuant to
     this Section 12, such Parcel or Unit shall be in compliance with all Legal
     Requirements, shall not be subject to any Permitted Contest or any Lien
     and, in the case of a Parcel which had been subject to the Agreement for
     Lease, Substantial Completion (as defined in the Agreement for Lease) shall
     be required to have occurred."

          5.   Section 18 of the Lease Agreement is amended by adding the
following as new paragraph (l) thereof:

     "(l) With respect to a Parcel of Property for which Substantial Completion
     has not yet been effected, the construction of such Parcel of Property for
     which Substantial Completion has not yet been effected proceeds or is made
     in a manner other than as provided in this Lease or the Agreement for Lease
     and the Lessee fails to correct such nonconformance in a reasonably prompt
     and satisfactory fashion after notice and demand by the Lessor, or the
     Lessee shall fail to correct promptly any structural defect in such Parcel
     of Property upon demand of the Lessor or the Agent shall default in the
     performance of the covenants contained in Section 2, Section 9 or Section
     10 of the Agreement for Lease in respect of any such Parcel of Property
     after the expiration of any grace period applicable thereto in the
     Agreement for Lease."
 
          6.   Section 23 of the Lease Agreement is amended to delete the name
"Martin J. McInerney" and to replace it with the name "Gerard Haugh".

          7.   This Amendment No. 1 may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed an original and all of
which counterparts, taken together, shall constitute but one and the same
Amendment No. 1.

          8.   This Amendment No. 1 shall in all respects be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, including all
matters of construction, validity and performance.

          9.   Except as provided herein, all provisions, terms and conditions
of the Lease Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.  As amended
hereby, the Lease Agreement is ratified and confirmed in all respects.
