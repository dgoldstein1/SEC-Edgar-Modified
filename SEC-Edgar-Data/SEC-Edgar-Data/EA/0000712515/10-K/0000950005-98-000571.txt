Item 1:  BUSINESS

Overview

         Electronic Arts' predecessor was incorporated in California in 1982. In
September 1991,  Electronic Arts was reincorporated  under the laws of Delaware.
Unless  otherwise  indicated,  the  "Company" or  "Electronic  Arts,"  refers to
Electronic Arts Inc., a Delaware corporation, its California predecessor and its
wholly-owned  and  majority-owned   subsidiaries.   Electronic  Arts'  principal
executive  offices  are located at 1450  Fashion  Island  Boulevard,  San Mateo,
California 94404. Its telephone number is (650) 571-7171.

         Electronic   Arts   creates,   markets  and   distributes   interactive
entertainment  software  for a variety of  hardware  platforms.  As of March 31,
1998, the Company  marketed  approximately  97 titles developed and/or published
under one of its brand names in North America,  including  older titles marketed
as "Classics" or "Publisher's  Choice."  Additionally,  the Company  distributes
localized  versions of these products in the rest of the world. The Company also
distributed  approximately  22  additional  titles  developed by other  software
publishers  ("Affiliated  Labels") in North  America  and over 1,000  Affiliated
Label  titles in the rest of the world.  Since its  inception,  the  Company has
developed products for 37 different computer hardware  platforms,  including the
following: IBM PC-CD and compatibles, 16-bit Sega Genesis video game system (the
"Genesis"),  16-bit Super Nintendo Entertainment System (the "SNES"),  Macintosh
CD, 3DO  Interactive  Multiplayer,  the  PlayStation  ("PlayStation"),  the Sega
Saturn ("Saturn") and the Nintendo 64 ("N64"). The Company's fiscal 1998 product
releases  were  primarily  for PC-CD and 32-bit  video game  platforms  and to a
lesser  degree  16-bit and N64  cartridge  products.  As of March 31, 1998,  the
Company was developing products for four different hardware platforms.

                                       3


<PAGE>

         The Company's product  development methods and organization are modeled
on  those  used in the  entertainment  industry,  and the  Company  markets  its
products with  techniques  borrowed from other  entertainment  companies such as
record producers, magazine publishers and video distributors.  Company employees
called "producers",  who are each responsible for the development of one or more
products,  oversee  product  development  and  direct  teams  comprised  of both
Electronic Arts employees and outside  contractors.  Electronic  Arts' designers
regularly work with celebrities and  organizations in sports,  entertainment and
other areas to develop  products  that provide  gaming  experiences  that are as
realistic and interactive as possible.  Celebrities and organizations  with whom
the Company has had contracts include:  FIFA, NASCAR,  John Madden, the National
Basketball  Association,  the PGA TOUR,  Tiger Woods, the National Hockey League
and World Championship  Wrestling Inc. The Company maintains development studios
in California,  Canada, United Kingdom,  Florida,  Texas, Japan,  Washington and
Maryland.

         The Company invests in the creation of state-of-the-art  software tools
and utilities that are then used in product  development.  These tools allow for
more  cost-effective  product  development  and the ability to more  efficiently
convert  products  from one hardware  platform to another.  The Company has also
made  investments  in facilities  and  equipment to facilitate  the creation and
editing of digital forms of video and audio  recordings and product  development
efforts for new hardware platforms.

         Additionally, the Company produces film, videotape and audio recordings
to include in its products. Two of the Company's  subsidiaries,  Electronic Arts
Productions Inc. (d/b/a  Crocodile  Productions) and Electronic Arts Productions
Ltd.,  have signed  agreements with the Screen Actors Guild ("SAG") and American
Federation  of Television  and Radio Artists  ("AFTRA") in the United States and
with  British  Actors  Equity  Association  ("Equity")  in the  United  Kingdom,
respectively,  giving  the  Company  access to a wide range of talent for use in
Company-produced  film and video for  inclusion in the Company's  products.

         Electronic  Arts  distributes  its products and those of its Affiliated
Labels  primarily  by direct  sales to retail  chains and  outlets in the United
States and Europe. In Japan and the Asia Pacific region, the Company distributes
products both directly to retailers  and through third party  distributors.  The
Company's products are available in over 57,000 retail locations  worldwide.  In
fiscal 1998,  approximately  43% of the Company's net revenues were generated by
international  operations,  compared  to 45% and 40% in fiscal  1997 and  fiscal
1996, respectively.

Investments and Joint Ventures

         Acquisitions

         Maxis, Inc.

         On July 25,  1997,  the Company  completed  a merger  with Maxis,  Inc.
("Maxis"),  a  California-based   interactive  software  developer.   Under  the
transaction,  approximately  4.1 million  shares of Electronic  Arts' stock were
exchanged for all outstanding  Maxis common stock. The transaction was accounted
for as a pooling of interests. The accompanying financial statements,  notes and
analyses  have  been  restated  for  all  periods   presented  to  reflect  this
transaction.  See note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,
included in Item 8 hereof.

         Electronic Arts Japan

         In December  1997,  the Company  acquired the  remaining  35% ownership
interest in  Electronic  Arts Victor,  Inc.  ("EAV")  from Victor  Entertainment
Industries,  Inc. ("VEI") for  approximately  $3,225,000 in cash. As a result of
the acquisition,  the joint venture has become a wholly-owned  subsidiary of the
Company and has been renamed  Electronic Arts, K.K. ("EAJ").  See note 10 of the
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 hereof.

         Tiburon Entertainment, Inc.

         On April 1, 1998,  the Company  acquired  Tiburon  Entertainment,  Inc.
("Tiburon"),  an entertainment software developer based in Florida. Prior to the
acquisition, the Company had a minority investment interest in Tiburon.

         Joint Ventures

         EA Square

         In May 1998, the Company and Square Co., Ltd. ("Square"), a third-party
video game console software  publisher in Japan,  completed the formation of two
new joint ventures, one in North America and one in Japan. In North America, the
companies  formed Square  Electronic  Arts, LLC, which has exclusive  publishing
rights in North America for future interactive  entertainment  titles created by
Square. Additionally, the Company has the exclusive right to distribute in North
America  products  published  by this  joint  venture.  The  Company  owns a 30%
minority interest in this joint venture while Square owns 70%.

         In Japan,  the companies  established  Electronic Arts Square KK, which
will localize and publish in Japan the Company's  properties  originally created
in North America and Europe, as well as develop and publish original video games
in Japan. The Company owns a 70% majority ownership interest,  while Square owns
30%.

Investments

         The Company has made  investments  as part of its overall  strategy and
currently  holds  minority  equity  interests  in several  companies,  including
NovaLogic,  Inc., Firaxis Software, Inc., Stormfront Studios, Mpath Interactive,
Accolade,  Inc.  and The 3DO  Company  ("3DO").  See  Factors  Affecting  Future
Performance - Investment In Affiliates at page 30.

         Divestiture

         In December 1997,  the Company  completed the sale of its 50% ownership
interest in Creative  Wonders,  LLC (formerly ABC/EA Home Software LLC), a joint
venture company formed with the Walt Disney Company  (formerly  Capital Cities /
ABC, Inc.). Prior to the sale, the Company  distributed  children's  interactive
titles  published  and sold by the joint  venture into the retail  channel.  The
investment was accounted for under the equity method prior to the sale. See note
10 of the Notes to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  included in Item 8
hereof.

Market

         Historically,  no hardware  platform or system has  achieved  long-term
dominance in the interactive  entertainment market. This phenomenon has resulted
in the  Company  developing  products  at one time or another  for 37  different
hardware platforms.  Today, the competition in the market for hardware platforms
has  intensified.  In fiscal 1998, the hardware market was  characterized by the
growth  in  the  installed  base  of  next  generation  systems,  primarily  the
PlayStation and N64. In addition, the installed base of multimedia-enabled  home
computers, including those with internet accessibility, has continued to grow as
PC prices have declined and the quality and choices of software  have  increased
dramatically  .  The  Company  develops  and  publishes  products  for  multiple
platforms,  and  this  diversification  continues  to be a  cornerstone  of  the
Company's strategy.

         The  interactive  software  industry  has  recently  undergone  another
significant change due in part to the introduction of new hardware platforms, as
well as remote and electronic  delivery  systems.  The new generation of systems
are  based on 32-bit  and  64-bit  microprocessors  that  incorporate  dedicated
graphics  chipsets.  Many of these systems  utilize CD-ROM  drives.  The Company
began development of 32-bit software products over six years ago by creating the
original software  development  system for the first of these advanced products,
the 3DO Interactive  Multiplayer ("3DO"),  which was introduced in calendar year
1993. Sega and Sony each began  distribution  of their next generation  hardware
systems (named the "Saturn" and "PlayStation," respectively) in Japan during the
quarter ended December 1994. Sega began limited  shipment of the Saturn in North
America in May 1995 and Sony began shipping the  PlayStation in North America in
September 1995.


                                       6
<PAGE>


         In June  1996,  Nintendo  shipped  the N64 in  Japan  and  subsequently
introduced  the  system  in  North  America  in  September  1996.  The  N64 is a
cartridge-based  video  game  platform  which  uses  a  64-bit   microprocessor.
Additionally, Nintendo is developing the N64DD, a disk drive add on to the N64.

         Sega is scheduled to launch Dreamcast(TM) in Japan in November 1998 and
in North  America in the fall of 1999.  Sega is  designing  Dreamcast to combine
features from the console and PC platforms.

         New  entrants  in  the   interactive   entertainment   and   multimedia
industries,  such as cable  television,  telephone  and  diversified  media  and
entertainment  companies,  and a  proliferation  of new  technologies,  such  as
on-line networks and the internet may increase the competition in the markets in
which the Company  competes.  The  Company's  new  product  releases in its 1999
fiscal year will be primarily for the IBM PC-CD and compatibles, the PlayStation
and the N64.  The  Company  is also  scheduled  to release  one or more  on-line
network  gaming  products  during  fiscal  1999.  See Factors  Affecting  Future
Performance - The Industry and Competition at page 28.

         The early investment in products for the 32-bit market,  including both
Compact Disk personal computer  ("PC-CD") and CD-dedicated video game ("CD-video
game") platforms,  has been  strategically  important in positioning the Company
for the current  generation of 32-bit  machines.  The Company believes that such
investment  continues to be important and will continue  aggressive  development
activities  for  32-bit and  64-bit  platforms.  Although  the  PlayStation  has
achieved  significant market acceptance in all geographical  territories,  there
can be no  assurance  that its growth will  continue at the present  rates.  The
market  acceptance of the N64,  particularly  in North  America and Europe,  may
adversely affect the growth rate of the 32-bit  CD-platforms.  In addition,  the
Company's revenues and earnings are dependent on its ability to meet its product
release  schedule  and its  failure  to meet  those  schedules  could  result in
revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts'  expectations for the fiscal
year.  See Factors  Affecting  Future  Performance  -  Development  and Platform
Changes, respectively, at page 28.

Relationships with Significant Hardware Platform Companies

         Sony

         In fiscal 1998,  approximately  42% of the  Company's net revenues were
derived  from sales of software  for the  PlayStation  compared to 28% in fiscal
1997.  PlayStation  products were first  released  during the second  quarter of
fiscal 1996.  During  fiscal 1998,  the Company  released 25  PlayStation  games
compared to 14 in fiscal 1997. Among these

                                       7

<PAGE>

releases were FIFA:  Road to World Cup `98, NBA Live `98, Nascar `98, Madden NFL
`98 and NHL `98.  The  volume  of sales of  PlayStation  products  significantly
increased  in  fiscal  1998  due  to  the  increase  in the  installed  base  of
PlayStation  consoles  worldwide  and the  quality  and  timely  release  of the
Company's key franchise titles.  Although revenues from the sales of PlayStation
products in fiscal 1999 are  expected to continue to grow,  the Company does not
expect to maintain these growth rates. See Factors Affecting Future  Performance
- - Development at page 28.

         Under  the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony
Computer  Entertainment  of  America  in July 1994 (the  "Sony  Agreement"),  as
amended,  the Company is authorized to develop and distribute  CD-based software
products  compatible with the PlayStation.  Pursuant to the Sony Agreement,  the
Company  engages  Sony to supply its  PlayStation  CDs for  distribution  by the
Company.  Accordingly,  the Company has limited ability to control its supply of
PlayStation CD products or the timing of their delivery.  See Factors  Affecting
Future Performance - Hardware Companies at page 29.

     In  connection  with  the  Company's  purchases  of  Sony  products  to  be
distributed in Japan, Sony of Japan requires cash deposits totaling one-third of
the purchase orders. At March 31, 1998, EAJ had no outstanding deposits to Sony.
EAJ utilizes a line of credit to fund these deposits and other operating  needs.
At March 31, 1998, EAJ had lines of credit of approximately  $6,138,000 of which
$4,604,000 was outstanding.

         Nintendo

         During  fiscal 1998,  the Company  released two new titles for the N64,
Madden 64 and FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98. In fiscal 1998,  approximately  6% of
the Company's  net revenues were derived from the sale of N64 products  compared
to 3% in 1997.  In March 1997,  the Company  signed a licensing  agreement  with
Nintendo (the "N64 Agreement") to develop, publish and market certain sports and
other products for the N64. Sales of N64 products are expected to grow in fiscal
1999,  but as revenues  for these  products  increase,  they may not grow at the
current rate.

         Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  the Company engages  Nintendo to
manufacture its N64 cartridges for distribution by the Company. Accordingly, the
Company  has  limited  ability to control  its supply of N64  cartridges  or the
timing of their delivery.  A shortage of microchips or other factors outside the
control of the Company could impair the Company's  ability to obtain an adequate
supply of cartridges.

         As the  16-bit  videogame  market  has  made  the  transition  to  next
generation 32-bit and 64-bit systems, the Company does not expect to release any
new SNES titles in fiscal 1999 and  revenues  from the sale of SNES  products in
fiscal 1999 are not expected to be significant.

                                       8


<PAGE>

          In  connection  with the  Company's  purchases of N64  cartridges  for
distribution  in  North  America,  Nintendo  requires  the  Company  to  provide
irrevocable letters of credit prior to Nintendo's  acceptance of purchase orders
from the  company  for  purchases  of these  cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64
cartridges for distribution in Japan and Europe,  Nintendo  requires the Company
to make cash deposits. Furthermore, Nintendo maintains a policy of not accepting
returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these and other factors,  the carrying of
an inventory of cartridges  entails  significant  capital and risk.  See Factors
Affecting Future Performance - Hardware Companies at page 29.

     Sega

         In the  fiscal  year  ended  March 31,  1998,  approximately  2% of the
Company's  net  revenue  came from sales of Saturn  products  compared  to 6% in
fiscal 1997.  During fiscal 1998,  the Company  released  eight Saturn  products
compared with 12 in fiscal 1997. As the  installed  base of Saturn  consoles has
not achieved the growth rates of PlayStation  consoles,  the Company's  revenues
from  sales of  Saturn  products  have  declined  and are  expected  to  decline
significantly  in future  years.  The  Company  plans no new  releases of Saturn
products in fiscal 1999.

         Additionally, as the 16-bit videogame market has made the transition to
next  generation  32-bit  and 64-bit  systems,  the  Company  does not expect to
release any new titles for the Genesis in fiscal 1999 and, accordingly, revenues
from  the  sale  of  Genesis  products  in  fiscal  1999 is not  expected  to be
significant.


Products and Product Development

         In fiscal 1998, the Company generated approximately 70% of its revenues
from products released during the year. See Factors Affecting Future Performance
- - Products at page 28. As of March 31, 1998, the Company was actively  marketing
approximately  97  titles,  comprising  approximately  189 stock  keeping  units
("sku's"),  that were  published  by the  Company's  development  divisions  and
subsidiaries ("EA Studios").  During fiscal 1998, the Company introduced over 44
EA Studios titles,  representing over 71 sku's, compared to 36 EA Studio titles,
comprising over 68 sku's, in fiscal 1997.

         The  products  published  by EA Studios are designed and created by its
in-house   designers  and  artists  and  by  independent   software   developers
("independent  artists").  The Company  typically pays the  independent  artists
royalties based on the sales of the specific products, as defined in the related
independent artist agreements.

         For fiscal 1998, no title represented  revenues greater than 10% of the
total  fiscal 1998 net  revenues.  For fiscal  1997,  the Company had one title,
Madden   Football  `97,   published  on  five   platforms,   which   represented
approximately  10% of the total fiscal 1997 net revenues.  For fiscal 1996,  the
Company had one title,  FIFA  Soccer  '96,

                                       9


<PAGE>

published on six platforms,  which  represented  approximately  10% of the total
fiscal 1996 net revenues.

         The  Company  publishes  products  in a number  of  categories  such as
sports, action and interactive movies, strategy,  simulations,  role playing and
adventure,  each of which is becoming  increasingly  competitive.  The Company's
sports-related products,  marketed under the EA Sports brand name, accounted for
a significant  percentage  of net revenues in fiscal years 1998 and 1997.  There
can be no  assurance  that the Company will be able to maintain its market share
in the sports category.  See Factors Affecting Future  Performance -The Industry
and Competition at page 28.

         The front line retail  selling prices in North America of the Company's
products,  excluding  older titles  (marketed  as  "Classics"  and  "Publisher's
Choice"),  typically  range from $35.00 to $55.00.  "Classics" and  "Publisher's
Choice" titles have retail selling prices that range from $10.00 to $15.00.  The
retail  selling prices of EA titles outside of North America vary based on local
market conditions.

         The Company currently develops or publishes products for four different
hardware  platforms and has from time to time developed and marketed products on
37 different and incompatible platforms in the past. In fiscal 1998, the Company
product releases were  predominantly for PC-CD,  32-bit video game platforms and
to a lesser degree 16-bit and 64-bit video game systems.  The Company's  planned
product  introductions  for fiscal  1999 are  predominantly  for the PC-CD,  the
PlayStation,  the N64 as well as for online  internet  play in fiscal 1999.  See
Factors  Affecting  Future  Performance  -  Development  and  Platform  Changes,
respectively, at page 28.

         As compact discs have emerged as the preferred  medium for  interactive
entertainment,  education,  and information software,  the Company continued its
investment in the  development of CD-ROM tools and  technologies  in fiscal 1998
and  currently  has more than 27  products  in  development  for  CD-video  game
platforms,   including  the  PC-CD  and  PlayStation  platforms.   Although  the
PlayStation  has  achieved  significant  market  acceptance  in  all  geographic
territories,  there can be no  assurance  that its growth  will  continue at the
present rates. The market  acceptance of the N64,  particularly in North America
and Europe,  may  adversely  affect the growth rate of the 32-bit  CD-platforms.
Most of the  CD-video  game  products  will be  convertible  for use on multiple
advanced  hardware  systems.  During the fiscal years 1998,  1997 and 1996,  the
Company had research and  development  expenditures  of $146.2  million,  $130.8
million,  and  $108.0  million,   respectively.  See  Factors  Affecting  Future
Performance - Development at page 28.


Marketing and Distribution

         The Company  distributes both EA Studio products and products developed
and published by other software publishers known as "Affiliated Labels."

                                       10

<PAGE>

         In most cases,  Affiliated  Label products are delivered to the Company
as  completed  products.  As of March  31,  1998,  the  Company  distributed  22
Affiliated  Label titles in North America and over 1,000 Affiliated Label titles
in the rest of the world. No single Affiliated Label has accounted for more than
10% of the Company's net revenue in any of the last three fiscal years.

         In May 1998,  the  Company  and  Square  Co.,  Ltd.  formed a new joint
venture in North America,  creating Square  Electronic Arts, LLC as discussed in
note 15 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,  included in Item
8 hereof.  In conjunction with the formation of this joint venture,  the Company
will have the exclusive right in North America to distribute  products published
by this joint venture.

         In  February  1998,  the  Company  announced  that it  entered  into an
international co-publishing agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ("MGM") to be the
exclusive  distributor of MGM Interactive titles in all territories except North
America.

         During fiscal 1997, the Company  entered into a one year agreement with
Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment outside of North America and multi-year
agreements with Accolade,  Inc. and DreamWorks Interactive in Europe and certain
Asian territories.

         The  Company  generated  approximately  90% of its North  American  net
revenues from direct sales through a field sales  organization of  professionals
and a group of telephone sales  representatives.  The remaining 10% of its North
American sales were made through a limited  number of  specialized  and regional
distributors and rack jobbers in markets where the Company believes direct sales
would not be economical.  The Company had no customers  accounting for more than
10% of total net revenues for the years ended March 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.

         As discussed above, (See Market above) the video game and PC businesses
have  become  increasingly  "hits"  driven,   requiring   significantly  greater
expenditures  for  marketing  and   advertising,   particularly  for  television
advertising. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to produce
"hit"  titles,   or  that  advertising  for  any  product  will  increase  sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

         The Company has  stock-balancing  programs  for its  personal  computer
products that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified amount,  allow
for the exchange of personal  computer  products by resellers.  The Company also
typically provides for price protection for its personal computer and video game
system  products  that,  under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price
reduction from the Company for unsold products.  The Company  maintains a policy
of  exchanging  products  or giving  credits,  but does not give  cash  refunds.
Moreover,  the risk of product  returns may increase as new  hardware  platforms
become more popular or market  factors  force the Company to make changes in its
distribution system. The Company monitors and manages the volume of its sales to

                                       11

<PAGE>

retailers and distributors and their inventories as substantial  overstocking in
the  distribution  channel  can result in high  returns or the  requirement  for
substantial price protection in subsequent periods. The Company believes that it
provides  adequate  reserves for returns and price protection which are based on
estimated   future  returns  of  products,   taking  into  account   promotional
activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer
inventories of the Company's  products and other  factors,  and that its current
reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection requirements for
current  in-channel  inventory.  However,  there can be no assurance that actual
returns or price protection will not exceed the Company's reserves.  See Factors
Affecting Future Performance - Revenue and Expenses at page 29.

         The Company also has a fulfillment group that sells product directly to
consumers  through a toll-free  number listed in  advertising by the Company and
its Affiliated  Labels.  This group is also responsible for targeted direct mail
marketing  and sells product  upgrades,  backups and  accessories  to registered
customers.

         The distribution  channels through which consumer software products are
sold have been characterized by change,  including  consolidations and financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business difficulties of a distributor or retailer could render Electronic Arts'
accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible,  which could have an adverse
effect on the operating results and financial  condition of the Company.  In the
quarter  ended  September  1996,  the Company  recorded  $3,331,000  in bad debt
expenses  related to  uncollectible  receivables  from a customer  who filed for
bankruptcy.  In addition,  an  increasing  number of companies are competing for
access to these channels.  Electronic Arts'  arrangements  with its distributors
and  retailers  may be  terminated  by either party at any time  without  cause.
Distributors  and retailers  often carry products that compete with those of the
Company.  Retailers of Electronic Arts' products typically have a limited amount
of shelf space and promotional resources for which there is intense competition.
There can be no assurance  that  distributors  and  retailers  will  continue to
purchase  Electronic  Arts' products or provide  Electronic  Arts' products with
adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support.

International Operations

         The  Company  has  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  throughout  the  world,
including  offices in the United Kingdom,  France,  Spain,  Germany,  Australia,
Canada, South Africa,  Singapore,  Sweden, Puerto Rico, Japan, Malaysia,  Brazil
and Holland.  The amounts of net  revenues,  operating  profit and  identifiable
assets attributable to each of the Company's  geographic regions for each of the
last  three  fiscal  years  are  set  forth  in  Note  14 of  the  Notes  to the
Consolidated  Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.  International net
revenues  increased by 30% to $389,429,000,  or 43% of consolidated  fiscal 1998
net revenues,  compared to  $300,412,000,  or 45% of the fiscal 1997 total.  The
increase  in  international  revenues  was  due to  higher  worldwide  sales  of
PlayStation products and

                                       12

<PAGE>

increased sales of PC-CD,  N64 and AL products in Europe and Asia Pacific.  This
was  partially   offset  by  a  decrease  in  32-bit  product  sales  in  Japan,
international 16-bit video game cartridge revenues and licensing of EA products.
In fiscal 1998, the Company continued its strategy to expand into emerging world
markets by opening offices in Austria, Switzerland, Brazil and Portugal.

         Though  international  revenues  are  expected to grow in fiscal  1999,
international revenues may not grow at as high a rate as in prior years.

Manufacturing

         In fiscal 1998 and prior  years,  a portion of the  Company's  personal
computer CD-ROM  products were  manufactured in Puerto Rico. The Company intends
to phase out its Puerto Rico operations and will contract out with third parties
to produce the Company's CD-ROM products.

         In many  instances,  the  Company  is able to  acquire  materials  on a
volume-discount  basis. The Company has multiple potential sources of supply for
most materials.  Except with respect to its  PlayStation  and N64 products,  the
Company also has alternate  sources for the  manufacture and assembly of most of
its products. To date, the Company has not experienced any material difficulties
or delays in production of its software and related documentation and packaging.
However,  a shortage of components  or other  factors  beyond the control of the
Company could impair the Company's ability to manufacture, or have manufactured,
its products.  See Factors Affecting Future  Performance - Hardware Companies at
page 29.

Backlog

         The Company  normally  ships product within a few days after receipt of
an order.  However,  a backlog  may occur  for EA Studio  and  Affiliated  Label
products that have been  announced for release but not yet shipped.  The Company
does not consider backlog to be an indicator of future performance.

Seasonality

         The  Company's  business  is highly  seasonal.  The  Company  typically
experiences its highest  revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end  holiday
season and a seasonal low in revenues and profits in the quarter ending in June.

                                       13

Employees

         As of March 31, 1998, the Company employed  approximately 2,100 people,
of whom over 1,100 were outside the United States. The Company believes that its
ability to attract and retain qualified  employees is an important factor in its
growth  and  development  and that its  future  success  will  depend,  in large
measure,  on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified  employees.
To date, the Company has been successful in recruiting and retaining  sufficient
numbers of qualified personnel to conduct its business successfully. See Factors
Affecting Future Performance - Employees at page 29.

ITEM 2:  PROPERTIES

         The Company's principal administrative,  sales and marketing,  research
and development, and support facility is located in four modern buildings in San
Mateo,  California,  15 miles  south of San  Francisco.  The  Company  presently
occupies  approximately  196,000 sq. ft. in these  buildings,  under leases that
expire at various times between August 1998 and April 1999.

         In February 1995, the Company entered into a master operating lease for
land and buildings to be constructed in Redwood City,  California.  The facility
is to be used as a corporate  headquarters  for EA. The above  mentioned  rental
space EA currently  occupies in San Mateo,  California is expected to be vacated
upon the completion of the new corporate headquarters. The square footage of the
new  facilities is expected to be  approximately  350,000.  The Company  expects
completion of these facilities in fiscal 1999.

         The Company's North American  distribution is supported by a 54,000 sq.
ft. leased facility used as an office and warehouse in Hayward,  California, and
an 84,000 sq. ft. warehouse facility in Louisville,  Kentucky.  The Company also
occupies sales offices in the metropolitan areas of Toronto, Chicago, Dallas and
New York.  The Company  also has a  manufacturing  facility in San Juan,  Puerto
Rico.

         In  addition  to  the  Company's  San  Mateo  development  studio,  the
Company's North American research and development  activities are supported by a
106,000 sq. ft. development facility in Burnaby, British Columbia,  Canada and a
33,000 sq. ft. facility in Seattle,  Washington. The Company also owns a 180,000
sq.  ft.  development  facility  in  Austin,  Texas and  leases a 42,400 sq. ft.
development facility in Walnut Creek, California.  The Company is constructing a
new facility to include  administrative,  sales  and  development  functions  in
Burnaby,  British  Columbia,  Canada.  The square footage of the new facility is
expected to be  approximately  206,000.  The Company expects  completion of this
facility in fiscal 1999.

         The Company's United Kingdom subsidiary occupies administrative,  sales
and distribution  facilities in Langley,  England,  under a lease for a total of
44,000 sq. ft. and a 22,000 sq. ft. development facility in Surrey,  England. In
Europe,  the Company  also  leases two  administrative,  sales and  distribution
facilities in Germany, as well as sales and distribution  facilities in: Madrid,
Spain; Lyon, France;  Johannesberg,  South Africa; Neudorf,  Austria and Zurich,
Switzerland. Additionally, the Company has sales offices throughout Europe.

         In Asia and the South  Pacific,  the Company  maintains a 5,500 sq. ft.
sales and  distribution  facility in Brisbane,  Australia.  The Company also has
sales and distribution facilities in Singapore,  Malaysia,  Thailand, Taiwan and
New Zealand,  and  representative  offices in Beijing,  Hong Kong and  Shanghai,
China. The Company also maintains a

                                       15
<PAGE>

27,000 sq. ft. sales and development  office in Tokyo,  Japan. See Notes 3 and 8
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 hereof.


         The Company believes that these facilities are adequate for its current
needs. The Company believes that suitable additional or substitute space will be
available as needed to accommodate the Company's future needs.

ITEM 3:  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company is subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,
after review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers that any liability from
the  disposition of such lawsuits would not have a material  adverse effect upon
the consolidated financial condition of the Company.

ITEM 4:  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY
         HOLDERS

         There were no matters  submitted to a vote of security  holders  during
the quarter ended March 31, 1998.

ITEM 7:  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

The following  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations", contains forward looking statements regarding Electronic
Arts' ("the Company" or "EA") future  performance that involve certain risks and
uncertainties   including   those   discussed  in  "Factors   Affecting   Future
Performance" at pages 28 to 30 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual events
or the actual  future  results of the  Company  may differ  materially  from any
forward looking statements due to such risks and uncertainties.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 1998 to 1997

                        1998              1997          % change
- -------------------------------------------------------------------
Net revenues       $908,852,000     $673,028,000      35.0
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company derives revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software,
which   includes  EA  Studio   Compact  Disk  ("CD")   products  for   dedicated
entertainment  systems  ("CD-video  games"),  EA  Studio  CD  personal  computer
products  ("PC-CD"),  EA Studio  cartridge  products and Affiliated Label ("AL")
products that are published by third parties and  distributed by EA. The Company
also  derives  revenues  from  licensing  of EA Studio  products and AL products
to hardware companies ("OEMs") and online subscription revenues.

Total net revenues  increased  compared to the prior year due to increased sales
of PlayStation ("PlayStation") products,  increased worldwide distribution of AL
products,  sales of Nintendo  64-bit ("N64") video game  cartridge  products and
sales of PC-CD  products.  This increase was  partially  offset by a decrease in
sales of 16-bit video game cartridges and License/OEM revenues.

Net revenues from 32-bit CD-video game products,  primarily for the PlayStation,
were  $397,806,000  in fiscal 1998,  representing  44% of the total net revenues
compared  to  $225,875,000,  or 34% of total net  revenues in fiscal  1997.  The
increase in sales of 32-bit video game products was  attributable to the greater
installed base of PlayStation  game consoles and related  releases of key titles
for this platform  during the year offset by a decline in revenues from sales of
products for the Sega Saturn(R) ("Saturn").

Sales of PlayStation  products in fiscal 1998 increased to $380,299,000,  or 42%
of total net revenue,  compared to $187,531,000,  or 28% of total net revenue in
fiscal  1997.  The  Company  released 25 new  PlayStation  titles in fiscal 1998
compared to 14 in fiscal 1997.  The Company  expects  revenues from  PlayStation
products to continue to grow in fiscal 1999,  but as revenues for these products
increase, the Company does not expect to maintain these growth rates.

Net  revenues  derived for other 32-bit  products,  primarily  for Saturn,  were
$17,507,000  in fiscal  1998  compared to  $38,344,000  in fiscal  1997.  As the
installed  base of  Saturn  consoles  has  not  achieved  the  growth  rates  of
PlayStation game consoles,  the Company's revenues from sales of Saturn products
have declined and are expected to decline  significantly  in future  years.  The
Company released eight new Saturn titles in fiscal 1998 compared to 12 in fiscal
1997.  The Company  does not expect to release  any new Saturn  titles in fiscal
1999.

Net  revenues  from  shipments  of AL  products  in  fiscal  1998  increased  to
$185,865,000,  or 20% of total revenue, compared to $96,696,000, or 14% of total
revenue in fiscal 1997.  This increase was due to higher sales of AL products in
North America,  Europe and Asia Pacific.  This increase was  attributable to the
product  releases under a new worldwide  exclusive  distribution  agreement with
Dreamworks  Interactive,  including  The Lost  World:  Jurassic  Park and due to
continued  distribution  of products from  Accolade,  Inc. for which the Company
began  distribution  in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  1997.  AL  revenues  also
increased related to sales of products under exclusive  distribution  agreements
with Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment outside North America. The Company
expects  revenues  from AL products to continue to grow in fiscal  1999,  but as
revenues for these  products  increase,  the Company does not expect to maintain
these growth rates.

Net revenues derived from N64 video game cartridge products were $56,677,000, or
6% of total net revenues,  compared to  $17,804,000  in fiscal 1997. The Company
released  two titles in fiscal  1998  compared to one title in fiscal  1997.  In
March 1997, the Company  signed a licensing  agreement with Nintendo to develop,
publish and market  certain  sports  products for the N64. Sales of N64 products
are  expected  to grow in  fiscal  1999,  but as  revenues  for  these  products
increase, they may not grow at the current rate.

Net  revenues  from PC-CD  products  increased to  $231,034,000  in fiscal 1998,
representing 25% of total net revenues,  from $216,338,000,  or 32% of total net
revenues in fiscal  1997.  The Company  released 30 PC-CD  titles in fiscal 1998
compared  to 32 PC-CD  titles in fiscal  1997.  The  increase  in sales of PC-CD
products  was  attributable  to the  worldwide  growth in the PC market  and the
expansion of the Company's direct distribution worldwide. PC-CD sales growth for
fiscal  1998 was  partially  offset by a decline in titles  published  by Maxis.
Maxis' PC-CD  revenues for fiscal 1998  decreased by $17,010,000 or 45% compared
to fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  generated  by 16-bit  video game  cartridge-based  products  were
$17,314,000, or 2% of total revenues in fiscal 1998, compared to $89,160,000, or
13% of net revenues in fiscal 1997. As the 16-bit video game market has made the
transition to next generation 32-bit and 64-bit systems, the

Company  does not expect to release any new titles in fiscal  1999 and  revenues
from  the  sales  of  16-bit  products  in  fiscal  1999 is not  expected  to be
significant.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated  $15,431,000 in fiscal 1998,  compared
to  $26,749,000  in fiscal  1997.  The decrease  was  primarily  the result of a
decrease in the revenues generated by the licensing of EA products in Europe and
Maxis products in Europe and Japan.

North America net revenues  increased by 39% to  $519,423,000  in fiscal 1998 as
compared to $372,616,000 in fiscal 1997. The increase was mainly attributable to
strong  growth in  PlayStation  and N64  systems as well as AL product  revenues
partially  offset by the decline in 16-bit  cartridge and Saturn  product sales.
Net revenues from  PlayStation  and N64 products  increased  $172,496,000  while
sales  of  16-bit  cartridge  and  Saturn  products  decreased   $62,671,000  in
comparison  to the prior year.  North  America AL sales  increased  $34,355,000,
compared to the prior year.

International  net  revenues  increased  by  30%  to  $389,429,000,  or  43%  of
consolidated fiscal 1998 net revenues,  compared to $300,412,000,  or 45% of the
fiscal 1997 total.  The  increase in  international  revenues  was due to higher
worldwide sales of PlayStation products and increased sales of PC-CD, N64 and AL
products in Europe and Asia Pacific.  This was partially offset by a decrease in
32-bit  product  sales in  Japan,  international  16-bit  video  game  cartridge
revenues and licensing of EA products.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 1998 reflects increased

net revenues and higher  professional  and celebrity  royalties on CD-video game
and PC-CD  titles as well as higher  manufacturing  royalties  on CD-video  game
titles.

The  increase in marketing  and sales  expenses was  primarily  attributable  to
increased television and print advertising to support new releases and increased
cooperative advertising associated with higher revenues as compared to the prior
year.  Increases in marketing  and sales  expenses  were also due to  additional
headcount  related  to  the  continued  expansion  of  the  Company's  worldwide
distribution business.

The  increase in general and  administrative  expenses was  primarily  due to an
increase  in  payroll  and  occupancy  costs due to the  opening  of  additional
international offices and additional depreciation related to the installation of
new management information systems worldwide. This increase was partially offset
by lower spending in Japan.

Increases in marketing and sales as well as general and administrative  expenses
were partially offset by savings  attributable to the integration of Maxis, Inc.
("Maxis") in the second quarter of fiscal 1998.

Increases in research and development  expenses were due to additional headcount
related expenses in North America and Europe  attributable to increased in-house
development  capacity,   higher  development  costs  per  title  and  additional
depreciation of computer equipment.

The Company released a total of 71 new products in fiscal 1998 compared to 68 in
fiscal  1997.  Total  CD-based  new  products  released  for fiscal 1998 were 63
compared to 58 in fiscal 1997.

In connection  with the  acquisition  of the  remaining  35% minority  ownership
interest in Electronic Arts Victor,  Inc.  ("EAV") in December 1997, the Company
incurred a charge of $1,500,000 for acquired in-process technology.  This charge
was made after the  Company  concluded  that the  in-process  technology  had no
alternative  future use after taking into  consideration the potential for usage
of the software in different products and resale of the software.

On July 25, 1997, the Company completed a merger with Maxis. In conjunction with
the merger,  the Company  recorded  costs of $10,792,000  which included  direct
transaction fees and costs associated with integrating the operations of the two
companies.

The  increase  in other  income  is  primarily  due to  higher  interest  income
attributable  to higher  cash  balances as compared to last year and the sale of
the Company's 50% ownership interest in Creative Wonders,  LLC in December 1997.
The sale of Creative  Wonders  resulted in a gain of $12,625,000.  This increase
was  partially  offset by lower gains on sales of  marketable  securities in the
amount of $4,098,000 compared to $8,393,000 in the prior year.

Entertainment Industries,  Inc. ("VEI"). Minority interest for the year reflects
only a portion  of  reported  losses for EAV as the net equity of EAV fell below
zero in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Comparison of Fiscal 1997 to 1996

                        1997            1996        % change
- ---------------------------------------------------------------
Net revenues       $673,028,000    $587,299,000       14.6
- ---------------------------------------------------------------

Total net  revenues  increased  compared to the prior year due to an increase in
net revenues derived from a higher volume of CD-based  products  (CD-video games
and PC-CD), Affiliated Label products and a 64-bit video game cartridge product.
This  was  partially  offset  by a  decrease  in  sales  of  16-bit  video  game
cartridges.

Net revenues from 32-bit  CD-video game products,  including the PlayStation and
Saturn,  were  $225,875,000  in fiscal 1997,  representing  34% of the total net
revenues  compared to $78,003,000,  or 13% of total net revenues in fiscal 1996.
The increase in sales of PlayStation and Saturn products was attributable to the
greater  installed  base of these 32-bit  CD-video game consoles and more titles
published for these consoles by the Company.

Sales of PlayStation  products in fiscal 1997 increased to $187,531,000,  or 28%
of total  revenue,  compared to  $51,971,000,  or 9% of total  revenue in fiscal
1996.  The Company  released 14 new  PlayStation  titles in both fiscal 1997 and
fiscal 1996.

Net revenues  derived from the sales of other 32-bit products were  $38,344,000,
primarily from Saturn products in fiscal 1997,  compared to  $26,032,000,  which
included  both 3DO  Interactive  Multiplayer(R)  ("3DO") and Saturn  products in
fiscal 1996.  The Company  released 12 new Saturn titles in fiscal 1997 compared
to eight 3DO titles and five Saturn titles in fiscal 1996. The Company  produced
no new games for 3DO in fiscal 1997.


                                       24

Net  revenues  from PC-CD  products  increased to  $216,338,000  in fiscal 1997,
representing 32% of total net revenues,  from $183,976,000,  or 31% of total net
revenues in fiscal  1996.  The Company  released 32 PC-CD  titles in fiscal 1997
compared  to 45 titles in fiscal  1996.  Included  in these  totals  were Maxis'
releases of five titles in fiscal 1997,  and 23 in fiscal 1996.  The increase in
sales  of  PC-CD  products  was  attributable  to the  growth  in the PC  market
worldwide,  growth in the sports  category and the  expansion  of the  Company's
direct distribution worldwide.  The increase in fiscal 1997 was partially offset
by a decrease in sales for Maxis due to the late releases for the holiday buying
season as well as a delay in the  release  of the  follow-on  product to SimCity
2000(TM).

Net  revenues  generated  by 16-bit  video game  cartridge-based  products  were
$89,160,000,  or 13% of total revenues in fiscal 1997, compared to $202,599,000,
or 35% of net revenues in fiscal 1996.  Sales of 16-bit video game  hardware and
related  software  have  significantly  declined due to the  transition  to next
generation  32-bit and 64-bit  video game  consoles.  During  fiscal  1997,  the
Company  released  fewer  titles for the 16-bit  platforms as compared to fiscal
1996.

Sales of EA Studio Sega(R) Genesis(TM)  ("Genesis") cartridge products in fiscal
1997 declined to $62,005,000,  or 9% of total revenue, compared to $138,643,000,
or 24% of total  revenue in fiscal  1996.  The Company  released six new Genesis
titles in fiscal 1997, compared to 10 in fiscal 1996.

Net  revenues   derived  from   cartridge   products  for  the  Super   Nintendo
Entertainment  System(R)  ("Super  NES(R)")  were  $27,155,000,  or 4% of  total
revenue,  in fiscal 1997  compared to  $63,956,000,  or 11% of total  revenue in
fiscal 1996.  The Company  released three new titles for the Super NES in fiscal
1997 compared to five in fiscal 1996.

Licensing of EA Studio products generated  $26,749,000 in fiscal 1997,  compared
to $32,221,000 in fiscal 1996. The decrease primarily resulted from lower volume
of  distribution  of the  Company's  products  through OEMs in North America and
Japan and Maxis products in Europe.

Net  revenues  derived  from sales of N64 video  game  cartridge  products  were
$17,804,000 in fiscal 1997. The Company  released its first N64 title during the
fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.

Net  revenues  from  shipments  of AL  products  in  fiscal  1997  increased  to
$96,696,000  from  $81,649,000  in fiscal  1996.  The increase was due to higher
sales  of AL  products  in  Europe  and Asia  Pacific  related  to an  exclusive
international   distribution   agreement   with   Twentieth   Century  Fox  Home
Entertainment and other  affiliates.  This was partially offset by a decrease in
AL net revenues in North  America and Japan.  The decrease in North  America was
attributable  to  lower  volume  of  revenue  from  two  exclusive  distribution
arrangements  for certain PC  entertainment  and 3DO products to key accounts on
behalf of other third party  publishers  which began in fiscal 1996 and the loss
of a significant  affiliate at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 1997. The
decrease in Japan was due to lower volume of sales from existing affiliates.

The Company's revenues from floppy disk products,  hand-held  cartridge products
and  products  from the Sega 32X  platform  decreased to $406,000 in fiscal 1997
from $8,851,000 in fiscal 1996.  Results reflect the now completed  market shift
away from these products to CD-based products. The Company produced no new games
for these platforms in fiscal 1997.

North American net revenues  increased by 5% to  $372,616,000  in fiscal 1997 as
compared to $354,630,000 in fiscal 1996. The increase was mainly attributable to
strong growth in 32-bit CD-video game and PC-CD systems  partially offset by the
decline in 16-bit  sales.  Net  revenues  from sales of CD-video  game and PC-CD
products  increased  $102,074,000  while  sales  of  16-bit  cartridge  products
decreased $83,917,000 in comparison to the prior year.

International  net  revenues  increased  by  29%  to  $300,412,000,  or  45%  of
consolidated  1997 net revenues,  compared to  $232,669,000,  or 40% of the 1996
total. The increase in international  revenues was due to higher worldwide sales
of 32-bit CD-video game products and increased sales of PC-CD and AL products in
Europe and Asia Pacific. This was partially offset by a decrease in 16-bit video
game cartridge products.

expenses for the  operations in Europe and North America and growth in the lower
margin distribution business.

The  increase  in  marketing  and sales  expense  was due to  higher  television
advertising  expenses and higher  co-operative  advertising  expenses associated
with higher  revenues.  Additionally,  marketing and sales expenses,  along with
general and administrative  expenses,  increased due to additional headcount and
higher  facility  expenses  related  to the  opening  of new  sales  offices  in
international  markets.  Increases in general and  administrative  expenses were
also due to implementation  related costs for new management information systems
in North America and Europe.  The increase in research and development  expenses
was primarily due to higher average development costs for CD-based products than
for cartridge products and higher depreciation  expense.  The Company released a
total of 68 new  products in fiscal 1997  compared to 89 in fiscal  1996.  Total
CD-based new products  released for fiscal 1997 were 58 compared to 72 in fiscal
1996.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of March 31, 1998, the Company's working capital was $408,098,000 compared to
$284,863,000  at March 31, 1997.  Cash and short-term  investments  increased by
approximately  $106,419,000 in fiscal 1998. The Company generated $78,993,000 of
cash from  operations  in fiscal  1998.  In addition,  $37,748,000  was provided
through the sale of equity securities under the Company's employee stock plans.

   Reserves for bad debts and sales returns  increased from $43,268,000 at March
31,  1997 to  $51,575,000  at March 31,  1998.  Reserves  have been  charged for
returns of product and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in
prior  periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves  are  adequate  based  on
historical  experience  and  its  current  estimate  of  potential  returns  and
allowances.

   During fiscal 1998 the Company invested approximately $45,000,000,  primarily
in computer  hardware and software  purchases  required to support the Company's
development efforts,  management information systems and expenditures related to
new facilities in Europe and Canada.

   In connection with the Company's purchases of Sony products to be distributed
in Japan,  Sony of Japan requires cash deposits  totaling  one-third of purchase
orders. Additionally,  Nintendo of Japan requires cash deposits on all orders of
N64 cartridge  products.  Electronic Arts, K.K. ("EAJ") utilizes lines of credit
to fund these deposits for purchases of Sony and Nintendo products and for other
operating  requirements.  At  March  31,  1998,  EAJ  had  lines  of  credit  of
approximately $6,138,000 of which $4,604,000 was outstanding.

   The  Company's  principal  source of  liquidity is  $374,560,000  in cash and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment  requirements for the next twelve
months and the foreseeable future.

================================================================================
YEAR 2000

The  Company  is aware of the issues  associated  with the  programming  code in
existing  computer systems as the year 2000 approaches.  The "Year 2000" problem
is complex and pervasive as many  computer  systems will be affected in some way
by the rollover of the two-digit  year value to 00. Systems that do not properly
recognize such  information  could generate  erroneous data or cause a system to
fail. The Year 2000 issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen  problems
in its own computer  systems and from third parties with which the Company deals
on financial  transactions  worldwide.  Failures of the  Company's  and/or third
parties'  computer systems could have a material adverse impact on the Company's
ability to conduct business.  For example, a significant  percentage of purchase
orders  received  from  the  Company's  customers  are  computer  generated  and
electronically  transmitted.  A failure of the computer systems of the Company's
customers  to be Year 2000  compliant  could  significantly  impact  the  orders
received by the Company from such customer.

The  Company's  financial  information  systems  include an Oracle system in the
United States and Europe,  which the Company believes to be Year 2000 compliant.
The  Company  is  analyzing  its  remaining  computer  systems to  identify  any
potential Year 2000 issues and will take appropriate  corrective action based on
the results of such analysis. Management has not yet determined the cost related
to achieving Year 2000 compliance.

In  addition,  the Year 2000 could affect the ability of consumers to use the PC
based  products  sold by the  Company.  If the  computer  systems  on which  the
consumers  use  the  Company's  products  are  not  Year  2000  compliant,  such
noncompliance could affect the consumers ability to use such products.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE

Future operating results of the Company depend upon many factors and are subject
to  various  risks  and  uncertainties.   Some  of  those  important  risks  and
uncertainties  which may cause the Company's  operating results to vary or which
may  materially  and  adversely  affect the Company's  operating  results are as
follows:

The Industry and Competition. The interactive software business has historically
been a volatile and highly  dynamic  industry  affected by changing  technology,
limited  hardware  platform life cycles,  hit products,  competition,  component
supplies, seasonality, consumer spending and other economic trends. The business
is also  intensely  competitive.  A variety of  companies  offer  products  that
compete  directly  with  one or more of the  Company's  products.  These  direct
competitors  vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial,
managerial  and technical  resources  comparable to or greater than those of the
Company.  Typically,  the Company's chief competitor on dedicated game platforms
is the  hardware  manufacturer/licensor  itself,  to which the Company  must pay
royalties,  and in the case of Sony and  Nintendo,  manufacturing  charges.  For
example,  Sony has  aggressively  launched  sports  product  lines that directly
compete with the  Company's  sports  products on the  PlayStation.  In addition,
competition  for  creative  talent  has  intensified,  and  the  attraction  and
retention of key personnel by the Company is increasingly difficult.

Products.  Interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans
of only 3 to 12 months. In addition, the packaged goods market is crowded with a
large number of titles  competing for limited retail shelf space.  The Company's
future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce
new competitive products on a timely basis and, in the packaged goods market, to
get those products  distributed widely at retail. To compete  successfully,  new
products must adapt to new hardware  platforms and emerging industry  standards,
provide additional content and functionality and be successfully  distributed in
numerous changing worldwide markets. If the Company were unable, due to resource
constraints or  technological  or other  reasons,  to  successfully  develop and
distribute  such  products  in a timely  manner,  this  inability  would  have a
material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition.

Development.  Product  development  schedules,  particularly  for  new  hardware
platforms  and high-end  multimedia  PCs are  difficult to predict  because they
involve creative  processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms and
the learning process,  research and experimentation  associated with development
for new technologies.  CD-ROM products  frequently  include more content and are
more  complex,  time-consuming  and costly to develop  and,  accordingly,  cause
additional development and scheduling risk than earlier generation products. For
example, Dungeon Keeper,  originally scheduled to ship in the quarter ended June
1996,  shipped  during the summer of 1997. In addition  Populous 3 for PC-CD and
PlayStation  were scheduled for shipment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998
and are now  expected to ship in the fiscal year ending  March 31,  1999.  Also,
SimCity  3000,  the follow on product to SimCity  2000,  was expected to ship in
fiscal 1998, at the time of the merger with Maxis. Due to additional development
delays,  it is anticipated  that this product will ship during the first half of
the fiscal year  ending  March 31,  1999.  Additionally,  development  risks for
CD-ROM  products  can cause  particular  difficulties  in  predicting  quarterly
results because brief  manufacturing  lead times allow  finalizing  products and
projected release dates late in a quarter.  The Company's  revenues and earnings
are dependent on its ability to meet its product release  schedule.  Its failure
to meet those  schedules  could result in revenues and earnings which fall short
of analysts' expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

Platform Changes. A large portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the
sale of products  designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms such
as the  PlayStation  and the N64.  The  interdependent  nature of the  Company's
business  and that of its hardware  licensors  brings  significant  risks to the
Company's  business.  The success of the  Company's  products  is  significantly
affected by market  acceptance  of the new video game  hardware  systems and the
life span of older hardware  platforms,  and the Company's ability to accurately
predict these factors with respect to each platform.  In many cases, the Company
will have  expended a large amount of  development  and  marketing  resources on
products  designed for new video game systems (such as the new 32-bit and 64-bit
systems) that have not yet achieved large installed bases or will have continued
product  development  for older  hardware  platforms  that may have shorter life
cycles than the Company expected.  Conversely, if the Company does not choose to
develop  for  a  platform  that  achieves  significant  market  acceptance,   or
discontinues  development  for a  platform  that has a longer  life  cycle  than
expected,  the Company's revenue growth may be adversely affected.  For example,
the Company has only  released  three  products  for the N64 through  March 1998
since the  introduction  of this platform in September 1996.  Additionally,  the
Company is  developing a line of EA SPORTS and other N64 products for release in
fiscal 1999.

The  Company  believes  that  investment  in  products  for the  32-bit  market,
including both PC-CD and CD-video game platforms  (particularly the PlayStation)
was  strategically  important in  positioning  the Company for the now completed
transition  to 32-bit  machines.  The  Company  continues  to believe  that such
investment is important and will continue its aggressive  development activities
for 32-bit platforms.  Although the PlayStation has achieved  significant market
acceptance in all  geographic  territories,  there can be no assurance  that its
growth will  continue at the present  rates.  The market  acceptance of the N64,
particularly in North

                                       28
<PAGE>
America  and  Europe,  may  adversely  affect  the  growth  rate  of the  32-bit
CD-platforms.

Multiplayer  Online  Gaming.   While  the  Company  does  not  currently  derive
significant  revenues from online games,  the Company  believes that multiplayer
online gaming will become a more  significant  factor in the Company's  business
and in the interactive gaming business  generally in the future.  Online gaming,
and particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as the Company's Ultima Online
product,  has at least four general areas of risk not currently  associated with
most packaged good sales.  First,  the speed and reliability of the internet and
the performance of the players'  internet service provider are not controlled by
the Company but impact game  performance.  Second,  in  "massively  multiplayer"
games such as Ultima Online,  unanticipated player conduct significantly affects
the  performance  of the game,  and social  issues  raised by  players'  conduct
frequently determine player  satisfaction.  The Company's ability to effectively
proctor such games is uncertain.  Third,  the current  business  model is as yet
experimental  and maybe  unsustainable;  whether  revenues  will  continue to be
sufficient to maintain the significant support,  service and product enhancement
demands of online  users is  uncertain.  The  Company has little  experience  in
pricing  strategies  for online  games or in  predicting  usage  patterns of its
customers.  Finally,  the legal  standards that may apply to online products are
uncertain; the Company has recently been sued in a class action lawsuit alleging
defects in Ultima Online,  regulation of the internet and the content it carries
is  regularly  proposed by various  legislators,  and piracy of online  games is
difficult to prosecute under existing  intellectual property laws. The viability
of this segment,  generally, and the Company's ability to compete in the segment
will depend  significantly  on these and other  factors  outside  the  Company's
control.

Hardware Companies.  The Company's contracts with hardware licensors,  which are
also some of the Company's chief competitors, often grant significant control to
the licensor over the manufacturing of the Company's products.  This fact could,
in  certain  circumstances,  leave  the  Company  unable  to  get  its  products
manufactured  and  shipped  to  customers.   In  most  events,  control  of  the
manufacturing  process by hardware  companies  increases both the  manufacturing
lead times and the  expense to the  Company  as  compared  to the lead times and
costs that the Company can achieve  independently.  For example, the Company, in
prior years,  experienced  delays in the  manufacturing of PlayStation  products
which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The results of future periods
may be affected by similar  delays.  Finally,  the Company's  contracts with its
hardware  licensors  often  require  the  Company to take  significant  risks in
holding or prepaying for its inventory of products. In particular, the Company's
agreement  with  Nintendo  for  N64  products  requires   prepayment  of  costly
cartridge-based inventory, minimum orders and no rights of return.

Revenue and Expenses.  A  substantial  majority of the revenue of the Company in
any quarter  typically  results from orders received and products  introduced in
that quarter.  The Company's  expenses are based,  in part,  on  development  of
products to be released in the future.  Certain overhead and product development
expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues.  This trend is increasing
as the Company increases the proportion of products developed  internally.  As a
result, the Company's  quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict,
and small delays in product deliveries may cause quarterly  revenues,  operating
results  and net income to fall  significantly  below  anticipated  levels.  The
Company typically  receives orders shortly before  shipments,  making backlog an
unreliable  indicator of quarterly  results. A shortfall in shipments at the end
of any  particular  quarter  may  cause  the  results  of that  quarter  to fall
significantly short of anticipated levels.

Gross  Margins.  Gross margins for the Company's  products as a whole  decreased
over the last year. The Company  expects that margins may be consistent  with or
decline from fiscal 1998 levels for several reasons.  First, the mix in sales of
the  Company's  products  has a  significant  effect  on gross  margins.  If the
proportion of AL revenues  continues to increase in relation to other  revenues,
margins may continue to decline.  Similarly,  as the Company  releases  more N64
products,  which carry  significantly  lower  margins due to high cost of goods,
overall gross margins may continue to decline.  Further,  gross margins continue
to be affected by  increases  in  professional  and  celebrity  license fees and
royalties.  Also,  while the costs of development of new products for 32-bit and
64-bit  systems  have  increased,  overall  costs  of  goods  are not  declining
significantly.  For products on  platforms  for which the Company is required to
purchase its goods from the hardware companies, the Company is unable to achieve
cost  reductions  through  manufacturing  efficiencies,  and in  addition,  pays
manufacturing royalties to hardware companies. Additionally,  retailers continue
to require significant price protection for products.  With an increasing number
of  titles  available  for  advanced  platforms,  such  requirements  for  price
protection may increase.  The Company also anticipates that retail and wholesale
prices for interactive entertainment products may decrease and gross margins may
be further adversely affected.

Marketing and  Distribution.  Both the video game and PC businesses  have become
increasingly  "hits"  driven.  Additional  marketing and  advertising  funds are
required to drive and support  "hit"  products,  particularly  expenditures  for
television advertising. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue
to produce "hit" titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

Employees.  Competition  for  employees  in the  interactive  software  business
continues to be intense.  Large software and media  companies  frequently  offer
significantly  larger cash compensation than does the Company,  placing pressure
on the 

                                       29

<PAGE>

 Company's  base  salary  and cash  bonus  compensation.  Small  start-up
companies  such as  those  proliferating  in the  online  business  areas  offer
significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies
like the  Company  to match  without  significant  stockholder  dilution.  While
executive turnover has decreased in fiscal 1998 as compared to prior years, many
key executives continue to experience intense recruiting pressure.  There can be
no  assurance  that the  Company  will be able to continue to attract and retain
enough qualified employees in the future.

Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations. For the 1998 fiscal year, international
net revenues  comprised  43% of total  consolidated  net  revenues.  The Company
expects  foreign  sales to  continue to account  for a  significant  and growing
portion  of the  Company's  revenues.  Such  sales  are  subject  to  unexpected
regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales
are  primarily  made in local  currencies  which may  fluctuate.  As a result of
current  economic  conditions  in Asia,  the  Company is  subject to  additional
foreign  currency  risk.   Though  the  Company  does  not  currently  derive  a
significant  portion of revenues  and  operating  profits from sales in Asia and
other developing countries, the Company's foreign currency exposure may increase
as the Company's  operations  in these  countries  grow and if current  economic
trends in Asia  continue.  There can be no assurance that these or other factors
will not have an adverse effect on the Company's future operating results.

Investments  in  Affiliates.  The Company has a number of equity  investments in
affiliates,  including small developers, such as Firaxis; other publishers, such
as  Accolade,  Inc.  and  NovaLogic,  Inc.;  and  new  ventures  such  as  Mpath
Interactive.  Additionally,  the  Company  has an equity  investment  in The 3DO
Company.  These  companies  are  generally  small  and may not have  significant
financial  resources.  Financial  difficulties  for any of these companies could
cause a reduction in the value of the Company's investment.

Fluctuations in Stock Price.  Due to analysts'  expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock in
any given period. As a result of the factors discussed in this annual report and
other  factors that may arise in the future,  the market price of the  Company's
common  stock  historically  has  been,  and  may  continue  to  be  subject  to
significant  fluctuations over a short period of time. These fluctuations may be
due to  factors  specific  to the  Company,  to changes  in  analysts'  earnings
estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment,  media
or  electronics  industries or the securities  markets in general.  For example,
during  the  fiscal  years  1998 and 1997 the price  per share of the  Company's
common   stock  ranged  from  $20.13  to  $46.94  and  from  $24.75  to  $39.13,
respectively.

Seasonality.  The Company's  business is highly seasonal.  The Company typically
experiences its highest  revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end  holiday
season and a seasonal low in revenues and profits in the quarter ending in June.


Because  of the  foregoing  factors,  as well as  other  factors  affecting  the
Company's operating results and financial condition,  past financial performance
should  not be  considered  a  reliable  indicator  of future  performance,  and
investors  should not use historical  trends to anticipate  results or trends in
future periods.

ITEM 8:  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

The Report of Independent Auditors,  Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements follow below on pages 31 through 48.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Electronic Arts Inc. and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets of Electronic Arts
Inc.  and  subsidiaries  as  of  March  31,  1998  and  1997,  and  the  related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the years in the three-year  period ended March 31, 1998. These  consolidated
financial  statements are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements  based on our audits.  We did not audit the  financial  statements of
Maxis,  Inc.,  a  company  acquired  by  Electronic  Arts  Inc.  in  a  business
combination  accounted  for as a pooling of interests as described in Note 10 to
the consolidated  financial  statements,  which statements  reflect total assets
constituting 12 percent as of March 31, 1997, and total revenues  constituting 7
percent and 9 percent for the years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively,
of the related  consolidated  totals.  Those  statements  were  audited by other
auditors whose report has been  furnished to us, and our opinion,  insofar as it
relates to the amounts  included for Maxis,  Inc., is based solely on the report
of the other auditors.

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We  believe  that our  audits  and the  report of the other  auditors  provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion,  based on our audits and the report of the other  auditors,  the
consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above  present  fairly,  in all
material   respects,   the  financial  position  of  Electronic  Arts  Inc.  and
subsidiaries as of March 31, 1998 and 1997, and the results of their  operations
and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year  period ended March
31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

ELECTRONIC ARTS AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

March 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996

(1)  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Consolidation
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Electronic Arts Inc. and its wholly-owned and  majority-owned  subsidiaries (the
"Company").  All significant  intercompany  balances and transactions  have been
eliminated in consolidation.

     A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation
of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company follows:

(a)  Fiscal Year
The  Company's  fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week  period that ends on the
Saturday  nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
1998 and 1997  contain 52 weeks and fiscal  1996  contains  53 weeks.  Since the
results of an additional week are not material, and for clarity of presentation,
all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a calendar month.

(b)  Revenue Recognition
Product  Sales:  Revenue is recognized  when the product is shipped.  Subject to
certain  limitations,  the Company permits  customers to obtain exchanges within
certain  specified  periods and  provides  price  protection  on certain  unsold
merchandise.  Revenue is  recognized  net of  allowances  for  returns and price
protection.

Software Licenses: For those agreements which provide the customers the right to
produce  multiple  copies in exchange for guaranteed  minimum  royalty  amounts,
revenue is recognized at delivery of the product  master or the first copy.  Per
copy royalties on sales that exceed the guarantee are recognized as earned.

Revenue  from the  licensing  of  software  was  $15,431,000,  $26,749,000,  and
$32,221,000  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1998,  1997  and  1996,
respectively.

(c)   Cash and Investments
Cash equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with  insignificant rate
risk  and  with  maturities  of three  months  or less at the date of  purchase.
Short-term  investments  include  securities with maturities  greater than three
months  and less than one year,  except  for  certain  investments  with  stated
maturities greater than one year.  Long-term  investments  consist of securities
with maturities greater than one year.

The Company  accounts for investments  under  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards  No.  115,  Accounting  for  Certain  Investments  in Debt and  Equity
Securities,  ("SFAS 115").  The Company's  policy is to protect the value of its
investment  portfolio and to minimize principal risk by earning returns based on
current interest rates. Management determines the appropriate  classification of
its debt and equity  securities  at the time of purchase  and  reevaluates  such
designation  as of each balance sheet date.  Debt  securities  are classified as
held-to-maturity  when the Company has the  positive  intent and ability to hold
the  securities  to maturity.  Securities  classified  as  held-to-maturity  are
carried at amortized  cost,  which is adjusted for  amortization of premiums and
accretion of discounts to maturity.  Such  amortization  is included in interest
income.  Debt  securities not classified as  held-to-maturity  are classified as
available  for  sale and are  stated  at fair  value  which  approximates  cost.
Securities sold is based on the specific identification method.

(d)  Prepaid Royalties
Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year.

(e)  Software Development Costs
Research and development costs, which consist primarily of software  development
costs, are expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
86  provides  for the  capitalization  of  certain  software  development  costs
incurred  after  technological  feasibility  of the software is  established  or
development costs that have alternative future uses. Under the Company's current
practice of  developing  new  products,  the  technological  feasibility  of the
underlying   software  is  not  established  until   substantially  all  product
development is complete,  which generally  includes the development of a working
model.  The software  development  costs that have been capitalized to date have
been insignificant.

(f)  Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories at March 31,
1998 and 1997 consisted of:

==============================================================
                                         1998        1997

                                          (in thousands)
Raw materials and work in process        $ 2,392      $ 4,714
Finished goods                            17,234       13,159
- --------------------------------------------------------------
                                         $19,626      $17,873
- --------------------------------------------------------------

(g)  Outside Production Costs
The  Company  defers the  outside  production  costs of the film  content of its
products.  Such  costs are  expensed  as cost of goods  sold based on actual net
product  sales.  Film costs deferred as of March 31, 1998 and 1997 were $757,000
and $926,000, respectively.

(h) Advertising costs
The  Company  generally  expenses  advertising  costs as  incurred,  except  for
production  costs associated with media campaigns which are deferred and charged
to expense at the first run of the ad. Cooperative advertising with distributors
and  retailers is accrued when revenue is  recognized.  Cooperative  advertising
credits are reimbursed  when  qualifying  claims are  submitted.  For the fiscal
years  ended  March  31,  1998,  1997 and  1996,  advertising  expenses  totaled
approximately $55,090,000, $36,159,000 and $31,160,000, respectively.

(i)  Property and Equipment
Property  and  equipment  are  stated at cost.  Depreciation  of  furniture  and
equipment is computed  using the  declining  balance  method over the  estimated
useful lives of the  respective  assets,  which range from three to seven years.
Depreciation  on new  management  information  systems  is  computed  using  the
straight-line  method over the estimated useful lives of the respective  assets,
which range from four to seven years.  Buildings are being depreciated using the
straight line method over 20 years.  Amortization  of leasehold  improvements is
computed  using the declining  balance method over the lesser of the lease terms
or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

(j)  Intangible Assets
Intangible  assets net of amortization at March 31, 1998 and 1997 of $2,148,000,
and  $1,115,000,  respectively,  are  included in other  current and  noncurrent
assets  and  include  goodwill,   costs  of  obtaining  product  technology  and
noncompete covenants which are amortized using the straight line method over the
lesser of their estimated useful lives or the agreement terms, typically no more
than seven  years.  Amortization  expense for fiscal years ended March 31, 1998,
1997 and 1996 was $692,000, $654,000, and $740,000, respectively.

(k)  Income Taxes
Income tax expense is based on reported  earnings before income taxes.  Deferred
income taxes  reflect the impact of  temporary  differences  between  assets and
liabilities  recognized  for  financial  reporting  purposes  and  such  amounts
recognized for tax purposes.

(l)  Foreign Currency Translation
For each of the Company's  foreign  subsidiaries the functional  currency is its
local currency. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into
U.S.  dollars  using  current  exchange  rates,  and  revenues  and expenses are
translated  into U.S.  dollars  using  average  exchange  rates.  The effects of
foreign  currency  translation  adjustments  are  deferred  and  included  as  a
component of stockholders' equity.

Foreign  currency  transaction  gains and  losses  are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions  denominated in currencies  other than the
functional currency.  Included in interest and other income in the statements of
income  are  foreign   currency   transaction   gains  (losses)  of  ($517,000),
($1,024,000),  and $433,000, for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively.

(m)   Net Income Per Share
In February 1997, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standards No 128, "Earnings per Share" ("SFAS 128"). SFAS
128 requires dual  presentation  of basic earnings per share ("EPS") and diluted
EPS for all entities with complex capital  structures.  Basic EPS is computed as
net earnings divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the  potential  dilution  that could occur
from common shares issuable  through  stock-based  compensation  plans including
stock  options,   restricted  stock  awards,   warrants  and  other  convertible
securities  using the  treasury  stock  method.  The  following  summarizes  the
computation  of Basic EPS and  Diluted  EPS (in  thousands  except for per share
amounts):

Earnings Per Share:

  Basic                         $1.23       $0.89       $0.84
  Diluted                       $1.19       $0.86       $0.80

The number of anti-dilutive shares excluded from the diluted EPS computation was
137,000,  623,000 and 1,081,000 for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1998,  1997
and 1996, respectively.

(n)  Employee Benefits
The Company has a 401(k) Plan covering  substantially all of its U.S. employees.
The 401(k)  Plan  permits  the Company to make  discretionary  contributions  to
employees'  accounts based on the Company's financial  performance.  The Company
contributed  $902,000,  $925,000 and $600,000 to the Plan in fiscal 1998, fiscal
1997 and fiscal 1996, respectively.

(o)  Stock-based Compensation
The Company  accounts for  stock-based  awards to employees  using the intrinsic
value method in  accordance  with  Accounting  Principles  Board Opinion No. 25,
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25").

(p)  Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130 ("SFAS 130"), "Reporting Comprehensive
Income",  which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive
income and its components  (revenues,  expenses,  gains and losses) in financial
statements.  SFAS 130 requires  classification  of items of other  comprehensive
income in a  financial  statement  and  display  of other  comprehensive  income
separately from retained  earnings and additional  paid-in capital.  The Company
will adopt SFAS 130 in its 1999 fiscal year.

In June 1997, FASB also issued Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards No.
131 ("SFAS  131"),  "Disclosures  About  Segments of an  Enterprise  and Related
Information",  which  establishes  standards  pertaining  to  disclosures  about
products and services,  geographic  areas, and major customers in its annual and
interim  financial  statements.  SFAS 131 also  requires  that public  companies
report  certain  financial  and  descriptive  information  about its  reportable
operating segments. The Company will adopt SFAS 131 in its 1999 fiscal year.

The  Accounting  Standards  Executive  Committee  of the  American  Institute of
Certified Public Accountants recently issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2,
"Software Revenue Recognition" effective for transactions entered into in fiscal
years  beginning  after  December 15,  1997.  SOP 97-2  supersedes  SOP 91-1 and
provides  guidance on  applying  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  in
recognizing  revenue on software  transactions.  The Company will adopt SOP 97-2
effective April 1, 1998 and expects  adoption will not have a material effect on
the Company's historical revenue recognition practices.

(q)  Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the  reported  amounts  of assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of
contingent  assets and  liabilities at the date of the financial  statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Such
estimates  include   provisions  for  doubtful   accounts,   sales  returns  and
allowances,  warranty provisions,  and estimates regarding the recoverability of
prepaid royalty  advances and inventory.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

(r)  Reclassifications
Certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 1998 presentation.

- --------------------------------------------------------------

Long-term  investments include commercial notes with maturities of five to eight
years secured by U.S.  Treasury Notes which enable the Company to take advantage
of certain tax incentives in its Puerto Rico  operation.  Long-term  investments
are  treated  as  held-to-maturity  for  financial  reporting  purposes.   Other
long-term investments have maturities of two years or less.



                                       38
<PAGE>

The fair value of held-to-maturity  securities at March 31, 1998 was $41,326,000
which included gross unrealized gains of $27,000 and gross unrealized  losses of
$7,000.  The fair value of  held-to-maturity  securities  at March 31,  1997 was
$53,842,000 which included gross unrealized gains of $206,000.

(b)  Marketable Securities

Marketable  securities  are  comprised  of equity  securities.  The  Company has
accounted for investments in equity securities as  "available-for-sale"  and has
stated applicable  investments at fair value,  with net unrealized  appreciation
reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.  Marketable securities
had an aggregate  cost of $1,143,000  and $1,559,000 at March 31, 1998 and 1997,
respectively. At March 31, 1998, marketable securities included gross unrealized
gains of $2,771,000 and gross unrealized  losses of $193,000.  At March 31, 1997
marketable  securities  included gross  unrealized gains of $4,174,000 and gross
unrealized losses of $185,000.

For the fiscal years ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, the fair value of marketable
securities sold was $7,276,000 and $21,152,000, respectively. The gross realized
gains from these sales totaled  $4,098,000  and  $8,393,000  for fiscal 1998 and
1997,  respectively.  The gain on sale of  investments  is based on the specific
identification method.

(c) Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts

The Company  utilizes  foreign  currency  forward  exchange  contracts  to hedge
foreign  currency market exposures of underlying  assets,  liabilities and other
obligations,  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in
foreign  currencies . The Company does not use forward  exchange  contracts  for
speculative or trading  purposes.  The Company's  accounting  policies for these
instruments  are  based on the  Company's  designation  of such  instruments  as
hedging  transactions.   The  criteria  the  Company  uses  for  designating  an
instrument as a hedge include the  instrument's  effectiveness in risk reduction
and   one-to-one   matching  of  forward   exchange   contracts  to   underlying
transactions. Gains and losses on currency forward contracts that are designated
and  effective as hedges of firm  commitments  are deferred  and  recognized  in
income in the same period that the underlying  transactions  are settled.  Gains
and losses on currency  forward  contracts  that are designated and effective as
hedges of existing  transactions  are recognized in income in the same period as
losses and gains on the  underlying  transactions  are  recognized and generally
offset. Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria would
be recognized in income in the current period. The Company transacts business in
various foreign currencies,  including European  currencies.  At March 31, 1998,
the Company had foreign  exchange  contracts,  all with  maturities of less than
nine months, to sell approximately $26,000,000 in British Pounds and to purchase
approximately  $22,800,000,  $11,000,000,  $10,600,000 and $4,300,000 in British
Pounds,  German  Deutschmarks,  Italian  Liras  and other  European  currencies,
respectively.

The difference  between the face value and fair value,  based on spot rates,  of
these contracts is not significant.  The  counterparties  to these contracts are
substantial  and credit  worthy  multinational  commercial  banks.  The risks of
counterparty  nonperformance  associated with these contracts are not considered
to be material.


(3)  COMMITMENTS

Lease Obligations
The  Company  leases  its  current   facilities  and  certain   equipment  under
non-cancelable  operating  lease  agreements.  The  Company is  required  to pay
property  taxes,  insurance  and  normal  maintenance  costs for  certain of its
facilities and will be required to pay any increases over the base year of these
expenses on the remainder of the Company's facilities.

In  February  1995,  the  Company  entered  into a master  operating  lease,  as
subsequently  amended,  for land and a building  to be  constructed  in Redwood
City,  California.  The initial term of the lease is for a period of three years
from the earlier of the date of completion  of  construction  or December  1998.
Monthly lease  payments are based upon the London  Interbank  Offered Rate.  The
Company has the option to purchase  the property  for the  unamortized  financed
balance at any time after the non-cancelable lease term, or it may terminate the
lease at any time after the non-cancelable  term by arranging a third party sale
or by making a  termination  payment.  Should the Company elect to terminate the
lease, it will guarantee a residual value of up to 85% of the unamortized  value
of the  property.  As part of the  agreement,  the Company must also comply with
certain financial covenants.

Total future minimum lease commitments as of March 31, 1998 are:

Total rent expense for all operating  leases was $13,842,000,  $11,430,000,  and
$8,652,000,  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  March  31,  1998,  1997  and  1996,
respectively.

<PAGE>

represents  the  obligation  accrued for rent,  calculated on the  straight-line
method over the lease term and is included in accrued liabilities.

(4)  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The  Company  extends  credit  to  various  companies  in the  retail  and  mass
merchandising  industry.  Collection  of trade  receivables  may be  affected by
changes in economic or other industry  conditions and may,  accordingly,  impact
the  Company's  overall  credit risk.  Although the Company  generally  does not
require  collateral,  the Company  performs  ongoing  credit  evaluations of its
customers and reserves for potential credit losses are maintained.

The  Company  had no sales to any one  customer  in  excess  of 10% of total net
revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996.

Short-term   investments   are  placed   with  high   credit-quality   financial
institutions or in short-duration  high quality  securities.  The Company limits
the  amount of credit  exposure  in any one  institution  or type of  investment
instrument.

(5)  LITIGATION

The  Company  is subject to pending  claims and  litigation.  Management,  after
review and  consultation  with counsel,  considers  that any liability  from the
disposition of such lawsuits  would not have a material  adverse effect upon the
consolidated financial condition of the Company.

(6)  PREFERRED STOCK

At March 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had 1,000,000  shares of Preferred Stock
authorized  but  unissued.  The rights,  preferences,  and  restrictions  of the
Preferred  Stock may be  designated  by the Board of Directors  without  further
action by the Company's stockholders.

(7)  STOCK PLANS

(a)  Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The  Company  has an Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan  program  whereby  eligible
employees may authorize payroll deductions of up to 10% of their compensation to
purchase shares at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Common Stock
on the date of  commencement of the offering or on the last day of the six-month
purchase  period.  The program  commenced  in  September  1991.  In fiscal 1998,
199,680  shares were  purchased by the Company and  distributed  to employees at
prices  ranging  from  $26.14 to $26.19.  In fiscal  1997,  184,596  shares were
purchased by the Company and  distributed  to  employees at prices  ranging from
$21.25 to $25.18.  In fiscal 1996,  154,516 shares were purchased by the Company
and  distributed to employees at prices ranging from $15.09 to $21.57 per share.
The weighted average fair value of the fiscal 1998,  fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996
awards was $9.43, $10.41 and $8.81, respectively. At March 1998, the Company had
228,958 shares of its Common Stock reserved for future issuance under the Plan.

Prior to the  Maxis  merger in July  1997,  Maxis  employees  were  eligible  to
participate in an employee  stock purchase plan. In fiscal 1998,  1997 and 1996,
Maxis purchased 7,684,  18,220 and 8,017 shares,  respectively,  under this plan
which were  distributed  to  participating  employees.  Shares were purchased at
prices  ranging from $27.70 to $27.99 in fiscal 1998, $28.56 to $46.08 in fiscal
1997, and $37.32 in fiscal 1996.

(b)  Stock Option Plans
The Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan,  1993 Stock Option Plan, 1995 Stock Option
Plan and Directors'  Plan ("Option  Plans") provide stock options for employees,
officers and independent contractors, and for directors, respectively.  Pursuant
to these  Option  Plans,  the Board of  Directors  may grant  non-qualified  and
incentive stock options to employees and officers and  non-qualified  options to
celebrities,  employees of certain  companies in which the Company has an equity
investment, and directors, at not less than the fair market value on the date of
grant.

The options  generally expire ten years from the date of grant and are generally
exercisable in monthly increments over 50 months.

In connection with the Maxis merger,  the Company  established the 1993 and 1995
Stock  Option Plans  ("Maxis  Plans") and assumed and  transferred  all existing
obligations  under Maxis' existing stock option plans. The obligations  included
immediate  vesting  of grants to  certain  employees  due to a change in control
provision.  Options  under the Maxis Plans  generally  expire ten years from the
date of grant,  and vest and  become  exercisable  at a rate of 25% on the first
anniversary of the date of grant and 25% of the shares each year thereafter.

The Company has adopted the disclosure-only provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting  Standards No. 123,  Accounting for Stock Based  Compensation  ("SFAS
123").  Accordingly,  no  compensation  expense has been  recognized for options
granted under the Company's  employee based stock option plans. Had compensation
expense  been  determined  based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards
under those plans in accordance  with the  provisions of SFAS 123, the Company's
pro forma net income and net  income  per share for fiscal  1998,  1997 and 1996
would have been:

The fair value of each option  grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes  option-pricing model. The following weighted-average  assumptions
used for grants  made in 1998,  1997 and 1996 under the stock  plans:  risk-free
interest  rates of 5.31% to 6.42% in 1998;  5.48% to 6.36% in 1997; and 5.12% to
6.25% in 1996; expected  volatility of 58% in each of the three years;  expected
lives in each of the three  years of 2.25 years  under the Option  Plans and one
year for the Employee  Stock  Purchase  Plan.  No  dividends  are assumed in the
expected  term.  The  Company's  calculations  are  based on a  multiple  option
valuation  approach and forfeitures  are recognized  when they occur.  The above
disclosures  include  options  granted under the former Maxis option plans as if
they were initially granted by the Company.

Because SFAS 123 is applicable only to options  granted  subsequent to March 31,
1995, the impact of non-vested stock options granted prior to this date has been
excluded from the pro forma calculation.  Accordingly, pro forma adjustments are
not  indicative of future period pro forma  adjustments  as the pro forma effect
will not be fully reflected until subsequent years.

(10)  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND DIVESTITURE

(a)   Maxis, Inc.
On July 25, 1997, the Company completed a merger with Maxis, Inc.  ("Maxis"),  a
California-based   interactive   software  developer.   Under  the  transaction,
approximately  4.1 million  shares of Electronic  Arts' stock were exchanged for
all  outstanding  Maxis common  stock.  The  transaction  was accounted for as a
pooling of interests. The accompanying financial statements,  notes and analyses
have been restated for all periods presented to reflect this transaction.

In  conjunction  with  the  merger  of  Maxis,  the  Company  recorded  costs of
$10,792,000.  This  charge  included  direct  transaction  fees  for  investment
bankers,  attorneys,  accountants,  and  other  related  costs of  approximately
$2,781,000  and costs  associated  with  integrating  the  operations of the two
companies of approximately  $8,011,000.  Included in the integration  costs were
redundant facility costs,  severance payments,  equipment  abandonment costs and
other  asset  write  downs,  contract  termination  charges  and  other  related
expenses.  Of the total merger costs,  approximately  $5,185,000 related to cash
expenditures while approximately $5,607,000 related to noncash charges. At March
31,  1998,  there were no accruals  remaining  related to these  merger  related
costs.

Total net  revenue and net income  (loss) for the  individual  entities  for the
fiscal years ended March 31, 1997 and 1996 are as follows (in thousands):

  Net income (loss)             53,002     (1,675)       51,327

- ----------------------------------------------------------------
1996
- ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Net revenue                 $531,887     $55,412     $587,299
  Net income                    40,489       6,188       46,677

(b)  Electronic Arts Victor, Inc.
In December 1997, the Company  acquired the remaining 35% ownership  interest in
Electronic Arts Victor, Inc. ("EAV") from Victor Entertainment Industries,  Inc.
("VEI") for  approximately  $3,225,000 in cash. As a result of the  acquisition,
the joint  venture has become a  wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company and has
been renamed Electronic Arts, K.K. ("EAJ"). The acquisition was accounted for as
a step acquisition purchase and the excess purchase price over fair value of the
net tangible assets acquired was allocated to purchased  in-process  technology,
goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets.  The  Company  incurred  a  charge  to
operations of $1,500,000 for the acquired  in-process  technology as of the date
of  the  acquisition  after  concluding  that  the  related  technology  had  no
alternative  future use after taking into  consideration the potential for usage
of the software in different products and resale of the software.

The goodwill and other intangible  assets of  approximately  $1,700,000 is being
amortized over 7 years.  The results of operations  reflect a minority  interest
elimination  through  the date of the  acquisition.  Prior  to the  acquisition,
minority  interest for the year ended March 31, 1998  reflects only a 


                                       43

portion of EAV's losses,  as VEI's  interest in the net equity of EAV had fallen
below zero.

(c)  Creative Wonders, LLC
In December 1997, the Company  completed the sale of its 50% ownership  interest
Creative  Wonders,  LLC, a joint  venture  company  formed  with the Walt Disney
Company  (formerly  Capital  Cities / ABC,  Inc.) for  $16,750,000  in cash. The
Company  recognized  a gain of  $12,625,000,  which is included in interest  and
other income. Prior to the sale, the Company distributed  children's interactive
titles  published  and sold by the joint  venture into the retail  channel.  The
investment was accounted for under the equity method prior to sale.

The valuation  allowance  relates  solely to the foreign loss and foreign credit
carryforwards, for which the utilization is uncertain in future periods.

At March 31, 1998, the Company had federal net operating loss  carryforwards  in
the amount of $6,000,000.

The  differences  between  the  statutory  income  tax  rate  and the  Company's
effective tax rate,  expressed as a percentage  of income  before  provision for
income taxes, for the years ended March 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 were as follows:

The  Company  provides  for  U.S.  taxes  on an  insignificant  portion  of  the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and does not provide taxes on
the remainder.  At March 31, 1998,  the  undistributed  foreign  earnings of the
foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately  $118,000,000.  If these earnings
were  distributed to the parent  company,  foreign tax credits  available  under
current law would substantially eliminate the resulting Federal tax liability.

The Company's  manufacturing  subsidiary in Puerto Rico operates  under a Puerto
Rican  tax  incentive  program  which  grants  the  Company  certain  percentage
exemptions  from Puerto Rican income,  property and municipal taxes for a period
of 20 years  from the  date of the  commencement  of  operations.  The U.S.  tax
benefit  derived  for the  years  ended  March  31,  1998,  1997  and  1996  was
approximately  $31,000,  $600,000,  and  $411,000,  respectively.  The U.S.  tax
benefit of Puerto Rico  operations is not expected to be  significant  in future
years.  Long-term  reinvestment in Puerto Rico of the undistributed  earnings of
the Puerto Rico subsidiary  enables the Company to take advantage of certain tax
incentives.

(13) DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following  methods and  assumptions  were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value:

Cash,  short-term  investments,   receivables,   accounts  payable  and  accrued
liabilities - the carrying amount  approximates  fair value because of the short
maturity of these instruments.

Long-term investments, investments classified as held-to-maturity and marketable
securities - fair value is based on quoted market prices.

                  DESCRIPTION OF REGISTRANT'S FISCAL YEAR 1999
                              EXECUTIVE BONUS PLAN




Target  annual  bonuses are set for each  executive  based upon a percentage  of
salary.  Bonuses  are  paid  in two  parts,  one of  which  relates  only to the
Company's earnings results, and the second part is discretionary and is measured
against each individual  executive's  contributions.  Bonuses are paid after the
end of the fiscal year.  If profits in any period are less than 90% of plan,  no
bonus based on the  Company's  performance  is paid for that period.  If profits
exceed  plan by up to 20% during a period,  the bonus  rate is  doubled  for the
incremental  profits  above plan.  If profits  exceed plan by more than 20%, the
bonus rate is tripled for profits in excess of 120% of plan.

                                                                   Exhibit 99.01

                REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Maxis, Inc.

         We have audited the consolidated  balance sheet of Maxis, Inc. at March
31, 1997, and the related consolidated  statements of operations,  stockholders'
equity  (deficit),  and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended
March 31, 1997 (not presented separately herein). These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

         We conducted our audits in accordance with generally  accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

         In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Maxis,  Inc. at March 31, 1997, and the  consolidated  results of its operations
and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 1997,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                                                               ERNST & YOUNG LLP

Walnut Creek, California
May 5, 1997, except for Note 14 as to which 
the date is
June 4, 1997
