                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The consolidated  financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments
(consisting  only  of  normal  recurring  accruals)  that,  in  the  opinion  of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
period.  The  results  of  operations  for the  current  interim  period are not
necessarily  indicative  of results to be expected  for the current  year or any
other period.  Certain  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the fiscal
2000 presentation.

These consolidated  financial  statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated  financial statements and notes thereto included in Electronic Arts
Inc. (the "Company")  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 1999 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  ("Commission") on
June 29, 1999.

Note 2. Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included
in other current  assets,  was $57,993,000 and $35,057,000 at September 30, 1999
and March 31, 1999,  respectively.  The long-term portion of prepaid  royalties,
included in other assets,  was  $14,829,000 and $7,602,000 at September 30, 1999
and March 31, 1999, respectively.

Note 6. Comprehensive Income

In fiscal  1999,  the Company  adopted  SFAS No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive
Income,"  which   establishes   standards  for  reporting  and  the  display  of
comprehensive income and its components (revenues,  expenses,  gains and losses)
in financial statements. SFAS 130 requires classification of other comprehensive
income in a  financial  statement  and  display  of other  comprehensive  income
separately  from  retained  earnings  and  additional  paid-in  capital.   Other
comprehensive income includes primarily foreign currency translation adjustments
and unrealized gains (losses) on investments.

Note 7. Earnings Per Share

<TABLE>
The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method (in thousands except per share amounts):

Due to the net loss  reported for the three and six months ended  September  30,
1998, stock options have been excluded from the Diluted EPS calculation. Had net
income been reported in these periods,  dilutive  potential  common shares would
have been 63,425,000 and 63,208,000 for the three and six months ended September
30, 1998. Excluded from the computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted
EPS were  options to purchase  81,000 and 40,000  shares of common stock for the
three and six months ended  September  30, 1998,  respectively,  as the options'
exercise price was greater than the average market price of the common shares.

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
were  options to purchase  41,000,  and 556,000  shares of common  stock for the
three and six months ended  September  30, 1999,  respectively,  as the options'
exercise  price was greater than the average  market price of the common shares.
For the three and six months  ended  September  30, 1999,  the  weighted-average
exercise price of the respective options was $66.87 and $59.66, respectively.


Note 8.  New Accounting Pronouncement

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is  effective  as of the  beginning  of the first  quarter  of the  fiscal  year
beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company is determining the effect of SFAS 133
on its financial statements.

North America Net Revenues

The  increase in North  America net  revenues for the three and six months ended
September 30, 1999,  compared to the same periods last year was primarily due to
increased  sales of PC-CD and AL products.  For the three months ended September
30, 1999, PC-CD revenues  increased 55% as compared to the same period last year
due to strong sales of Command & Conquer  Tiberian Sun. For the six months ended
September  30,  1999,  PC-CD  sales  increased  81% due to the  shipment  of key
releases  such as Command & Conquer  Tiberian Sun and catalog  sales of Sim City
3000 which was  released in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  1999.  North  America
affiliated label product  revenues  increased 83% for the three months ended and
86%  for  the  six  months  ended  September  30,  1999,  primarily  due  to the
distribution of Final Fantasy VIII published by Square EA, a joint venture which
began in the second quarter of last year.

International Net Revenues

The increase in international  net revenues for the three months ended September
30, 1999,  compared to the same period last year was primarily  attributable  to
the success of Command & Conquer  Tiberian  Sun for the PC-CD in Europe and Asia
Pacific.  European  PC-CD sales  increased  over 300% and Asia Pacific  sales of
PC-CD product  increased over 200%. Japan net revenues  increased as compared to
the same  period  last year  primarily  due to  catalog  sales of Sim City 3000,
Dungeon Keeper 2 and Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf on PC-CD and higher AL product
sales.  Additionally,  all  international  territories  had weak second  quarter
revenues last year due to few significant product releases in the quarter.

For the six months  ended  September  30, 1999,  the increase in European  PC-CD
sales was partially  offset by a decrease in PlayStation  and N64 sales,  mainly
attributable  to the shipment of World Cup 98 in the prior year. The increase in
Asia  Pacific  was  primarily  due to higher  PC-CD  sales  related to Command &
Conquer  Tiberian  Sun,  higher  Playstation  sales due to the  shipment  of two
locally developed titles in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, offset
by lower  sales of AL product.  The  decrease in Japan was due to lower sales of
PlayStation  products due to the  shipment of FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98 in the
prior year.

PlayStation Product Net Revenues

We released seven  PlayStation  titles during both the second quarters of fiscal
2000 and fiscal 1999,  including Madden NFL. PlayStation sales increased for the
three  months  ended  September  30, 1999  compared to the prior year  primarily
attributable to the greater installed base of PlayStation  consoles,  as well as
the  release of a new  franchise  title,  WCW Mayhem.  For the six months  ended
September 30, 1999 PlayStation  revenues  decreased due to the shipment of World
Cup 98 in the prior year. We expect revenues from  PlayStation  products to grow
in fiscal 2000, but as revenues for these products increase, we do not expect to
maintain the same growth rates as those in the prior years.

Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, we are
authorized to develop and distribute  CD-based software products compatible with
the  PlayStation.  Pursuant  to the Sony  Agreement,  we  engage  Sony to supply
PlayStation CDs for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability to
control our supply of PlayStation  CD products or the timing of their  delivery.
See Risk  Factors  - "Our  platform  licensors  are our  chief  competitors  and
frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products", below.

Personal Computer CD Product Net Revenues

We released  six PC-CD titles in the second  quarter of the current  fiscal year
compared to nine for the same period last year.  The  increase in sales of PC-CD
products for the three and six months ended September 30, 1999 was  attributable
to key  releases  during the  quarter,  principally  the  shipment  of Command &
Conquer  Tiberian  Sun.  Additionally,  the  increase  for the six months  ended
September  30, 1999 was also due to strong  catalog  sales of titles such as Sim
City 3000.  This  increase was  partially  offset by the prior year  shipment of
World Cup 98. We expect revenues from PC-CD products to grow in fiscal 2000, but
we do not expect to maintain the current growth rates.

N64 Product Net Revenues

We released four N64 titles in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 compared to two
titles  during the same period last year.  The  increase in N64 revenues for the
three months ended September 30, 1999, compared to the same period last year was
primarily due to releases during the quarter including WCW Mayhem.  The decrease
for the six months ended  September 30, 1999 was due to the release of World Cup
'98 in fiscal  1999.  We do not expect  significant  growth in revenues  for N64
products in fiscal 2000.

Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64
cartridges  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have  little  ability to
control our supply of N64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery. A shortage
of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to
obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.

In connection  with our purchases of N64  cartridges for  distribution  in North
America,  Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to
Nintendo's  acceptance  of  purchase  orders  from  us for  purchases  of  these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk. See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our
chief  competitors and frequently  control the  manufacturing  of our video game
products", below.

Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues

The increase in Affiliated Label net revenues for the three and six months ended
September  30, 1999  compared to the same periods last year was primarily due to
the  distribution  of Final Fantasy VIII in North America.  European AL revenues
also  increased  for  the  six  months  ended  September  30,  1999  due  to the
acquisition of ABC Software in Switzerland in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.
We expect  revenues from AL products to continue to grow in fiscal 2000,  but as
revenues for these products increase,  we do not expect to maintain these growth
rates.

Cost of goods  sold as a  percentage  of net  revenues  decreased  for the three
months ended  September 30, 1999 compared to the same period last year primarily
due to increased  sales of higher margin PC-CD products as compared to the prior
year.  For the six months  ended  September  30,  1999,  cost of goods sold as a
percentage  of revenues  decreased  due to an increase in sales of higher margin
PC-CD products and higher sales of internally developed titles such as Command &
Conquer  Tiberian Sun, Sim City 3000, and Dungeon Keeper 2 offset by an increase
in sales of lower margin AL products as compared to the prior year.

The increase in marketing and sales  expenses for the three and six months ended
September 30, 1999 was primarily attributable to increased television, print and
Internet   advertising  to  support  new  releases  and  increased   cooperative
advertising  associated  with  higher  revenues  in Europe  and  North  America.
Marketing and sales expenses also increased due to additional headcount expenses
related to the continued expansion of our worldwide distribution business.

General and administrative expenses increased for the three and six months ended

including  six months of  expenses in 1999 for ABC, which was  acquired  in July
1998.

In connection  with the  acquisition of Westwood in September 1998, we allocated
and  expensed   $41,836,000  of  the  purchase  price  to  acquired   in-process
technology.  Additionally,  in connection  with the  acquisition of two software
development companies,  in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, we incurred a total
charge of $2,279,000 for acquired in-process technology. These charges were made
after we concluded that the in-process  technology had not reached technological
feasibility  and had no alternative  future use after taking into  consideration
the potential for usage of the software in different  products and resale of the
software.

</TABLE>

The  decrease in interest  and other  income,  net,  for the three  months ended
September  30,  1999  was  primarily  due to lower  gains on sale of  marketable
securities  in the current  year,  partially  offset by higher  interest  income
attributable  to  investments  in longer term  securities,  with  maturities  no
greater than three years, resulting in higher interest rates. Interest and other
income, net, increased for the six months ended September 30, 1999 due to a gain
on sale of minority  interest in an  affiliate  in the  current  year  partially
offset by lower  interest  income as compared to the same period last year.  For
both the three and six  months  ended  September  30,  1999  interest  and other
income,  net, increased due to EA's share in the net income of Square Electronic
Arts, LLC as compared to the same periods last year.

</TABLE>

The Company's  effective  tax rate for the three and six months ended  September
30, 1998 was  negatively  affected as there was no tax  benefit  recorded  for a
portion of the charges related to the acquired in-process technology.  Excluding
the effect of these charges, the effective tax rate for the three and six months
ended September 30, 1998 would have been 33.0%. The Company's effective tax rate
for the  three and six  months  ended  September  30,  1999 was  lower  than the
comparable  prior year period,  excluding the effect of the charges in the prior
year,  primarily  as a result of a  projected  higher  portion of  international
income for fiscal  2000  subject to a lower  foreign tax rate as compared to the
prior year.

</TABLE>

The increase in net income for the three and six months ended September 30, 1999
is primarily  related to the charges for acquired  in-process  technology in the
prior year.  Excluding the one time charges in the prior year,  net income would
have been  $10,706,000  for the three months and  $15,933,000 for the six months
ended  September 30, 1998. The increase in net income,  excluding the prior year
one time  charges,  was due to higher  revenues and gross profits as compared to
the same periods last year partially offset by higher operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of  September  30, 1999,  our working  capital was  $374,707,000  compared to
$333,256,000  at  March  31,  1999.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments  decreased by approximately  $88,478,000 during the six months ended
September 30, 1999 as we used $103,839,000 of cash in operations and $47,283,000
in capital  expenditures,  offset by  $42,987,000  provided  through the sale of
equity  securities under our stock plans as well as proceeds from the sale of an
affiliate and the sale of marketable securities.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns decreased from $72,850,000 at March 31,
1999 to  $64,767,000  at  September  30,  1999.  Reserves  have been charged for
returns of product and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in
prior  periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves  are  adequate  based  on
historical  experience  and  its  current  estimate  of  potential  returns  and
allowances.

Our principal  source of liquidity is $224,344,000 in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements on both a short-term
and long-term basis.

Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure

Background of Year 2000 Issues

Many currently  installed  computer systems and software  products are unable to
distinguish  between  twentieth  century  dates and  twenty-first  century dates
because such systems may have been  developed  using two digits rather than four
to determine  the  applicable  year.  For example,  computer  programs that have
date-sensitive  software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather
than  the  year  2000.   This  error   could   result  in  system   failures  or
miscalculations  causing  disruptions  of  operations,  including,  among  other
things, a temporary inability to process  transactions,  send invoices or engage
in similar normal business activities. As a result, many companies' software and
computer  systems  may need to be upgraded or replaced to comply with such "Year
2000" requirements.

State of Readiness

Our  business is  dependent  on the  operation  of numerous  systems  that could
potentially be impacted by Year 2000 related  problems.  Those systems  include,
among  others:  hardware  and software  systems used to deliver  products to our
customers;  communications  networks such as the Internet and private intranets,
upon which we depend to receive orders from our customers;  the internal systems
of our customers  and  suppliers;  products sold to customers;  the hardware and
software  systems  used  internally  in  the  management  of our  business;  and
non-information  technology  systems and services used in the  management of our
business, such as power, telephone systems and building systems.

As a third party providing software  products,  we are dependent on the hardware
and software  products  used to deliver  such  products  and  services.  If such
products  are  inoperable  due to Year  2000  issues,  our  business,  financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. An inventory of
our internal  business  systems,  and software and hardware  upgrades  have been
completed to ensure Year 2000 compliance.

Costs

To date we have not incurred  significant  costs  directly  related to Year 2000
issues,  even in cases where non-compliant  information  technology systems were
redeployed or replaced.

                                       19
<PAGE>

We believe that future expenditures to upgrade internal systems and applications
will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of  operations  and are  primarily  included  within our ongoing  system
development  plan.  In  addition,  while  the  potential  costs  of  redeploying
personnel and of any delays in  implementing  other projects are not known,  the
costs are anticipated to be immaterial.

Risks of the Year 2000 Issues

Our  financial  information  systems  include an  integrated  suite of  business
applications  developed and supported by Oracle Corporation.  These applications
systems are in place and currently support daily operations in North America and
in Europe.  Based on  representations  made by Oracle  Corporation  and upon our
limited tests, we believe these systems to be Year 2000 compliant.

We believe our software  products are Year 2000 compliant;  however,  success of
our Year 2000  compliance  efforts  may depend on the  success of our  customers
dealing with their Year 2000 issues. Customer difficulties with Year 2000 issues
might require us to devote additional  resources to resolve underlying problems.
Failures of our computer systems or third parties' computer systems could have a
material  adverse  impact on our ability to conduct  business.  For  example,  a
significant  percentage  of purchase  orders  received  from our  customers  are
computer generated and electronically  transmitted.  In addition,  the Year 2000
could  affect the  ability of  consumers  to use our PC based  products.  If the
computer  systems  on which the  consumers  use our  products  are not Year 2000
compliant,  such  noncompliance  could affect the consumers' ability to use such
products.

Contingency Plans

We  continue  to  assess  certain  of our Year 2000  exposure  areas in order to
determine what additional  steps beyond those  identified by our internal review
in the United States are  advisable.  We have  developed a contingency  plan for
handling Year 2000  problems that are not detected and corrected  prior to their
occurrence.   We  believe  that  the  systems,  which  represent  the  principal
exposures, have been identified, and to the extent necessary, are in the process
of being modified to become Year 2000 compliant. Additionally, we have conducted
tests of our  principal  business  systems to verify that those systems are Year
2000  compliant.  Any failure to address any  unforeseen  Year 2000 issues could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Euro Conversion

On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union
established  fixed  conversion  rates between  their  existing  currencies  (the
"legacy  currency") and the one common legal currency known as the "Euro".  From
January 1, 1999  through June 30, 2002 the  countries  will be able to use their
legacy  currencies  or the Euro to transact  business.  By July 1, 2002,  at the
latest,  the  conversion  to the Euro will be  complete at which time the legacy
currencies will no longer be legal tender.  The fixed  conversion  rates between
their existing  currencies have eliminated exchange rate risk between the member
countries.

The  conversion to the Euro has reduced the number of forward  contracts that we
use to hedge the exchange  rate risk.  The forward  contracts  that were used to
hedge the individual legacy currencies have been replaced by a single Euro hedge
contract  and  the  intercompany  transactions  among  subsidiaries  within  the
European Union are no longer subject to exchange rate risk.

We do not  anticipate  any  material  impact  from  the Euro  conversion  on our
financial  information systems which currently  accommodate multiple currencies.
Computer  software  changes  necessary  to comply  with the Year 2000 issues are
generally compliant to the Euro conversion issue. Due to numerous uncertainties,
we cannot  reasonably  estimate the effect that the Euro  conversion  issue will
have on our pricing or market  strategies,  and the impact, if any, it will have
on our financial condition and results of operations.

Risk Factors

EA's  business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties  which may affect our
future financial  performance.  Some of those important risks and  uncertainties
which may cause  our  operating  results  to vary or which  may  materially  and
adversely affect our operating results are as follows:

- - Product  development  schedules are frequently  unreliable and make predicting
quarterly results difficult. Product development schedules, particularly for new
hardware platforms and high-end  multimedia PCs are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms
and  the  learning  process,   research  and  experimentation   associated  with
development  for new  technologies.  For example,  SimCity  3000,  the follow on
product to SimCity 2000, was expected to ship in fiscal 1998, at the time of the
merger with Maxis. Due to additional  development  delays,  that product did not
ship until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1999. Also, Tiberian Sun, which was
expected  to ship in  fiscal  1999 at the time of the  acquisition  of  Westwood
Studios,  was not  released  until the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2000 due to
development  delays.  Additionally,  development  risks for CD-ROM  products can
cause  particular  difficulties  in predicting  quarterly  results because brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter.  Our revenues  and  earnings are  dependent on our ability to
meet our product  release  schedules,  and our  failure to meet those  schedules
could result in revenues and earnings which fall short of analysts' expectations
for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

- - New video game  platforms  create  additional  technical  and  business  model
uncertainties.  A large  portion of our  revenues  are derived  from the sale of
products for play on proprietary  video game  platforms such as the  PlayStation
and the N64. The success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance
of the new video  game  hardware  systems  and the life  span of older  hardware
platforms and our ability to accurately  predict  which  platforms  will be most
successful.

Sometimes we will spend development and marketing resources on products designed
for new video game systems that have not yet achieved large  installed  bases or
will continue  product  development  for older hardware  platforms that may have
shorter  life cycles than we  expected.  Conversely,  if we do not develop for a
platform that achieves significant market acceptance, or discontinue development
for a platform that has a longer life cycle than  expected,  our revenue  growth
may be adversely affected.

For  example,  we have no  products  under  development  for the Sega  Dreamcast
console,  which  has  already  launched  in the  United  States  and  in  Japan.
Accordingly,  we will not have products  available  should this platform achieve
wide market acceptance. Similarly, we intend to launch a variety of products for
the new Sony PlayStation  platform,  the PlayStation II, expected to be released
in the United States in the fall of 2000.  Should that platform not achieve wide
acceptance by  consumers,  we will have spent a  disproportionate  amount of our
resources for this platform.  Additionally,  we have not  negotiated  publishing
agreements with Sony, Sega or Nintendo for their next generation platforms,  and
we do not know whether the terms of those agreements will be favorable.

- - The  business  models and  technology  for  e-commerce  and online  gaming are
unproven.  While we do not  currently  derive  significant  revenues from online
sales of our packaged products or from games played online, we believe that both
will become a more  significant  factor in our business  and in the  interactive
gaming business generally in the future.

E-commerce is becoming an  increasingly  popular method for conducting  business
with consumers.  How that form of distribution  will affect the more traditional
retail distribution,  at which we have historically excelled, and over what time
period, is uncertain.  Additionally,  technology, staffing and support for sales
direct to consumers differ from that required for sales to resellers.

                                       21
<PAGE>

Online gaming,  and  particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as our Ultima
Online product,  has many risks not currently associated with most packaged good
sales including, but not limited to, the following:

In "massively  multiplayer"  games such as Ultima Online,  unanticipated  player
conduct  significantly  affects the  performance  of the game, and social issues
raised by players' conduct frequently determine player satisfaction.
Our ability to effectively proctor such games is uncertain.

The  current  business  model is as yet  experimental  and maybe  unsustainable;
whether  revenues will  continue to be  sufficient  to maintain the  significant
support,  service and product  enhancement demands of online users is uncertain.
We  have  little  experience  in  pricing  strategies  for  online  games  or in
predicting usage patterns of our customers.

Additionally, the speed and reliability of the Internet and the performance of a
user's  Internet  service  provider  are not  controlled  by us but impact  both
e-commerce and online game performance. Whether the Internet infrastructure will
be  adequate  to meet  increasing  demand  will  affect our  ability to grow our
Internet dependent businesses.

- - Our business,  our products,  and our  distribution  are subject to increasing
regulation in key territories.  Legislation is increasingly introduced which may
affect the content of our products and their distribution.  For example, privacy
rules in the United States and Europe  impose  various  restrictions  on our web
sites. Those rules vary by territory while of course the Internet  recognizes no
geographical  boundaries.  Other  countries  such as Germany  have  adopted laws
regulating content  transmitted over the Internet that are stricter than current
United  States laws. In the United  States,  in response to recent  events,  the
federal and several state  governments are considering  content  restrictions on
products such as those made by us as well as  restrictions  on  distribution  of
such products. Any one or more of these factors could harm our business.

- - Our platform  licensors are our chief  competitors and frequently  control the
manufacturing  of  our  video  game  products.   Our  agreements  with  hardware
licensors,  which are also our chief  competitors,  typically  give  significant
control to the licensor  over the approval and  manufacturing  of our  products.
This fact could, in certain  circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products
approved,  manufactured and shipped to customers. In most events, control of the
approval and manufacturing  process by the platform licensors increases both our
manufacturing  lead  times  and  costs  as  compared  to  those  we can  achieve
independently.  For example,  in prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining
approvals for and  manufacturing of PlayStation  products which caused delays in
shipping  those  products.  The  potential  for  additional  delay or refusal to
approve or manufacture our products continues with our platform licensors.  Such
occurrences   would  harm  our  business  and  adversely  affect  our  financial
performance.

- - We face intense  competition for talent from highly valued Internet companies.
Competition for employees in the interactive  software business  continues to be
intense. Recently, the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining key
employees is from Internet companies.  The high market valuations,  large equity
positions  for  key  executives  and  other  employees  and  fast  stock   price
appreciation of these companies make their compensation  packages  attractive to
those who are already working in more mature  companies.  This situation creates
difficulty  for us to compete for the  attraction and retention of executive and
key creative talent.

                                       22
<PAGE>
- - Foreign Sales and Currency  Fluctuations.  For the six months ended  September
30, 1999,  international  net revenues  comprised 38% of total  consolidated net
revenues.  For the fiscal year ended March 31, 1999,  international net revenues
comprised 42% of total  consolidated  net revenues.  We expect  foreign sales to
continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenues.  Such
sales are  subject to  unexpected  regulatory  requirements,  tariffs  and other
barriers.  Additionally,  foreign sales are primarily  made in local  currencies
which may  fluctuate.  As a result of current  economic  conditions  in Asia, we
continue to monitor our foreign currency risk. Though we do not currently derive
a significant  portion of revenues and operating  profits from sales in Asia and
other  developing  countries,  our foreign  currency  exposure  may  increase as
operations in these countries grow. Any of these factors may significantly  harm
our business.

- - Fluctuations in Stock Price. Due to analysts' expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given
period.  As a result of the factors  discussed in this report and other  factors
that may arise in the future,  the market price of our common stock historically
has been,  and may  continue to be subject to  significant  fluctuations  over a
short period of time.  These  fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us,
to  changes  in  analysts'  earnings  estimates,  or to  factors  affecting  the
computer,  software,  entertainment,  media  or  electronics  industries  or the
securities markets in general.  For example,  during the fiscal year ended March
31,  1999,  the price per share of our common stock ranged from $33.88 to $56.00
and from $45.63 to $76.19 during the six months ended September 30, 1999.

Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Item 3:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk


Market Risk

         We are  exposed to  various  market  risks,  including  the  changes in
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Market risk is the potential
loss arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts
used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short-term  investments are subject
to market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject
to  interest  rate risk due to their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies,  thereby,  limiting our risk. Gains
and losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.
At September 30, 1999, we had foreign exchange contracts, all with maturities of
less than six months to purchase and sell approximately  $187,514,000 in foreign
currencies, primarily British Pounds, European Currency Units ("Euro"), Canadian
Dollars, Japanese Yen and other currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and  the  forward  rate,   plus  the  unamortized   premium  or  discount.   The
counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational
commercial banks. The risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these
contracts  are not  considered  to be material.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to
manage  foreign  exchange  risks,  there can be no  assurances  that our hedging
activities will adequately  protect us against the risks associated with foreign
currency fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts at September  30, 1999.  The  information  is provided in U.S.  dollar
equivalents  and presents the notional  amount  (forward  amount),  the weighted
average  contractual  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  fair  value.  All
contracts mature within six months.

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.


Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are  typically  able to hold our  investments  to maturity.  At September 30,
1999, our cash equivalents,  short-term and long-term  investments included debt
securities of $159,699,000.  Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate
risks,  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately  protected against
the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

The table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates
of our investment portfolio at September 30, 1999:

                                   Average

                            STANDARD LEASE PROVISIONS

1.  Premises.  Landlord  hereby  leases to Tenant and Tenant  hereby leases from
Landlord,  subject to all of the terms and  conditions  set forth herein,  those
certain premises (the "Premises")  described in the Basic Lease  Information and
as outlined in red or as shown in the  cross-hatched  markings on the floor plan
attached  hereto as Exhibit "B". The Premises are located in that certain office
building (the  "Building")  whose street  address is as shown in the Basic Lease
Information. The Building is located on that certain land which is also improved
with landscaping,  parking  facilities and other improvements and appurtenances.
Such  land,  together  with  all such  improvements  and  appurtenances  and the
Building,  are all or part of a  project  which  may  consist  of more  than one
building and additional facilities,  as described in the Basic Lease Information
(collectively referred to herein as the "Project").  However,  Landlord reserves
the right to make such changes,  additions  and/or  deletions to such land,  the
Building and the Project and/or the common areas and parking  facilities thereof
as it shall determine from time to time.

2.       Term.

         (a) Unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions hereof,
the term of this Lease  (the  "Term")  shall be as set forth in the Basic  Lease
Information; provided, however, in the event the Term Commencement Date (defined
below)  occurs on a date  other than the first day of a  calendar  month,  there
shall be added to the Term the partial  month  ("Partial  Lease Month") from the
Term  Commencement  Date to (but not  including)  the first day of the  calendar
month following the Term Commencement Date.

         (b)  Subject  to the  provisions  of this  Paragraph  2, the Term shall
commence on the date (the "Term Commencement  Date") which is the earlier of (i)
the date  Landlord  delivers  the  Premises  to  Tenant  based  upon the City of
Carlsbad's  approval for occupancy  for Tenant's  Permitted Use (ii) or the date
Tenant takes  possession or commences use of any portion of the Premises for any
business  purpose   (including  moving  in).  If  this  Lease  contemplates  the
construction of tenant improvements in the Premises by Landlord,  Landlord shall
be deemed  to have  delivered  the  Premises  to  Tenant on the date  reasonably
determined by Landlord's space planner to be the date of substantial  completion
of the  work to be  performed  by  Landlord  (as  described  in the  Improvement
Agreement,   if  any,   attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  "C")  (the   "Improvement
Agreement").  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  in the event  that  Landlord  is
delayed in  delivering  the Premises by reason of any act or omission of Tenant,
the Term Commencement Date shall be (unless Tenant takes possession or commences
use of the  Premises  prior  thereto)  the date the  Premises  would  have  been
delivered by Landlord had such Tenant caused  delay(s) not occurred.  This Lease
shall be a binding  contractual  obligation  effective upon execution  hereof by
Landlord and Tenant,  notwithstanding the later commencement of the Term. Tenant
acknowledges that Tenant has inspected and accepts the Premises in their present
condition, "as is", except for tenant improvements (if any) to be constructed by
Landlord in the Premises pursuant to the Improvement Agreement, if any.

         (c) In the event the Term  Commencement  Date is delayed  or  otherwise
does not occur on the  Scheduled  Term  Commencement  Date,  within one  hundred
eighty (180) days of issuance of the building permit by the City of Carlsbad for
the Tenant  Improvements  pursuant to Exhibit C, then Tenant, upon not less than
thirty  (30) days  prior  written  notice to  Landlord  shall  have the right to
terminate this Lease, unless within such thirty (30) day period Landlord tenders
possession  of the Premises in the condition  required by this Lease.  Except as
otherwise  provided herein,  this Lease shall not be void or voidable,  the Term
shall not be extended  (except as provided in Paragraph 2(a), and Landlord shall
not be liable to Tenant  for any loss or damage  resulting  therefrom;  provided
that  Tenant  shall not be liable  for any Rent  (defined  below) for any period
prior to the Term  Commencement Date except as may otherwise be provided in this
Lease. Landlord may deliver to Tenant Landlord's standard form "Start-Up Letter"
for Tenant's  acknowledgment  and  confirmation of the Term  Commencement  Date.
Tenant shall  execute and deliver such Start-Up  Letter to Landlord  within five
(5) days after receipt  thereof,  but Tenant's failure or refusal to do so shall
not negate Tenant's  acceptance of the Premises or affect  determination  of the
Term Commencement Date.

3.       Rent and Operating Expenses.

         3.1      Base Rent

         (a) Subject to the provisions of this  Paragraph 3.1,  Tenant agrees to
pay  during the Term as Base Rent for the  Premises  the sums  specified  in the
Basic  Lease  Information  (as  adjusted  from time to time as  provided in this
Lease) ("Base Rent").

         (b)  Base  Rent  shall  increase  as  set  forth  in  the  Basic  Lease
Information or as may otherwise be provided in this Lease.

         (c) Except as  expressly  provided to the  contrary  herein,  Base Rent
shall be payable in equal consecutive monthly installments,  in advance, without
deduction or offset,  commencing on the Term Commencement Date and continuing on
the first day of each calendar month thereafter. However, the first full monthly
installment of Base Rent shall be payable upon Tenant's execution of this Lease.
If the Term  Commencement  Date is a day other  than the first day of a calendar
month,  then the Rent for the  Partial  Lease  Month (the  "Partial  Lease Month
Rent") shall be prorated  based on a month of 30 days.  The Partial  Lease Month
Rent  shall be  payable  by Tenant on the first day of the  calendar  month next
succeeding the Term  Commencement  Date. Base Rent, all forms of additional rent
payable  hereunder by Tenant and all other  amounts,  fees,  payments or charges
payable  hereunder by Tenant shall (i) each  constitute  rent payable  hereunder
(and shall  sometimes  collectively  be referred  to herein as "Rent"),  (ii) be
payable to  Landlord in lawful  money of the United  States when due without any
prior  demand  therefor,  except as may be  expressly  provided to the  contrary
herein,  and (iii) be payable to Landlord at Landlord's  Remittance  Address set
forth in the Basic Lease  Information  or to such other  person or to such other
place as Landlord may from time to time designate in writing to Tenant.

         3.2      Operating Expenses.

         (a)  Subject  to the  provisions  of this  Lease,  Tenant  shall pay to
Landlord  pursuant to this  Paragraph 3.2 as additional  rent an amount equal to
Tenant's Proportionate Share (defined below) of the excess, if any, of Operating
Expenses  (defined  below)  allocable to each Expense Year (defined  below) over
Operating Expenses allocable to the Base Year (the "Base Year") specified in the
Basic  Lease   Information   ("Base   Year   Operating   Expenses").   "Tenant's
Proportionate  Share" is,  subject to the  provisions of this Paragraph 3.2, the
percentage  number  (representing  the  Premises'  share of the Building and the
Project)  set forth in the Basic Lease  Information.  An  "Expense  Year" is any
calendar year after the Base Year any portion of which falls within the Term.

<PAGE>

         (b)  "Operating  Expenses"  means all costs,  expenses and  obligations
incurred or payable by Landlord  because of or in connection with the operation,
ownership,  repair, replacement,  restoration,  management or maintenance of the
Project during or allocable to the Base Year or an Expense Year (as  applicable)
during the Term,  all as determined by sound  accounting  principles  reasonably
selected by Landlord and consistently applied,  including without limitation the
following:

                  (i) All property  taxes,  assessments,  charges or impositions
and  other  similar  governmental  ad  valorem  or other  charges  levied  on or
attributable  to the Project  (including  personal and real  property  contained
therein)  or its  ownership,  operation  or  transfer,  and all taxes,  charges,
assessments or similar impositions imposed in lieu or substitution (partially or
totally) of the same (collectively, "Taxes"). "Taxes" shall also include (A) all
taxes,  assessments,  levies, charges or impositions on any interest of Landlord
in the  Project,  the Premises or in this Lease,  or on the  occupancy or use of
space in the Project or the  Premises;  or on the gross or net rentals or income
from the Project;  or (B) any possessory taxes charged or levied in lieu of real
estate taxes.  Tenant shall not be liable for any increases in real estate taxes
as a result of a transfer of the Building during the initial five (5) year Lease
Term only. Taxes shall  specifically  exclude all federal income taxes,  federal
excise profit taxes, franchise,  capital stock and federal and state inheritance
or estate taxes; and

                  (ii) The cost of all utilities,  supplies,  equipment,  tools,
materials,  service contracts,  janitorial services,  waste and refuse disposal,
landscaping,  and insurance  (with the nature and extent of such insurance to be
carried by Landlord to be reasonably determined by Landlord based upon insurance
carried on similar  properties in the San Diego County); insurance  deductibles;
compensation and benefits of all persons who perform services connected with the
operation,  management,  maintenance or repair of the Project; personal property
taxes on and  maintenance  and repair of equipment and other personal  property;
costs and fees for  administration  and  management  of the Project,  whether by
Landlord  or  by  an  independent   contractor,   and  other  management  office
operational  expenses;  rental  expenses  for  or  a  reasonable  allowance  for
depreciation   of,  personal   property  used  in  the  operation,   management,
maintenance or repair of the Project,  license,  permit and inspection fees; and
all inspections, activities, alterations, improvements or other matters required
by any governmental or  quasi-governmental  authority or by Regulations (defined
below), for any reason,  including,  without limitation,  capital  improvements,
whether  capitalized or not; all capital  additions,  repairs,  replacements and
improvements  made to the  Project or any portion  thereof by Landlord  (A) of a
personal  property nature and related to the operation,  repair,  maintenance or
replacement  of  systems,  facilities,  equipment  or  components  of (or  which
service) the Project or portions thereof, (B) required or provided in connection
with any  existing  or future  applicable  municipal,  state,  federal  or other
governmental statutes, rules, requirements, regulations, laws, standards, orders
or ordinances including, without limitation,  zoning ordinances and regulations,
and   covenants,   easements   and   restrictions   of   record   (collectively,
"Regulations"), (C) which are designed to actually reduce the Operating Expenses
of the Project (with such capital  costs to be amortized  according to Generally
Accepted  Accounting  Principles  (GAAP)  over  the  entire  useful  life of the
improvement(s));  common area repair,  resurfacing,  replacement,  operation and
maintenance;  security  systems  or  services,  if any,  deemed  appropriate  by
Landlord  (but without  obligation  to provide the same);  and any other cost or
expense  incurred  or payable by  Landlord  in  connection  with the  operation,
ownership,  repair, replacement,  restoration,  management or maintenance of the
Project.

         (c)  Variable  items of Operating  Expenses  (e.g.,  expenses  that are
affected by variations  in occupancy  levels) for the Base Year and each Expense
Year during  which  actual  occupancy  of the  Project is less than  ninety-five
percent  (95%)  of the  rentable  area of the  Project  shall  be  appropriately
adjusted, in accordance with sound accounting principles, to reflect ninety-five
percent (95%) occupancy of the existing rentable area of the Project during such
period.

         (d) Prior to or shortly following the commencement of (and from time to
time during) each  calendar  year of the Term  following  the Term  Commencement
Date, Landlord shall give to Tenant a written estimate of Tenant's Proportionate
Share of the projected excess, if any, of the Operating Expenses for the Project
for such year over the Base Year Operating  Expenses.  Commencing with the first
day of the  calendar  month  following  the  month in which  such  estimate  was
delivered to Tenant,  Tenant shall pay such estimated  amount (less amounts,  if
any,  previously  paid  toward  such  excess for such year) to Landlord in equal
monthly installments over the remainder of such calendar year, in advance on the
first day of each month during such year (or remaining  months, if less than all
of the year remains).  Subject to the  provisions of this Lease,  Landlord shall
endeavor to furnish to Tenant  within a reasonable  period after the end of each
Expense  Year,  a  statement  (a  "Reconciliation   Statement")   indicating  in
reasonable  detail the excess, if any, of Operating  Expenses  allocable to such
Expense Year over Base Year  Operating  Expenses and the parties  shall,  within
forty-five  (45) days  thereafter,  make any payment or  allowance  necessary to
adjust  Tenant's  estimated  payments to Tenant's actual share of such excess as
indicated by such annual Reconciliation Statement.

         (e) Tenant  shall pay ten (10) days  before  delinquency  all taxes and
assessments  levied against any personal property or trade fixtures of Tenant in
or about the  Premises.  If any such taxes or  assessments  are  levied  against
Landlord  or  Landlord's  property  or if the  assessed  value of the Project is
increased by the inclusion therein of a value placed upon such personal property
or trade  fixtures,  Tenant  shall,  within ten (10) days of  demand,  reimburse
Landlord for the taxes and assessments so levied against  Landlord,  or any such
taxes,  levies and  assessments  resulting from such increase in assessed value.
Tenant's  obligations under this Paragraph 3.2(e) shall not extend more than one
(1) year following the termination of this Lease.

         (f) Any delay or failure of Landlord in (i)  delivering any estimate or
statement described in this Paragraph 3.2, or (ii) computing or billing Tenant's
Proportionate  Share of excess  Operating  Expenses  shall not (A)  constitute a
waiver of its right to  subsequently  deliver  such  estimate  or  statement  or
require any increase in Rent  contemplated  by this Paragraph 3.2, or (B) in any
way waive or impair the  continuing  obligations  of Tenant under this Paragraph
3.2.  Provided that Tenant is not then in default  under this Lease,  subject to
compliance with Landlord's  standard  procedures for the same, Tenant shall have
the right, at Tenant's  expense,  and upon the condition that Tenant shall first
pay to Landlord  the amount in dispute,  to have  independent  certified  public
accountants  of national  standing  (who are not  compensated  on a  contingency
basis) of Tenant's  selection  (and subject to Landlord's  reasonable  approval)
review  Landlord's  Operating  Expense books and records relating to the Expense
Year  subject to a  particular  Reconciliation  Statement  during the  sixty-day
period  following  delivery to Tenant of the  Reconciliation  Statement for such
Expense Year.  Tenant waives the right to dispute or contest,  and shall have no
right to dispute or contest, any matter relating to the calculation of Operating
Expenses or other forms of Rent under this  Paragraph  3.2 with  respect to each
Expense Year for which a Reconciliation Statement is given to Tenant if no claim
or dispute  with  respect  thereto is  asserted by Tenant in writing to Landlord
within  sixty (60) days of  delivery  to Tenant of the  original  or most recent
Reconciliation Statement with respect thereto.

4. Delinquent  Payment;  Handling Charges. In the event Tenant is more than five
(5) days late in paying any amount of Rent or any other  payment  due under this
Lease,  Tenant shall pay Landlord,  within ten (10) days of  Landlord's  written
demand therefor, a late charge equal

Page 3 of 22
<PAGE>

to five percent (5%) of the delinquent  amount, or $150.00,  whichever amount is
greater. In addition,  any amount due from Tenant to Landlord hereunder which is
not paid  within ten (10) days of the date due shall bear  interest at an annual
rate (the "Default Rate") equal to twelve percent (12%).

5. Security Deposit.  Contemporaneously with the execution of this Lease, Tenant
shall pay to Landlord the amount of Security  Deposit (the  "Security  Deposit")
specified  in the Basic  Lease  Information,  which shall be held by Landlord to
secure Tenant's  performance of its obligations  under this Lease.  The Security
Deposit  is not an advance  payment of Rent or a measure or limit of  Landlord's
damages  upon a default by Tenant or an Event of  Default  (defined  below).  If
Tenant  defaults with respect to any provision of this Lease,  Landlord may, but
shall not be required  to, use,  apply or retain all or any part of the Security
Deposit (a) for the payment of any Rent or any other sum in default, (b) for the
payment of any other  amount  which  Landlord  may spend or become  obligated to
spend by reason of such default by Tenant,  and (c) to  compensate  Landlord for
any other loss or damage which  Landlord may suffer by reason of such default by
Tenant.  If any portion of the  Security  Deposit is so used or applied,  Tenant
shall,  within ten (10) days after  demand  therefor by  Landlord,  deposit with
Landlord  cash in an amount  sufficient  to restore the Security  Deposit to the
amount required to be maintained by Tenant hereunder. Within a reasonable period
following  expiration  or the sooner  termination  of this Lease,  provided that
Tenant has performed all of its obligations hereunder,  Landlord shall return to
Tenant the remaining portion of the Security  Deposit.  The Security Deposit may
be commingled by Landlord with Landlord's  other funds, and no interest shall be
paid thereon. If Landlord transfers its interest in the Premises,  then Landlord
may assign the Security Deposit to the transferee and thereafter  Landlord shall
have no further  liability or obligation for the return of the Security Deposit.
Tenant hereby waives the provisions of Section  1950.7 of the  California  Civil
Code, and all other provisions of any Regulations,  now or hereinafter in force,
which  restricts  the amount or types of claim  that a landlord  may make upon a
security  deposit or imposes upon a landlord (or its  successors) any obligation
with respect to the handling or return of security deposits.

6.       Landlord's Obligations.

         6.1 Services.  Subject to the provisions of this Lease,  Landlord shall
furnish to Tenant  during the Term (a) city or  utility  company  water at those
points of supply  provided for general use of the tenants of the  Building;  (b)
subject to mandatory and  voluntary  Regulations,  heating and air  conditioning
during  ordinary  business  hours  (described  below) for the  Building  at such
temperatures  and  in  such  amounts  as  Landlord   reasonably   determines  is
appropriate  for normal  comfort for normal  office use in the  Premises  (after
hours HVAC is currently estimated to be $25.00 per hour, subject to change); (c)
janitorial  services to the Premises on weekdays,  other than on legal holidays,
for  Building-standard   installations;   (d)  nonexclusive  passenger  elevator
service.  If Tenant desires any of the services  specified in this Paragraph 6.1
at any time other than during  ordinary  business hours of generally  recognized
business days designated by Landlord for the Building (building hours are Monday
through Friday, 7:00 a.m. through 6:00 p.m and Saturday, 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.,
which in any event shall not include Saturdays, Sundays or legal holidays), then
subject to such  nondiscriminatory  conditions  and standards as Landlord  shall
apply to the same,  upon the written  request of Tenant,  such services shall be
supplied to Tenant in accordance  with Landlord's  customary  procedures for the
Building,  including  such advance  request  deadlines as Landlord shall require
from time to time,  and Tenant shall pay to Landlord  Landlord's  then customary
charge for such  services  within ten (10) days after  Landlord has delivered to
Tenant an invoice therefor.  Except, however, Landlord shall provide Tenant with
up to twenty  (20)  hours per month of after  hours  HVAC  usage at no charge to
Tenant.  Landlord  reserves  the right to change the supplier or provider of any
such  service  from time to time.  Tenant shall not have the right to obtain any
such  service  for the  Premises  directly  from a supplier  or provider of such
service except as provided in Paragraph 6.4 below or for its  separately-metered
electric  service to the Premises,  in which case tenant shall pay, upon demand,
for these utilities furnished to the Premises.

         6.2 Excess  Utility  Use.  Landlord  shall not be  required  to furnish
electrical  current for, and Tenant shall not install or use, without Landlord's
prior  written  consent,  any  equipment  whose  operation  is in excess  of, or
inconsistent  with, the capacity of the Building (or existing feeders and risers
to, or wiring in, the Premises).

         6.3 Restoration of Services.  Following  receipt of Tenant's request to
do so,  Landlord  shall restore any service  specifically  to be provided  under
Paragraph 6.1 that becomes  unavailable  and which is in  Landlord's  reasonable
control to restore; provided,  however, that in no case shall the unavailability
of such  services  or any other  service  (or any  diminution  in the quality or
quantity thereof) or any interference in Tenant's business operations within the
Premises  render  Landlord liable to Tenant or any person using or occupying the
Premises under or through Tenant (including, without limitation, any contractor,
employee,  agent, invitee or visitor of Tenant) (each, a "Tenant Party") for any
damages of any nature  whatsoever  caused  thereby,  constitute  a  constructive
eviction of Tenant,  constitute a breach of any implied warranty by Landlord, or
entitle Tenant to any abatement of Tenant's rental obligations hereunder.

         6.4  Telecommunications  Services.  Tenant may contract separately with
providers of  telecommunications  or cellular products,  systems or services for
the Premises. Even though such products, systems or services may be installed or
provided by such  providers in the Building,  in  consideration  for  Landlord's
permitting such providers to provide such services to Tenant, Tenant agrees that
Landlord  and the  Landlord  Indemnitees  (defined  below)  shall in no event be
liable to Tenant or any Tenant  Party for any  damages of any nature  whatsoever
arising out of or relating to the products, systems or services provided by such
providers (or any failure,  interruption,  defect in or loss of the same) or any
acts  or  omissions  of  such  providers  in  connection  with  the  same or any
interference in Tenant's business caused thereby. Tenant waives and releases all
rights and  remedies  against  Landlord and the  Landlord  Indemnitees  that are
inconsistent with the foregoing.

7.       Improvements, Alterations, Repairs and Maintenance.

         7.1 Improvements;  Alterations. Any alterations,  additions, deletions,
modifications or utility  installations in, of or to the improvements  contained
within the  Premises,  not  including  the Tenant  Improvements  as described in
Exhibit "C" attached hereto (collectively,  "Alterations") shall be installed at
Tenant's expense and only in accordance with detailed plans and  specifications,
construction  methods,  and all appropriate  permits and licenses,  all of which
have been previously submitted to and approved in writing by Landlord,  and by a
professionally  qualified and licensed contractor and subcontractors approved by
Landlord.  No  Alterations  in or to  the  Premises  may  be  made  without  (a)
Landlord's prior written consent and (b) compliance with such  nondiscriminatory
requirements  and  construction   regulations  concerning  such  Alterations  as
Landlord  may  impose  from  time  to  time.  Landlord  will  not be  deemed  to
unreasonably  withhold its consent to any Alteration that violates

Page 4 of 22
<PAGE>

Regulations,  may affect or be incompatible with the Building's structure or its
HVAC,   plumbing,   telecommunications,   elevator,   life-safety,   electrical,
mechanical or other basic  systems,  or the  appearance  of the interior  common
areas or  exterior  of the  Project,  or  which  may  interfere  with the use or
occupancy of any other portion of the Project.  All Alterations  made in or upon
the Premises shall, (i) at Landlord's option,  either be removed by Tenant prior
to the end of the Term (and Tenant  shall  restore  the portion of the  Premises
affected to its condition  existing  immediately prior to such  Alteration),  or
shall  remain on the  Premises at the end of the Term;  provided  however,  that
Landlord  shall  notify  Tenant in writing at the same time that it  consents to
such Alteration of its election of one of the above two options,  which election
shall be binding upon Landlord  notwithstanding  anything to the contrary stated
herein, (ii) be constructed, maintained, insured and used by Tenant, at its risk
and expense,  in a first-class,  good and workmanlike  manner, and in accordance
with all  Regulations,  and (iii)  shall be subject  to  payment  of  Landlord's
standard   alterations   supervision   fee,   except  for   non-structural   and
non-mechanical  alterations  costing  up to Five  Thousand  Dollars  ($5,000.00)
cumulatively.  If any  Alteration  made or  initiated  by Tenant or the  removal
thereof shall cause,  trigger or result in any portion of the Project outside of
the  Premises,  any  portion  of the  Building's  shell  and  core  improvements
(including restrooms, if any) within the Premises, or any Building system inside
or outside of the Premises  being required by any  governmental  authority to be
altered,  improved or removed, or may otherwise potentially affect such portions
of the  Project or any other  tenants of the  Project,  Landlord  shall have the
option (but not the obligation) of performing the same at Tenant's  expense,  in
which case  Tenant  shall pay to Landlord  (within  ten (10) days of  Landlord's
written demand) in advance  Landlord's  reasonable  estimate of the cost of such
work, and any actual costs of such work in excess of Landlord's  estimate,  plus
an  administrative  charge of ten percent (10%) thereof.  At least ten (10) days
before  beginning  construction  of any  Alteration,  Tenant shall give Landlord
written notice of the expected  commencement date of that construction to permit
Landlord  to post and record a notice of  non-responsibility.  Upon  substantial
completion of construction,  if the law so provides, Tenant shall cause a timely
notice of  completion to be recorded in the office of the recorder of the county
in which the Building is located.

7.2 Repairs and Maintenance.  Tenant shall maintain at all times during the Term
the Premises and all portions and  components  of the  improvements  and systems
contained therein in a first-class,  good, clean, safe, and operable  condition,
and shall not  permit or allow to remain  any waste or damage to any  portion of
the Premises, with the exception of reasonable wear and tear Tenant shall repair
or replace,  as needed,  subject to Landlord's  direction and  supervision,  any
damage to the Building or the Project caused by Tenant or any Tenant Party, with
the exception of reasonable  wear and tear. If any such damage occurs outside of
the  Premises or relates to any  Building  system,  then  Landlord  may elect to
repair  such  damage  itself  at  Tenant's  expense.  The cost of all  repair or
replacement  work  performed  by  Landlord  under this  Paragraph  7.2,  plus an
administrative charge of ten percent (10%) of such cost, shall be paid by Tenant
to  Landlord  within ten (10) days of receipt of  Landlord's  invoice  therefor.
Tenant  hereby  waives  all  common  law  and  statutory  rights  or  provisions
inconsistent herewith, whether now or hereinafter in effect (including,  without
limitation,  Sections 1941,  1941.1, and 1941.2 of the California Civil Code, as
amended  from time to time).  Landlord  shall  maintain  the common areas of the
Project in a  commercially  reasonable  manner at all times during the Term with
the cost thereof constituting an Operating Expense under Paragraph 3.2.

         7.3  Mechanic's  Liens.  Tenant  shall not cause,  suffer or permit any
mechanic's or materialman's  lien, claim, or stop notice to be filed or asserted
against  the  Premises,  the  Building  or any  funds of  Landlord  for any work
performed,  materials furnished,  or obligation incurred by or at the request of
Tenant  or any  Tenant  Party.  If any such  lien,  claim or  notice is filed or
asserted,  then Tenant shall,  within ten (10) days after Landlord has delivered
notice of the same to Tenant,  either (a) pay and  satisfy in full the amount of
(and eliminate of record) the lien,  claim or notice or (b)  diligently  contest
the same and deliver to Landlord a bond or other security  therefor in substance
and  amount  (and  issued  by an  issuer)  satisfactory  to  Landlord.  Tenant's
obligations  under  this  Paragraph  7.3  shall  not  apply  to any  work  to be
performed,  materials  furnished,  or  obligation  incurred  with respect to the
Tenant Improvements.

8. Use. Tenant shall  continuously  occupy and use the Premises only for general
office use or uses incidental thereto, all of which shall be consistent with the
standards  of a first  class  office  project  (the  "Permitted  Use") and shall
comply,  at  Tenant's  expense,  with  all  Regulations  relating  to  the  use,
condition,  alteration,  improvement,  access to, and  occupancy of the Premises
(including  the Palomar  over flight  restrictions  document  #1998-0362387,  as
recorded  on  June  15,  1998  and  resolution  nos.  4234  and  4244,  document
#1998-0362388,  as recorded on June 15,  1998),  including  without  limitation,
Regulations  relating  to  Hazardous  Materials  (defined  below).   Should  any
Regulation now or hereafter be imposed on Tenant or Landlord by any governmental
body  relating to the use or  occupancy  of the  Premises or the Project  common
areas by Tenant or any Tenant Party or concerning occupational, health or safety
standards for employers,  employees, or tenants, then Tenant agrees, at its sole
cost and expense,  to comply promptly with such  Regulations if such Regulations
relate to anything within the Premises or if compliance with such Regulations is
within the  control of Tenant and  applies to an area  outside of the  Premises.
Tenant  shall  conduct its  business and shall cause each Tenant Party to act in
such a manner as to (a) not  release  or permit  the  release  of any  Hazardous
Material in, under, on or about the Project in violation of any Regulations, (b)
use or store any Hazardous  Materials (other than incidental amounts of cleaning
and office  supplies)  in or about the  Premises or (c) not create or permit any
nuisance or  unreasonable  interference  with or disturbance of other tenants of
the  Project  or  Landlord  in its  management  of the  Project  or (d) not on a
continuing  basis,  create  any  occupancy  density in the  Premises  or parking
density with respect to Tenant and any Tenant Party at the Project  greater than
those specified in the Basic Lease Information.  "Hazardous  Material" means any
hazardous, explosive, radioactive or toxic substance, material or waste which is
or becomes regulated by any local,  state or federal  governmental  authority or
agency,  including,  without limitation,  any material or substance which is (i)
defined  or  listed  as  a  "hazardous  waste,"  "extremely   hazardous  waste,"
"restricted  hazardous  waste,"  "hazardous  substance,"  "hazardous  material,"
"pollutant" or "contaminant" under any Regulation,  (ii) a flammable  explosive,
(iii) a radioactive material,  (iv) a polychlorinated  biphenyl, (v) asbestos or
asbestos containing material, or (vi) a carcinogen.

9.       Assignment and Subletting.

         9.1 Transfers;  Consent.  Tenant shall not have the right,  without the
prior  written  consent of  Landlord  which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably
denied, to, (a) assign, transfer, mortgage,  hypothecate, or encumber this Lease
or any estate or interest herein,  whether directly,  indirectly or by operation
of law,  (b) permit  any other  entity to become a Tenant  hereunder  by merger,
consolidation,  or other  reorganization,  with the  exception  of  wholly-owned
subsidiaries  and  affiliates  of Tenant as set forth in  Paragraph  9.3, (c) if
Tenant  is  a  corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,  limited
liability partnership, trust, association or other business entity (other than a
corporation whose stock is publicly traded), permit, directly or indirectly, the
transfer of any ownership  interest in Tenant so as to result in (i) a change in
the current control of Tenant,  (ii) a transfer of twenty-five  percent (25%) or
more  in the  aggregate  in any  twelve  (12)  month  period  in the  beneficial
ownership of such entity or (iii) a transfer of all or substantially  all of the
assets of  Tenant,  (d) sublet any  portion  of the  Premises,  or (e) grant any
license,  concession,  or other  right of  occupancy  of or with  respect to any
portion of the  Premises,  or (f) permit  the use of the  Premises  by any party
other than Tenant or a Tenant Party (each of the events listed in this Paragraph
9.1 being referred to herein as a  "Transfer").  If Tenant  requests  Landlord's
consent to any  Transfer,  then at least twenty (20)  business days prior to the
effective date of the proposed  Transfer,  Tenant shall provide  Landlord with a
written description of all terms and conditions of the proposed Transfer and all
consideration   therefor  (including  a  calculation  of  the  Transfer  Profits
described  below),  copies  of the  proposed  documentation,  and the  following
information relating to the proposed transferee:  name and address;  information
reasonably   satisfactory

Page 5 of 22
<PAGE>

to Landlord concerning the proposed  transferee's business and business history;
its  proposed  use  of  the  Premises;  banking,  financial,  and  other  credit
information;  and general references  sufficient to enable Landlord to determine
the proposed  transferee's  creditworthiness  and character.  Landlord shall not
unreasonably  withhold  its  consent  to any  assignment  or  subletting  of the
Premises,  provided  that the  parties  agree  that it shall be  reasonable  for
Landlord  to  withhold  any  such  consent  if,  without  limitation,   Landlord
determines in good faith that (A) the proposed transferee is not of a reasonable
financial  standing or is not  creditworthy,  (B) the proposed  transferee  is a
governmental agency, (C) the proposed  transferee,  or any affiliate thereof, is
then an  occupant in the Project or has  engaged in  discussions  with  Landlord
concerning  a lease of direct space in the  Project,  (D) the proposed  Transfer
would  result in a breach of any  obligation  of  Landlord  or permit  any other
tenant in the  Project to  terminate  or modify its lease,  (E) there is then in
effect  an  uncured  Event of  Default,  (F) the  Transfer  would  increase  the
occupancy density or parking density of the Project or any portion thereof,  (G)
the Transfer  would  result in an  undesirable  tenant mix for the  Project,  as
determined in good faith by Landlord, (H) the proposed transferee does not enjoy
a good  reputation,  as a business or as a tenant.  Any  Transfer  made  without
Landlord's consent shall be void and, at Landlord's  election,  shall constitute
an Event of  Default  by  Tenant.  Tenant  shall  also,  within ten (10) days of
written demand therefor,  pay to Landlord $500 as a review fee for each Transfer
request, and reimburse Landlord for its reasonable attorneys' fees and all other
costs  incurred  in  connection  with  considering  any request for consent to a
proposed  Transfer.  If  Landlord  consents  to a  proposed  Transfer,  then the
proposed  transferee shall deliver to Landlord Landlord's standard form transfer
consent and  agreement  whereby the proposed  transferee  expressly  assumes the
Tenant's  obligations  hereunder.  Landlord's  consent to a  Transfer  shall not
release Tenant from its  obligations  under this Lease (or any guarantor of this
Lease of its  obligations  with  respect  thereto),  but  rather  Tenant and its
transferee shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations  under this
Lease allocable to the space subject to such Transfer. Landlord's consent to any
Transfer shall not waive Landlord's  rights as to any subsequent  Transfers.  In
the event of any claim by Tenant that  Landlord  has  breached  its  obligations
under this Paragraph 13,  Tenant's  remedies shall be limited to recovery of its
out-of-pocket damages and injunctive relief.

         9.2 Cancellation and Recapture. Notwithstanding Paragraph 9.1, Landlord
may (but shall not be obligated to), within sixty (60) days after  submission of
Tenant's written request for Landlord's  consent to an assignment or subletting,
cancel  this Lease as to the  portion of the  Premises  proposed to be sublet or
subject to an  assignment of this Lease  ("Transfer  Space") as of the date such
proposed  Transfer is proposed to be  effective  and,  thereafter,  Landlord may
lease such  portion of the  Premises to the  prospective  transferee  (or to any
other person or entity or not at all) without  liability to Tenant.  If Landlord
shall not cancel this Lease within such sixty-day period and notwithstanding any
Landlord  consent  to the  proposed  Transfer,  Tenant  shall  pay to  Landlord,
immediately upon receipt thereof,  fifty percent (50%) of the excess  ("Transfer
Profits") of all compensation and other consideration paid to or for the benefit
of Tenant (or any affiliate thereof) for the Transfer in excess of Base Rent and
additional rent payable by Tenant hereunder (with respect to the Transfer Space)
during  the  remainder  of the Term  (after  straight-line  amortization  of any
reasonable brokerage  commissions and tenant improvement costs paid by Tenant in
connection with the Transfer over the term of the Transfer).

         9.3  Permitted  Transfers.  An  "Affiliate"  means any entity  that (i)
controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Tenant, (ii) results
from the transfer of all or  substantially  all of Tenant's  assets or stock, or
(iii) results from the merger or  consolidation  of Tenant with another  entity.
"Control"  means the direct or  indirect  ownership  of more than fifty  percent
(50%) of the voting  securities  of an entity or possession of the right to vote
more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting  interest in the ordinary  direction
of the entity's affairs.  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in
this Lease,  Landlord's  consent is not  required for and  Landlord's  recapture
rights shall not apply to any  assignment  of this Lease or sublease of all or a
portion of the Premises to an Affiliate so long as the following  conditions are
met: (a) at least ten (10) business days before any such assignment or sublease,
Landlord  receives written notice of such assignment or sublease (as well as any
documents or information reasonably requested by Landlord regarding the proposed
intended  transfer and the transferee);  (b) Tenant is not then in default under
this Lease;  (c) if the transfer is an  assignment  or any other  transfer to an
Affiliate other than a sublease, the intended assignee assumes in writing all of
Tenant's  obligations  under  this  Lease  relating  to  the  Premises  in  form
satisfactory  to  Landlord  or, if the  transfer  is a  sublease,  the  intended
sublessee  accepts  the  sublease  in form  satisfactory  to  Landlord;  (d) the
intended  transferee  has a  tangible  net  worth,  as  evidenced  by  financial
statements  delivered to Landlord  and  certified  by an  independent  certified
public accountant in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting  principles
that are consistently applied, at least equal to one-half (1/2) the tangible net
worth of Tenant as of the date of this Lease; (e) the Premises shall continue to
be operated solely for the use specified in the Basic Lease Information; and (f)
Tenant shall pay to Landlord Landlord's  standard fee for approving  assignments
and subleases and all costs reasonably  incurred by Landlord or any mortgagee or
ground lessor for such assignment or subletting,  including, without limitation,
reasonable  attorneys' fees. No transfer to an Affiliate in accordance with this
subparagraph  shall  relieve  Tenant named herein of any  obligation  under this
Lease or alter the primary  liability  of Tenant named herein for the payment of
Rent or for the  performance of any other  obligation to be performed by Tenant,
including  the  obligations  contained  in  Paragraph  5  with  respect  to  any
Affiliate.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Lease, the transfer of
outstanding  capital stock or other listed equity interests,  or the purchase of
outstanding  capital stock or other listed equity interests,  or the purchase of
equity  interests  issued in an initial public  offering of stock, by persons or
parties other than "insiders" within the meaning of the Securities  Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended,  through the  "over-the-counter"  market or any  recognized
national  or  international   securities  exchange  shall  not  be  included  in
determining whether control has been transferred.


10.      Insurance, Waivers, Subrogation and Indemnity.

         10.1 Insurance.  Tenant shall maintain  throughout the Term each of the
insurance  policies described on Exhibit "D" attached hereto and shall otherwise
comply with each and all of the obligations and requirements provided on Exhibit
"D."

         10.2 Waiver of Subrogation.  Landlord and Tenant each waives any claim,
loss or cost it might have  against  the other for any injury to or death of any
person or persons, or damage to or theft,  destruction,  loss, or loss of use of
any  property  (a  "Loss"),  to the  extent  the same is  insured  against or is
required  to be  insured  against  under the terms  hereof  under any "all risk"
property  damage  insurance  policy  that  covers the  Building,  the  Premises,
Landlord's or Tenant's fixtures, personal property,  leasehold improvements,  or
business,  regardless  of whether the  negligence of the other party caused such
Loss.

         10.3  Indemnity  by Tenant.  Subject to  Paragraph  10.2,  Tenant shall
indemnify, defend and hold Landlord, Spieker Properties, Inc., and each of their
respective  directors,  shareholders,   partners,  lenders,  members,  managers,
contractors,  affiliates and employees  (collectively,  "Landlord  Indemnitees")
from  and  against  all  claims,  demands,  proceedings,   losses,  obligations,
liabilities,  causes of action, suits, judgments,  damages, penalties, costs and
expenses (including,  without limitation,  reasonable  attorneys' fees and court
costs)  arising from or asserted in connection  with the use or occupancy of the
Premises by Tenant or any Tenant Party, including, without limitation, by reason
of any  release of any  Hazardous  Materials  by Tenant or any Tenant  Party in,
under, on, or about the Project, or any negligence or misconduct of Tenant or of
any  Tenant  Party in or  about  the  Premises,  including  without  limitation,
Tenant's breach of any of its covenants under this Lease, except in each case to
the extent  arising  primarily  from the  negligence  or willful  misconduct  of
Landlord or any Landlord Indemnitee.  Except to the extent expressly provided in
this Lease,  Tenant hereby waives all claims  against and releases  Landlord and
each Landlord Indemnitee for any injury to or death of persons, damage

Page     6 of 22
<PAGE>

to property  or  business  loss in any manner  related to (i)  Tenant's  use and
occupancy of the Premises,  (ii) acts of God,  (iii) acts of third  parties,  or
(iv) any matter  outside of the reasonable  control of Landlord,  except in each
case to the extent arising from the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord
or any Landlord  Indemnitee.  This Paragraph  10.3 shall survive  termination or
expiration of this Lease.

         10.4 Indemnity by Landlord. Landlord shall indemnify, defend by counsel
reasonably  acceptable  to Tenant,  protect  and hold Tenant  harmless  from and
against any and all claims,  liabilities,  losses, costs,  damages,  injuries or
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and court costs,
demands,  causes of action,  or  judgments  arising  out of or  relating  to the
negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or Landlord's agents,  employees or
invitees. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this  Lease,  Landlord  shall in no event be liable to Tenant and Tenant  hereby
waives all  claims  against  Landlord  for any injury or damage to any person or
property  in or about the  Premises,  Building  or  Project,  including  without
limitation  the  common  areas,  whether  caused by theft,  fire,  rain or water
leakage of any character  from the roof,  walls,  plumbing,  sprinklers,  pipes,
basement or any other portion of the Premises, Building or Project, or caused by
gas, fire, oil or electricity in, on or about the Premises, Building or Project,
or from any  other  systems  except  in each  case to the  extent  caused by the
negligence  or willful  misconduct  of  Landlord,  or by acts of God  (including
without  limitation flood or earthquake),  acts of a public enemy, riot, strike,
insurrection,  war, court order,  requisition or order of  governmental  body or
authority or from any other cause whatsoever, or for any damage or inconvenience
which may arise  through  repair,  subject to and except as expressly  otherwise
provided  in  Paragraph  7.2 or 10.2 of this Lease  except to the extent  caused
directly by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord. In addition,
Landlord shall in no event be liable for (i) injury to Tenant's  business or any
loss of income or profit therefrom or from consequential  damages,  or (ii) sums
up to the  amount of  insurance  proceeds  received  by  Tenant.  The  foregoing
indemnity by Landlord shall not be applicable to include  Tenant's breach of any
of its covenants  under this Lease claims to the extent  primarily  arising from
the  negligence  or  willful  misconduct  of Tenant  or  Tenant's  Parties.  The
foregoing  indemnity  by  Landlord  shall  survive  the  expiration  or  earlier
termination of this Lease.

11.      Subordination; Attornment.

         11.1  Subordination.  This  Lease is  subject  and  subordinate  to all
present and future ground or master leases of the Project and to the lien of all
mortgages  or deeds  of  trust  (collectively,  "Security  Instruments")  now or
hereafter  encumbering  the Project,  if any, and to all  renewals,  extensions,
modifications, consolidations and replacements thereof, and to all advances made
or  hereafter  to be made upon the  security of any such  Security  Instruments,
unless the holders of any such mortgages or deeds of trust, or the lessors under
such  ground  or  master   leases  (such   holders  and  lessors  are  sometimes
collectively referred to herein as "Holders") require in writing that this Lease
be superior thereto.  Notwithstanding  any provision of this Paragraph 11 to the
contrary,  any Holder of any Security Instrument may at any time subordinate the
lien of its Security Instrument to this Lease without obtaining Tenant's consent
by giving Tenant written notice of such subordination, in which event this Lease
shall be deemed to be senior to the  Security  Instrument  in  question.  Tenant
shall,  within  twenty  (20)  days of  request  to do so by  Landlord,  execute,
acknowledge  and deliver to Landlord such further  instruments  or assurances as
Landlord  may  deem   necessary  or  appropriate  to  evidence  or  confirm  the
subordination  or  superiority  of this Lease to any such  Security  Instrument;
provided,  however,  that at the  request of Tenant made within ten (10) days of
any such Landlord  request,  such Holder shall execute and deliver to Tenant its
standard nondisturbance agreement. Tenant hereby irrevocably authorizes Landlord
to execute and deliver in the name of Tenant any such  instrument or instruments
if Tenant fails to do so within said a twenty (20) day period.

         11.2 Attornment. Tenant covenants and agrees that in the event that any
proceedings are brought for the foreclosure of any mortgage or deed of trust, or
if any  ground or master  lease is  terminated,  it shall  attorn,  without  any
deductions or set-offs  whatsoever,  to the purchaser upon any such  foreclosure
sale, or to the lessor of such ground or master lease, as the case may be, if so
requested to do so by such purchaser or lessor,  and to recognize such purchaser
or lessor as  "Landlord"  under this Lease;  provided,  however,  that  Tenant's
obligation  as set forth in this  Paragraph  11.2  shall be  condition  upon the
execution  and  delivery  to  Tenant  by  any  such  purchaser  or  lessor  of a
nondisturbance  agreement  commercially  reasonable and acceptable to Tenant. If
requested,  Tenant shall enter into a new lease with that  successor on the same
terms and  conditions as are contained in this Lease (for the unexpired  portion
of the Term then remaining).

12.  Rules and  Regulations.  Tenant shall  comply,  and shall cause each Tenant
Party to  comply,  with the  Rules and  Regulations  of the  Building  which are
attached  hereto as Exhibit "A," and all such  nondiscriminatory  modifications,
additions,  deletions  and  amendments  thereto as Landlord  shall adopt in good
faith from time to time.

13.  Condemnation.  If the  entire  Project  or  Premises  are taken by right of
eminent domain or conveyed by Landlord in lieu thereof (a "Taking"),  this Lease
shall terminate as of the date of the Taking. If any part of the Project becomes
subject to a Taking and such Taking will  prevent  Tenant  from  conducting  its
business in the Premises in a manner  reasonably  comparable  to that  conducted
immediately  before such Taking for a period of more than ninety (90) days, then
Tenant may terminate  this Lease as of the date of such Taking by giving written
notice to Landlord  within thirty (30) days after the Taking,  and all Rent paid
or payable hereunder shall be apportioned  between Landlord and Tenant as of the
date of such Taking. If any material portion, but less than all, of the Project,
Building or the Premises becomes subject to a Taking, or if Landlord is required
to pay any of the  proceeds  received for a Taking to any Holder of any Security
Instrument,  then Landlord may terminate this Lease by delivering written notice
thereof to Tenant within  thirty (30) days after such Taking,  and all Rent paid
or payable hereunder shall be apportioned  between Landlord and Tenant as of the
date of such Taking.  If Tenant does not so terminate this Lease, then Base Rent
thereafter  payable  hereunder shall be abated for the duration of the Taking in
proportion to that portion of the Premises rendered untenantable by such Taking.
If any Taking  occurs,  then  Landlord  shall  receive the entire award or other
compensation  for the land on which the Project is situated,  the  Project,  and
other  improvements  taken,  and  Tenant may  separately  pursue a claim (to the
extent it will not reduce  Landlord's award) against the condemnor for the value
of Tenant's  personal  property  which  Tenant is entitled to remove  under this
Lease and moving  and  relocation  costs.  Landlord  and  Tenant  agree that the
provisions of this Paragraph 13 and the remaining provisions of this Lease shall
exclusively govern the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to any
Taking of any portion of the Premises,  the Building, the Project or the land on
which the Building is located,  and Landlord and Tenant hereby waive and release
each and all of their respective  common law and statutory  rights  inconsistent
herewith,  whether now or hereinafter in effect (including,  without limitation,
Section 1265.130 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, as amended from time
to time).

14.      Fire or Other Casualty.

         14.1 Repair Estimate;  Right to Terminate. If all or any portion of the
Premises,  the  Building or the Project is damaged by fire or other  casualty (a
"Casualty"),  Landlord shall, within ninety (90) days after Landlord's discovery
of such damage,  deliver to Tenant its good faith estimate (the "Damage Notice")
of the time period  following  such notice needed to repair the damage caused by
such Casualty.  Landlord or Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease in any case
where (a) any material  portion of the  Premises or any material  portion of the
Project are damaged and (b) either (i) Landlord estimates in good faith that the
repair and  restoration  of such damage  under  Paragraph  14.2  ("Restoration")
cannot  reasonably  be completed  (without  the payment of overtime)  within two
hundred  (200) days of  Landlord's  actual  discovery of such  damage,  (ii) the
Holder of any Security  Instrument  requires the  application  of any  insurance
proceeds with respect to such Casualty to be applied to the outstanding  balance

Page     7 of 22
<PAGE>

of the obligation  secured by such Security  Instrument,  (iii) the cost of such
Restoration  is not fully  covered by insurance  proceeds  available to Landlord
and/or  payments  received by Landlord  from  tenants,  or (iv) Tenant  shall be
entitled to an abatement of rent under this  Paragraph 14 for any period of time
in excess of thirty-three percent (33%) of the remainder of the Term. Such right
of termination shall be exercisable by Landlord or Tenant by delivery of written
notice to  Tenant or  Landlord,  as the case may be, at any time  following  the
Casualty until  forty-five  (45) days following the later of (A) delivery of the
Damage Notice or (B) Landlord's  discovery or determination of any of the events
described in clauses (i) through (iv) of the  preceding  sentence,  and shall be
effective  upon  delivery  of such notice of  termination  (or if Tenant has not
vacated the Premises, upon the expiration of thirty (30) days thereafter).

         14.2 Repair Obligation; Abatement of Rent. Subject to the provisions of
Paragraph 14.1,  Landlord shall,  within thirty (30) days after the discovery by
Landlord of any damage resulting from a Casualty,  begin to repair the damage to
the Building and the Premises  resulting  from such  Casualty and shall  proceed
with reasonable  diligence to restore the Building and Premises to substantially
the same  condition  as existed  immediately  before such  Casualty,  except for
modifications required by Regulations,  and modifications to the Building or the
Project  reasonably  deemed  desirable  by  Landlord;  provided,  however,  that
Landlord  shall not be  required  to repair or replace  any of the  Alterations,
furniture,  equipment,  fixtures,  and  other  improvements  which may have been
placed by, or at the request of,  Tenant or other  occupants  in the Building or
the  Premises.  Landlord  shall  have  no  liability  for any  inconvenience  or
annoyance to Tenant or injury to Tenant's  business as a result of any Casualty,
regardless of the cause  therefor;  provided,  however,  that Landlord shall not
unreasonably  interfere with Tenant's occupancy of the Premises.  Base Rent, and
additional  rent payable under Paragraph 3.2, shall abate if and to the extent a
Casualty  damages  the  Premises  or common  areas in the Project or renders any
material portion of the Premises unfit for Tenant's occupancy, and such portions
are not occupied by Tenant, for the period of time commencing on the date Tenant
vacates the portion of the Premises  affected on account  thereof and continuing
until the date the  Restoration  with respect to the Premises  (and/or  required
common areas) is substantially  complete, as determined by Landlord's architect.
Landlord  and Tenant  agree that the  provisions  of this  Paragraph  14 and the
remaining  provisions  of this  Lease  shall  exclusively  govern the rights and
obligations of the parties with respect to any and all damage to, or destruction
of, all or any portion of the Premises or the Project by Casualty,  and Landlord
and Tenant hereby waive and release each and all of their respective  common law
and statutory rights inconsistent herewith, whether now or hereinafter in effect
(including,  without limitation,  Sections 1932(2) and 1933(4) of the California
Civil Code, as amended from time to time).

15. Parking. Tenant shall have the right to the nonexclusive use of such portion
of the parking facilities of the Project as are designated by Landlord from time
to time for such purpose for the parking of  passenger-size  motor vehicles used
by Tenant and Tenant Parties only and are not  transferable  without  Landlord's
approval.  The use of such parking facilities shall be subject to such rules and
regulations  as are  adopted by  Landlord  from time to time for the use of such
facilities.

16. Events of Default.  Each of the following  occurrences shall be an "Event of
Default"  and shall  constitute  a material  default and breach of this Lease by
Tenant:  (a) any  failure  by  Tenant  to pay  any  installment  of  Base  Rent,
additional  rent or to make any  other  payment  required  to be made by  Tenant
hereunder  within ten (10) days of when due; (b) the  abandonment or vacation of
the  Premises by Tenant,  provided,  however,  that  unless  Tenant is using the
Premises for a retail use,  abandonment or vacation of the Premises shall not be
an Event of Default so long as no other Event of Default has occurred  hereunder
and provided  Tenant has given  Landlord five (5) days' prior written  notice of
its  intent to vacate the  Premises;  (c) any  failure by Tenant to execute  and
deliver any estoppel  certificate or other  document or instrument  described in
Paragraphs 10 (insurance),  11 (subordination)  or 21.2 (estoppel  certificates)
requested by  Landlord,  where such  failure  continues  for ten (10) days after
delivery  of written  notice of such  failure  by  Landlord  to Tenant;  (d) any
failure by Tenant to fully perform any other material obligation of Tenant under
this Lease,  where such failure  continues  for thirty (30) days (except where a
shorter  period of time is specified  in this Lease,  in which case such shorter
time period  shall apply)  after  delivery of written  notice of such failure by
Landlord to Tenant;  (e) the voluntary or involuntary filing of a petition by or
against  Tenant or any general  partner of Tenant (i) in any bankruptcy or other
insolvency proceeding, (ii) seeking any relief under any state or federal debtor
relief law,  (iii) for the  appointment  of a liquidator  or receiver for all or
substantially  all of Tenant's  property or for Tenant's interest in this Lease,
or (iv) for the  reorganization  or modification of Tenant's  capital  structure
(provided,  however,  that if such a petition is filed against Tenant, then such
filing  shall  not be an  Event  of  Default  unless  Tenant  fails  to have the
proceedings  initiated by such petition  dismissed  within sixty (60) days after
the filing  thereof);  (f) the default of any guarantor of Tenant's  obligations
hereunder  under any  guaranty  of this  Lease,  the  attempted  repudiation  or
revocation of any such guaranty,  or the  participation by any such guarantor in
any other event described in this Paragraph 16 (as if this Paragraph 16 referred
to such guarantor in place of Tenant);  or (g) any other event,  act or omission
which any other provision of this Lease  identifies as an Event of Default.  Any
notice of any failure of Tenant  required  under this  Paragraph  16 shall be in
lieu of, and not in addition to, any notice  required under Section 1161 et seq.
of the California Code of Civil Procedure.

17.  Remedies.  Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default by Tenant,  Landlord
shall have, in addition to any other remedies available to Landlord at law or in
equity (all of which remedies shall be distinct,  separate, and cumulative), the
option to pursue any one (1) or more of the following remedies,  each and all of
which  shall be  cumulative  and  nonexclusive,  without  any  notice  or demand
whatsoever:

         (a)  Terminate  this Lease,  and  Landlord  may recover from Tenant the
following: (i) the worth at the time of any unpaid rent which has been earned at
the time of such  termination;  plus  (ii) the worth at the time of award of the
amount by which the unpaid rent which would have been earned  after  termination
until the time of award  exceeds  the  amount of such  rental  loss that  Tenant
proves could have been reasonably  avoided;  plus (iii) the worth at the time of
award of the amount by which the unpaid  rent for the  balance of the term after
the time of award  exceeds the amount of such  rental  loss that  Tenant  proves
could have been  reasonably  avoided;  plus (iv) any other  amount  necessary to
compensate Landlord for all the detriment proximately caused by Tenant's failure
to perform its  obligations  under this Lease or which in the ordinary course of
things  would be likely to result  therefrom  (specifically  including,  without
limitation, brokerage commissions and advertising expenses incurred, expenses of
remodeling the Premises or any portion thereof for a new tenant, whether for the
same or a  different  use,  and any  special  concessions  made to  obtain a new
tenant); and (v) at Landlord's election, such other amounts in addition to or in
lieu of the foregoing as may be permitted  from time to time by applicable  law.
The term  "rent" as used in this  Paragraph  17(a)  shall be deemed to be and to
mean all sums of every  nature  required  to be paid by Tenant  pursuant  to the
terms of this Lease,  whether to Landlord  or to others.  As used in  Paragraphs
17(a)(i) and (ii),  above, the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by
allowing  interest at the Default Rate,  but in no case greater than the maximum
amount of such interest permitted by law. As used in Paragraph 17(a)(iii) above,
the "worth at the time of award" shall be computed by discounting such amount at
the discount  rate of the Federal  Reserve Bank of San  Francisco at the time of
award plus one percent (1%).

         (b) Landlord shall have the remedy  described in California  Civil Code
Section 1951.4  (lessor may continue  lease in effect after lessee's  breach and
abandonment  and  recover  rent as it  becomes  due,  if lessee has the right to
sublet or assign,  subject  only to  reasonable  limitations).  Accordingly,  if
Landlord  does not elect to  terminate  this  Lease on  account  of any Event of
Default by Tenant,  Landlord may, from time to time,  without  terminating  this
Lease,  enforce all of its rights and remedies  under this Lease,  including the
right to recover all Rent as it becomes due.

Page 8 of 22
<PAGE>

         (c)  Landlord  shall at all times have the rights and  remedies  (which
shall be  cumulative  with each other and  cumulative  and in  addition to those
rights and remedies available under Paragraphs 17(a) and 17(b) above, or any law
or other  provision of this  Lease),  without  prior demand or notice  except as
required  by  applicable  law or as  otherwise  required  herein,  to  seek  any
declaratory,  injunctive,  or other equitable relief,  and specifically  enforce
this Lease, or restrain or enjoin a violation or breach of any provision hereof.

         (d) Following the occurrence of three instances of payment of Rent more
than ten (10) days late in any twelve  (12) month  period,  the late  charge set
forth in Paragraph 4 shall apply from the date payment was due and Landlord may,
without prejudice to any other rights or remedies  available to it, upon written
notice to  Tenant,  require  that all  remaining  monthly  installments  of Rent
payable under this Lease shall be payable by cashier's check or electronic funds
transfer three (3) months in advance,  and may require that Tenant  increase the
Security  Deposit to an amount equal to three times the current  month's Rent at
the time of the most recent default. In addition,  (i) upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default by Tenant,  if the Premises or any portion  thereof are sublet,
Landlord  may, at its option and in addition and without  prejudice to any other
remedies  herein  provided  or  provided  by  law,  collect  directly  from  the
sublessee(s)  all  rentals  becoming  due to the Tenant  and apply such  rentals
against other sums due hereunder to Landlord;  and (ii) without prejudice to any
other  right or remedy of  Landlord,  if Tenant  shall be in default  under this
Lease,  Landlord may cure the same at the expense of Tenant (A)  immediately and
without notice in the case (1) of emergency, (2) where such default unreasonably
interferes with any other tenant in the Building, or (3) where such default will
result in the violation of any Regulation or the  cancellation  of any insurance
policy  maintained  by  Landlord,  and (B) in any  other  case  if such  default
continues  for ten (10) days  following  the receipt by Tenant of notice of such
default  from  Landlord  and all costs  incurred  by  Landlord  in  curing  such
default(s),   including,   without   limitation,   attorneys'   fees,  shall  be
reimbursable  by Tenant as Rent  hereunder  upon demand,  together with interest
thereon,  from the date such costs were  incurred  by  Landlord,  at the Default
Rate.

18. Surrender of Premises. No act by Landlord shall be deemed an acceptance of a
surrender  of the  Premises,  and no  agreement  to  accept a  surrender  of the
Premises  shall be valid unless it is in writing and signed by Landlord.  At the
expiration  or  earlier  termination  of this  Lease,  Tenant  shall  deliver to
Landlord all keys (including any electronic  access devices and the like) to the
Premises,  and  Tenant  shall  deliver  to  Landlord  the  Premises  in the same
condition,  in all material  respects,  as existed on the date Tenant originally
took possession thereof, ordinary wear and tear excepted, provided that ordinary
wear and tear shall not  include  repair and clean up items.  By way of example,
but without limitation,  repair and clean up items shall include cleaning of all
interior walls, carpets and floors, replacement of damaged or missing ceiling or
floor tiles, window coverings or cover plates,  removal of any Tenant-introduced
markings,  and repair of all holes and gaps, as well as the removal requirements
below.  In  addition,  prior  to the  expiration  of  the  Term  or  any  sooner
termination  thereof, (a) Tenant shall remove such Alterations as Landlord shall
request  and  shall  restore  the  portion  of the  Premises  affected  by  such
Alterations and such removal to its condition existing  immediately prior to the
making of such  Alterations,  (b) Tenant  shall  remove  from the  Premises  all
unattached trade fixtures, furniture, equipment and personal property located in
the Premises,  including,  without limitation,  phone equipment, wiring, cabling
and all garbage, waste and debris, and (c) Tenant shall repair all damage to the
Premises  or  the  Project  caused  by  any  such  removal  including,   without
limitation,  full  restoration  of all  holes and gaps  resulting  from any such
removal.  All personal  property and fixtures of Tenant not so removed shall, to
the  extent  permitted  under  applicable  Regulations,  be  deemed to have been
abandoned  by  Tenant  and may be  appropriated,  sold,  stored,  destroyed,  or
otherwise  disposed  of by  Landlord  without  notice to Tenant and  without any
obligation to account for such items.

19.  Holding  Over.  If Tenant  holds  over  after  the  expiration  or  earlier
termination of the Term hereof,  with or without the express or implied  consent
of Landlord,  Tenant shall become and be only a tenant at  sufferance at a daily
rent equal to  one-thirtieth  of the greater of (a) the then prevailing  monthly
fair market  rental  rate as  determined  by  Landlord in its sole and  absolute
discretion,  or (b) one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the monthly  installment
of Base Rent (and estimated additional rent payable under Paragraph 3.2) payable
by Tenant  immediately  prior to such expiration or  termination,  and otherwise
upon the terms, covenants and conditions herein specified, so far as applicable,
as  reasonably  determined  by Landlord.  Neither any  provision  hereof nor any
acceptance  by  Landlord  of any Rent  after  any  such  expiration  or  earlier
termination  (including,  without  limitation,  through any "lockbox")  shall be
deemed a consent to any holdover  hereunder or result in a renewal of this Lease
or an  extension  of the  Term,  or any  waiver of any of  Landlord's  rights or
remedies  with respect to such  holdover.  Notwithstanding  any provision to the
contrary  contained herein, (i) Landlord expressly reserves the right to require
Tenant to surrender  possession of the Premises upon the  expiration of the Term
or upon the earlier  termination hereof or at any time during any holdover,  and
the right to assert any remedy at law or in equity to evict  Tenant and  collect
damages in connection with any such holdover,  and (ii) Tenant shall  indemnify,
defend and hold Landlord harmless from and against any and all claims,  demands,
actions,  proceedings,  losses, damages,  liabilities,  obligations,  penalties,
costs and expenses,  including,  without limitation,  all lost profits and other
consequential  damages,  attorneys'  fees,  consultants'  fees and  court  costs
incurred  or  suffered  by or  asserted  against  Landlord by reason of Tenant's
failure to surrender the Premises on the  expiration or earlier  termination  of
this Lease in accordance with the provisions of this Lease.

20.  Substitution  Space.

21.      Miscellaneous.

         21.1  Landlord   Transfers  and   Liability.   Landlord  may,   without
restriction,  sell,  assign or  transfer in any manner all or any portion of the
Project,  any interest therein or any of Landlord's  rights under this Lease. If
Landlord assigns its rights under this Lease, then Landlord shall  automatically
be released from any further obligations  hereunder,  provided that the assignee
thereof  assumes in writing all of  Landlord's  obligations  hereunder  accruing
after such  assignment.  The  liability of Landlord to Tenant for any default by
Landlord  under the terms of this  Lease or with  respect to any  obligation  or
liability  related to the Premises or the Project shall be recoverable only from
the interest of Landlord in the Project,  and neither Landlord nor any affiliate
thereof shall have any personal  liability  with respect  thereto and in no case
shall Landlord be liable to Tenant for

any lost  profits,  damage to  business,  or any form of  special,  indirect  or
consequential  damage on  account of any  breach of this  Lease,  subject to the
rights and provisions of Paragraph 2(C).

         21.2 Estoppel Certificates;  Financial Statements. At any time and from
time to time during the Term, Tenant shall, without charge, execute, acknowledge
and deliver to Landlord within twenty (20) days or as soon as readily  available
after Landlord's  request therefor,  an estoppel  certificate in recordable form
containing such factual  certifications and other provisions as are found in the
estoppel  certificate  forms requested by institutional  lenders and purchasers.
Tenant agrees in any case that (a) the foregoing certificate may be relied on by
anyone  holding or  proposing  to acquire any  interest  in the Project  from or
through  Landlord or by any  mortgagee  or lessor or  prospective  mortgagee  or
lessor of the  Project or of any  interest  therein and (b) the form of estoppel
certificate shall be in the form of, at Landlord's  election,  the standard form
of such  present  or  prospective  lender,  lessor  or  purchaser  (or any  form
substantially similar thereto), or any other form that Landlord shall reasonably
select.  At the request of Landlord  from time to time,  Tenant shall provide to
Landlord within ten (10) days of Landlord's  request  therefor  Tenant's and any
guarantor's current financial statements.

         21.3  Notices.  Notices,  requests,  consents  or other  communications
desired or required to be given by or on behalf of Landlord or Tenant under this
Lease shall be effective  only if given in writing and sent by (a) registered or
certified United States mail, postage prepaid, (b) nationally recognized express
mail courier that provides  written evidence of delivery,  fees prepaid,  or (c)
facsimile and United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed as set forth in
the Basic Lease Information, or at such other address in the State of California
as may be  specified  from time to time,  in writing,  or, if to Tenant,  at the
Premises. Any such notice,  request,  consent, or other communication shall only
be deemed given (i) if sent by  registered  or certified  United States mail, on
the day it is officially delivered to or refused by the intended recipient, (ii)
if sent  by  nationally  recognized  express  mail  courier,  on the  date it is
officially  recorded by such courier,  (iii) if delivered by  facsimile,  on the
date the sender  obtains  written  telephonic  confirmation  that the electronic
transmission was received, or (iv) if delivered personally, upon delivery or, if
refused by the intended recipient, upon attempted delivery.

         21.4  Payment  by Tenant;  Non-Waiver.  Landlord's  acceptance  of Rent
(including,  without  limitation,  through any "lockbox")  following an Event of
Default shall not waive Landlord's  rights  regarding such Event of Default.  No
waiver by  Landlord  of any  violation  or breach of any of the terms  contained
herein shall waive  Landlord's  rights  regarding  any future  violation of such
terms.  Landlord's  acceptance  of any  partial  payment of Rent shall not waive
Landlord's  rights with regard to the remaining portion of the Rent that is due,
regardless of any endorsement or other statement on any instrument  delivered in
payment of Rent or any writing delivered in connection  therewith;  accordingly,
Landlord's  acceptance  of a partial  payment  of Rent shall not  constitute  an
accord  and  satisfaction  of the full  amount of the Rent  that is due,  unless
states to be so in writing by Landlord.

         21.5 Certain Rights Reserved by Landlord.  Landlord hereby reserves and
shall have the following rights,  upon no less than forty-eight (48) hours prior
written notice (except in the case of emergencies)  with respect to the Premises
and the Project: (a) to decorate and to make inspections,  repairs, alterations,
additions,  changes,  or improvements,  whether structural or otherwise,  in and
about the Project, the Building, the Premises or any part thereof; to enter upon
the Premises and, during the continuance of any such work, to temporarily  close
doors, entryways, public space, and corridors in the Project or the Building; to
interrupt or suspend temporarily Building services and facilities; to change the
name of the Building or the Project;  and to change the arrangement and location
of entrances or passageways,  doors, and doorways, corridors, elevators, stairs,
restrooms,  common areas,  or other public parts of the Building or the Project;
(b) to take such  measures as  Landlord  deems  advisable  in good faith for the
security of the Building and its occupants;  to  temporarily  deny access to the
Building to any person;  and to close the Building after ordinary business hours
and on Sundays and Holidays,  subject,  however, to Tenant's right to enter when
the  Building  is closed  after  ordinary  business  hours  under such rules and
regulations  as Landlord may  reasonably  prescribe from time to time during the
Term;  and (c) to enter the Premises at  reasonable  hours (or at any time in an
emergency) to perform repairs,  to take any action authorized  hereunder,  or to
show the Premises to prospective  purchasers or lenders, or, during the last six
(6) months of the Term, prospective tenants.

         21.6  Miscellaneous.  If any  clause  or  provision  of this  Lease  is
illegal,  invalid,  or  unenforceable  under  present or future  laws,  then the
remainder  of this Lease  shall not be affected  thereby.  This Lease may not be
amended  except by  instrument  in writing  signed by Landlord  and  Tenant.  No
provision  of this  Lease  shall be deemed to have been  waived by  Landlord  or
Tenant, as the case may be, unless such waiver is in writing signed by Landlord.
The terms and  conditions  contained in this Lease shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the parties hereto, and upon their respective  successors in
interest  and  legal  representatives,  except  as  otherwise  herein  expressly
provided.  This Lease  constitutes  the entire  agreement  between  Landlord and
Tenant  regarding the subject matter hereof and  supersedes all oral  statements
and prior writings relating thereto. Tenant and the person or persons signing on
behalf of Tenant  represent and warrant that Tenant has full right and authority
to enter into this Lease,  and that all persons signing this Lease on its behalf
are  authorized  to do so. If Tenant is comprised  of more than one party,  each
such party shall be jointly and severally liable for Tenant's  obligations under
this Lease. All exhibits and attachments attached hereto are incorporated herein
by this  reference.  This Lease shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of California. In any action which Landlord or Tenant
brings to enforce its respective rights hereunder,  the unsuccessful party shall
pay all costs incurred by the prevailing party,  including  without  limitation,
reasonable  attorneys'  fees and court costs.  Time is of the essence  regarding
this Lease and all of its provisions.  Tenant shall not record this Lease or any
memorandum  hereof.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LANDLORD AND TENANT
EACH  WAIVE  RIGHT  TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY  LITIGATION  ARISING  OUT OF OR WITH
RESPECT TO THIS LEASE. Submission of this Lease to Tenant does not constitute an
option  or offer  to lease  and this  Lease  is not  effective  otherwise  until
execution and delivery by both  Landlord and Tenant.  This Lease may be executed
in any number of  counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original.  The
covenants   between   Landlord  and  Tenant  hereunder  shall  be  construed  as
independent  and not dependent.  Time is of the essence as to the performance of
each covenant hereunder in which time of performance is a factor.

22.      Addenda/Additional Provisions.

         22.1  Option to Renew.  Tenant  shall,  provided  this Lease is in full
force  and  effect  and  Tenant  is not in  default  under  any of the terms and
conditions of this Lease, have two (2) successive  option(s) to renew this Lease
for a term of two (2) years,  for the Premises in "as is"  condition  and on the
same terms and  conditions  set forth in this  Lease,  except as modified by the
terms, covenants and conditions set forth below:

         (a) If Tenant elects to exercise such option, then Tenant shall provide
Landlord  with  written  notice no earlier  than the date which is fifteen  (15)
months prior to the  expiration  of the then current term of this Lease,  but no
later than 5:00 p.m.  (Pacific  Standard  Time) on the date which is twelve (12)
months prior to the expiration of the then current term of this Lease. If Tenant
fails to provide such notice,  Tenant shall have no further or additional  right
to extend or renew the Term of this Lease.

         (b) The Base Rent for each  option  to renew  this  Lease  shall be the
Monthly Base Rent in effect at the  expiration  of the previous  term  increased
annually by four percent (4%).

         (c) Landlord  shall have no obligation to provide or pay for any tenant
improvements or brokerage commissions during any renewal term.

         (d)  Tenant's  right to  exercise  any  option(s)  to renew  under this
Paragraph shall be conditioned upon Tenant occupying the entire Premises and the
same not being occupied by any assignee, subtenant or licensee other than Tenant
or its affiliate at the time of exercise of any option and  commencement  of the
renewal  term.  Tenant's  exercise  of any option to renew  shall  constitute  a
representation  by Tenant to  Landlord  that as of the date of  exercise  of the
option and the  commencement  of the  applicable  renewal term,  Tenant does not
intend to seek to assign  this  Lease in whole or in part,  or sublet all or any
portion of the Premises.

         (e) Any exercise by Tenant of any option to renew under this  Paragraph
shall be irrevocable. If requested by Landlord, Tenant agrees to execute a lease
amendment or, at Landlord's  option,  a new lease  agreement on Landlord's  then
standard  lease  form for the  Building,  reflecting  the  foregoing  terms  and
conditions,  prior to the  commencement  of the renewal  term.  The option(s) to
renew granted under this Paragraph is/are not  transferable;  the parties hereto
acknowledge  and agree  that they  intend  that each  option to renew this Lease
under this  Paragraph  shall be "personal" to the specific  Tenant named in this
Lease and that in no event will any assignee or  sublessee,  except  Affiliates,
have any rights to exercise such option(s) to renew.

         22.2  Option  to  Terminate.  Tenant  shall  have a one  time  right to
terminate  this Lease on the first day of the 37th  month of the Term,  provided
all of the  following  conditions  are met  (which  are for the sole  benefit of
Landlord):

         (a)  Tenant is not in default of this Lease and shall be current in all
obligations of this Lease as of the effective date of the termination.

         (b) Tenant  gives  Landlord no less than one hundred  eighty (180) days
prior written notice.

         (c) Tenant  delivers to Landlord  Two Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  Dollars
($250,000.00) with its written notice to terminate.

         (d) All financial obligations of Tenant under this Lease, including but
not limited to Base Rent, Operating Expenses, Additional Rent, alteration costs,
fees,  late charges and other charges  payable under this Lease are paid through
the effective  date of  termination  or the date Tenant  vacates the Premises as
required hereunder, whichever is later.

         (e) The  Premises  shall be  vacated  by Tenant  in clean and  sanitary
condition  and as  otherwise  required  under  Paragraph  18 of this Lease on or
before the effective date of termination.

         (f) Tenant shall still be  obligated  for  reconciliation  of Operating
Expenses  through  the  effective  date of the  termination  or the date  Tenant
vacates the Premises as required hereunder, whichever is later.

         (g) Landlord shall return to Tenant the sums currently held by Landlord
as a Security  Deposit or prepaid rent under this Lease upon payment to Landlord
of all  amounts  owing to  Landlord  and  satisfaction  of other  conditions  to
termination under this Paragraph 22.2.

         From and after receipt by Landlord of Tenant's termination notice under
clause b above,  Landlord shall have full access to the Premises at all times to
show the Premises to prospective  tenants,  provided  Landlord gives  reasonable
notice.

         22.3 Representation of the Parties. It is hereby acknowledged that both
Landlord and Tenant are acting as principals and  representing  themselves  with
respect to this Lease. As such, no leasing  commission will be due or payable by
either party unless a party elects to have third party representation on its own
accord, and therefore,  would assume full responsibility for any resulting lease
commissions.

         22.4  Measurement  of the  Premises.  Within thirty (30) days after the
date on which Landlord's Base Building Work is substantially complete for Tenant
Improvements  construction,  but in no event  later  than the Term  Commencement
Date,  Landlord shall, at its sole cost,  cause the Premises to be measured by a
mutually   acceptable  and  professionally   qualified   architect  (other  than
Landlord's  or  Tenant's  architect)  licensed in the state of  California.  The
rentable  square feet of the Premises shall be based on a measurement  according
to the Building Owners and Managers Association.  If the rentable square footage
of the  Premises is other than the stated  rentable  feet of the Premises in the
Basic Lease Information,  the Base Rent and Tenant's  Proportionate  Share shall
correspondingly  be  adjusted,  at the same rate per square foot as set forth in
the  Basic  Lease  Information.  Similarly,  the  Tenant  Improvement  Allowance
pursuant to Paragraph 4.2 of Exhibit C shall  correspondingly be adjusted at the
rate per square  foot that is the Tenant  Improvement  Allowance  divided by the
useable square feet of the entire  Premises.  Any  modification or adjustment to
the  rentable  square feet of the Premises and any other terms of the Lease must
be made and agreed to in writing by the  parties  within  thirty (30) days after
Landlord's  receipt  of  architect's  measurement.  Failure  on the  part of the
parties to agree  within  thirty (30) days or any dispute  between  Landlord and
Tenant pertaining this Paragraph 22.4 shall be resolved by submitting to binding
arbitration,  conducted  and  determined  in San Diego  County  according to the
prevailing  rules of the American  Arbitration  Association  for  arbitration of
commercial disputes.

                                   EXHIBIT "A"

                              RULES AND REGULATIONS

1.   Driveways,   sidewalks,  halls,  passages,  exits,  entrances,   elevators,
     escalators  and  stairways  shall not be  obstructed  by tenants or used by
     tenants  for any  purpose  other than for  ingress to and egress from their
     respective premises.  The driveways,  sidewalks,  halls,  passages,  exits,
     entrances,  elevators  and  stairways  are not  for the use of the  general
     public and  Landlord  shall in all cases  retain  the right to control  and
     prevent  access thereto by all persons whose  presence,  in the judgment of
     Landlord,  shall be  prejudicial to the safety,  character,  reputation and
     interests  of the  Building,  the Project and its  tenants,  provided  that
     nothing  herein  contained  shall be  construed  to prevent  such access to
     persons with whom any tenant  normally deals in the ordinary course of such
     tenant's business unless such persons are engaged in illegal activities. No
     tenant, and no employees or invitees of any tenant,  shall go upon the roof
     of any  Building,  except as  authorized  by  Landlord.  No tenant,  and no
     employees  or invitees of any tenant  shall move any common area  furniture
     without Landlord's consent.

2.   No sign, placard,  banner, picture, name,  advertisement or notice, visible
     from the  exterior of the  Premises or the  Building or the common areas of
     the Building shall be inscribed,  painted, affixed,  installed or otherwise
     displayed  by Tenant  either on its Premises or any part of the Building or
     Project  without the prior written  consent of Landlord in Landlord's  sole
     and absolute  discretion.  Landlord shall have the right to remove any such
     sign, placard,  banner,  picture,  name,  advertisement,  or notice without
     notice to and at the expense of Tenant,  which were  installed or displayed
     in  violation  of this rule.  If Landlord  shall have given such consent to
     Tenant at any time,  whether  before or after  the  execution  of  Tenant's
     Lease,  such consent  shall in no way operate as a waiver or release of any
     of the  provisions  hereof or of the  Lease,  and shall be deemed to relate
     only to the particular sign, placard,  banner, picture, name, advertisement
     or notice so  consented  to by  Landlord  and  shall  not be  construed  as
     dispensing with the necessity of obtaining the specific  written consent of
     Landlord  with respect to any other such sign,  placard,  banner,  picture,
     name, advertisement or notice.

     All  approved  signs or  lettering  on doors  and walls  shall be  printed,
     painted,  affixed  or  inscribed  at the  expense  of Tenant by a person or
     vendor  approved by Landlord  and shall be removed by Tenant at the time of
     vacancy at Tenant's  expense.  All signage  must  conform  with the City of
     Carlsbad and Carlsbad Ranch Specific Plan signage restrictions.

3.   The directory of the Building or Project will be provided  exclusively  for
     the display of the name and  location  of tenants  only for the use thereof
     and to exclude any other names therefrom.

4.   No  curtains,   draperies,  blinds,  shutters,  shades,  screens  or  other
     coverings,  awnings,  hangings or decorations shall be attached to, hung or
     placed in, or used in connection  with,  any window or door on the Premises
     without the prior written consent of Landlord.  In any event with the prior
     written consent of Landlord,  all such items shall be installed  inboard of
     Landlord's standard window covering and shall in no way be visible from the
     exterior of the Building.  All electrical  ceiling fixtures hung in offices
     or spaces along the perimeter of the Building must be  fluorescent  or of a
     quality,  type,  design,  and bulb color approved by Landlord.  No articles
     shall be placed or kept on the window  sills so as to be  visible  from the
     exterior  of the  Building.  No  articles  shall be  placed  against  glass
     partitions  or  doors  which  Landlord  considers  unsightly  from  outside
     Tenant's Premises.

5.   Landlord  reserves  the right to exclude from the Building and the Project,
     between  the  hours of 6 p.m.  and 8 a.m.  and at all  hours on  Saturdays,
     Sundays  and legal  holidays,  all  persons  who are not  tenants  or their
     accompanied  guests in the Building.  Each tenant shall be responsible  for
     all  persons  for whom it allows to enter the  Building  or the Project and
     shall be liable to Landlord for all acts of such persons.

     Landlord  and its  agents  shall not be liable  for  damages  for any error
     concerning the admission to, or exclusion from, the Building or the Project
     of any person.

     During the  continuance of any invasion,  mob, riot,  public  excitement or
     other circumstance  rendering such action advisable in Landlord's  opinion,
     Landlord  reserves the right (but shall not be obligated) to prevent access
     to the Building and the Project during the continuance of that event by any
     means it considers  appropriate for the safety of tenants and protection of
     the Building, property in the Building and the Project.

6.   All  cleaning  and  janitorial  services  for the Building and the Premises
     shall be provided  exclusively  through  Landlord.  Except with the written
     consent of  Landlord,  no person or persons  other than those  approved  by
     Landlord  shall be  permitted  to enter the  Building  for the  purpose  of
     cleaning the same.  Tenant shall not cause any unnecessary  labor by reason
     of Tenant's  carelessness or indifference in the preservation of good order
     and cleanliness of its Premises. Landlord shall in no way be responsible to
     Tenant for any loss of property on the Premises,  however occurring, or for
     any damage done to Tenant's  property by the janitor or any other  employee
     or any other person.

7.   Tenant  shall see that all doors of its  Premises  are closed and  securely
     locked and must observe  strict care and caution that all water  faucets or
     water apparatus,  coffee pots or other heat-generating devices are entirely
     shut off before  Tenant or its employees  leave the Premises,  and that all
     utilities  shall  likewise be carefully shut off, so as to prevent waste or
     damage. Tenant shall be responsible for any damage or injuries sustained by
     other  tenants or  occupants  of the Building or Project or by Landlord for
     noncompliance with this rule. On multiple-tenancy floors, all tenants shall
     keep the door or doors to the Building corridors closed at all times except
     for ingress and egress.

8.   Tenant shall not use any method of heating or  air-conditioning  other than
     that supplied by Landlord.  As more specifically provided in Tenant's lease
     of  the   Premises,   Tenant   shall  not  waste   electricity,   water  or
     air-conditioning  and agrees to cooperate fully with Landlord to assure the
     most effective  operation of the Building's  heating and  air-conditioning,
     and shall refrain from  attempting  to adjust any controls  other than room
     thermostats installed for Tenant's use.

9.   Landlord  will furnish  Tenant free of charge with two keys to each door in
     the  Premises.  Landlord  may make a reasonable  charge for any  additional
     keys, and Tenant shall not make or have made additional keys.  Tenant shall
     not alter any lock or access device or install a new or additional  lock or
     access  device  or bolt on any  door of its  Premises,  without  the  prior
     written  consent of Landlord.  If Landlord  shall give its consent,  Tenant
     shall in each case furnish  Landlord with a key for any such lock.  Tenant,
     upon the termination of its tenancy, shall deliver to Landlord the keys for
     all doors which have been furnished to Tenant,  and in the event of loss of
     any keys so furnished, shall pay Landlord therefor.

10.  The restrooms,  toilets,  urinals, wash bowls and other apparatus shall not
     be used for any purpose other than that for which they were constructed and
     no foreign  substance of any kind whatsoever shall be thrown into them. The
     expense of any breakage,  stoppage,  or damage  resulting from violation of
     this rule shall be borne by the tenant who, or whose employees or invitees,
     shall have caused the breakage, stoppage, or damage.

11.  Tenant  shall not use or keep in or on the  Premises,  the  Building or the
     Project any kerosene,  gasoline,  or inflammable  or  combustible  fluid or
     material.

12.  Tenant shall not use, keep or permit to be used or kept in its Premises any
     foul or noxious gas or substance. Tenant shall not allow the Premises to be
     occupied  or used in a manner  offensive  or  objectionable  to Landlord or
     other occupants of the Building by reason of noise, odors and/or vibrations
     or  interfere  in any way  with  other  tenants  or those  having  business
     therein,  nor shall any animals or birds be brought or kept in or about the
     Premises, the Building, or the Project.

     that use by the tenant of Underwriters' Laboratory (UL) approved equipment,
     refrigerators  and  microwave  ovens  may be used in the  Premises  for the
     preparation of coffee,  tea, hot chocolate and similar  beverages,  storing
     and heating food for tenants and their  employees  shall be permitted.  All
     uses must be in  accordance  with all  applicable  federal,  state and city
     laws, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations and the Lease.

14.  Except with the prior written  consent of Landlord,  Tenant shall not sell,
     or permit  the sale,  at retail,  of  newspapers,  magazines,  periodicals,
     theater  tickets or any other goods or  merchandise  in or on the Premises,
     nor shall  Tenant carry on, or permit or allow any employee or other person
     to carry on,  the  business  of  stenography,  typewriting  or any  similar
     business  in or from the  Premises  for the  service  or  accommodation  of
     occupants of any other portion of the  Building,  nor shall the Premises be
     used for the storage of  merchandise or for  manufacturing  of any kind, or
     the business of a public barber shop, beauty parlor, nor shall the Premises
     be used for any illegal, improper, immoral or objectionable purpose, or any
     business  or activity  other than that  specifically  provided  for in such
     Tenant's Lease. Tenant shall not accept hairstyling,  barbering, shoeshine,
     nail, massage or similar services in the Premises or common areas except as
     authorized by Landlord.

15.  If  Tenant  requires  telegraphic,  telephonic,  telecommunications,   data
     processing,  burglar alarm or similar services,  it shall first obtain, and
     comply with,  Landlord's  instructions in their  installation.  The cost of
     purchasing,  installation  and  maintenance of such services shall be borne

                              IMPROVEMENT AGREEMENT

                  This Lease  Improvement  Agreement  ("Improvement  Agreement")
sets forth the terms and  conditions  relating  to  construction  of the initial
tenant  improvements  described  in the Plans to be  prepared  and  approved  as
provided below (the "Tenant  Improvements")  in the Premises.  Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise  defined  herein shall have the meanings set forth in the
Lease (the "Lease") to which this Improvement  Agreement is attached and forms a
part.

1.       Base Building Work. The "Base Building Work" described on Schedule 1 to
         this Exhibit C, has been performed by Landlord at Landlord's  sole cost
         and expense.  No amount of said cost and expense shall be deducted from
         the Tenant Improvement Allowance (defined in Paragraph 4.2 below).

2.       Plans and Specifications.

                  2.1.   Landlord   shall  retain  the  services  of  the  space
         planner/architect  designated  by  Landlord  (the "Space  Planner")  to
         prepare a detailed space plan (the "Space Plan") mutually  satisfactory
         to Landlord and Tenant for the construction of the Tenant  Improvements
         in the Premises.  Tenant shall approve or disapprove the Space Plan and
         any  proposed  revisions  thereto in writing  within three (3) business
         days after receipt  thereof,  which approval shall not be  unreasonably
         withheld.

                  2.2.  Based on the approved  Space Plan,  Landlord shall cause
         the Space Planner to prepare detailed plans, specifications and working
         drawings for the construction of the Tenant Improvements (the "Plans").
         Landlord  and Tenant shall  diligently  pursue the  preparation  of the
         Plans.  Tenant shall approve or  disapprove  the Plans and any proposed
         revisions   thereto,   including  the  estimated  cost  of  the  Tenant
         Improvements,  in writing  within three (3) business days after receipt
         thereof.  If Tenant  fails to approve or  disapprove  the Space Plan or
         Plans or any revisions thereto within the time limits specified herein,
         Tenant shall be deemed to have  approved the same.  Landlord and Tenant
         shall  use  diligent  efforts  to cause  the  final  Plans and the cost
         estimate  to be  prepared  and  approved no later than thirty (30) days
         after the execution of the Lease.

                  2.3.  Notwithstanding   Landlord's  preparation,   review  and
         approval  of the Space  Plan and the Plans and any  revisions  thereto,
         Landlord shall have no responsibility  or liability  whatsoever for any
         errors or omissions  contained in the Space Plan or Plans, or to verify
         dimensions or conditions, or for the quality, design or compliance with
         applicable   Regulation  of  any  improvements   described  therein  or
         constructed in accordance therewith.  Landlord hereby assigns to Tenant
         all  warranties  and  guarantees by the Space Planner or the contractor
         who  constructs  the  Tenant   Improvements   relating  to  the  Tenant
         Improvements.  In the event Tenant has claims against Landlord relating
         to,  or  arising  out of the  design or  construction  of,  the  Tenant
         Improvements, then Paragraph 10.4 of the Lease shall apply.

3.       Specifications for Standard Tenant Improvements.

3.1.     Specifications  and quantities of standard  building  components  which
         will  comprise  and  be  used  in  the   construction   of  the  Tenant

         C. As used herein,  "Standards" or "Building  Standards" shall mean the
         standards for a particular  item selected from time to time by Landlord
         for the  Building,  including  those  set forth on  Schedule  2 of this
         Exhibit C, or such other standards of equal or better quality as may be
         mutually agreed between Landlord and Tenant in writing.

                  3.2. No deviations  from the Standards are  permitted,  unless
         approved or denoted in the Plans.

4.       Tenant Improvement Cost.

                  4.1. The cost of the Tenant Improvements shall, subject to
         Paragraph  4.2  below,  be  paid  for  by  Tenant  including,   without
         limitation,   the  cost  of:   Standards;   space  plans  and  studies;
         architectural  and  engineering  fees;  permits,  approvals  and  other
         governmental   fees;   labor,   material,   equipment   and   supplies;
         construction   fees  and  other  amounts   payable  to  contractors  or
         subcontractors;   taxes;   off-site   improvements;   remediation   and
         preparation   of  the   Premises   for   construction   of  the  Tenant
         Improvements;  taxes; filing and recording fees; premiums for insurance
         and  bonds;   financing  costs;  and all other  costs
         expended  or  to  be  expended  in  the   construction  of  the  Tenant
         Improvements,  including  those  costs  incurred  for  construction  of
         elements of the Tenant Improvements in the Premises, which construction
         was  performed by Landlord  prior to the  execution of the Lease or for
         materials  comprising the Tenant  Improvements  which were purchased by
         Landlord prior to the execution of the Lease; and an administration fee
         of five  percent (5%) of the total cost of the Tenant Improvements.

                  4.2.  Provided  Tenant  is not in  default  under  the  Lease,
         including  this  Improvement  Agreement,  Landlord  shall  contribute a
         one-time  tenant  improvement  allowance not to exceed  Thirty  Dollars
         ($30.00) per useable square foot ($30.00 x  approximately  8,702 usable
         square  foot =  $261,074.00)  ("Tenant  Improvement  Allowance")  to be
         credited   by  Landlord   toward  the  cost  of  the   initial   Tenant
         Improvements. If the cost of the Tenant Improvements exceeds the Tenant
         Improvement  Allowance,  Tenant  shall pay  Landlord  such  excess cost
         within five (5) business days after Landlord's notice to Tenant of such
         excess  cost.  No  credit  shall be given to  Tenant if the cost of the
         Tenant Improvements is less than the Tenant Improvement Allowance.

                  4.3. If the cost of the Tenant  Improvements  increases  after
         the  Tenant's  approval  of the  Plans due to the  requirements  of any
         governmental  agency or  applicable  Regulation  or any  other  reason,
         Tenant shall pay Landlord the amount of such  increase  within five (5)
         business days after notice from Landlord of such increase.

                  4.4.  If Tenant  requests  any  change(s)  in the Plans  after
         approval of the estimate of the cost of the Tenant Improvements and any
         such  requested   changes  are  approved  by  Landlord  in  writing  in
         Landlord's  sole  discretion,  Landlord shall advise Tenant promptly of
         any cost increases and/or delays such approved  change(s) will cause in
         the  construction of the Tenant  Improvements.  Tenant shall approve or
         disapprove  any or all such  change(s)  within three (3) business  days
         after notice from Landlord of such cost increases and/or delays. To the
         extent  Tenant   disapproves   any  such  cost  increase  and/or  delay
         attributable  thereto,  Landlord  shall  have  the  right,  in its sole
         discretion,  to  disapprove  Tenant's  request  for any  changes to the
         approved Plans. If the cost of the Tenant Improvements  increases above
         the Tenant  Improvement  Allowance  due to any  changes in the  Plan(s)
         requested  by  Tenant,  Tenant  shall pay  Landlord  the amount of such
         increase  within ten (10)  business  days after notice from Landlord of
         such increase and Tenant's  approval  thereof in  accordance  with this
         Paragraph 4.4.

                  5.1.  Upon  Tenant's  approval  of  the  Plans  including  the
         estimate of the cost of the Tenant  Improvements and Landlord's

Page 17 of 22

         receipt of payment of any such  estimated  cost exceeding the amount of
         the Tenant Improvement  Allowance,  Landlord shall cause its contractor
         to proceed to secure a building permit and commence construction of the
         Tenant Improvements  provided that Tenant shall cooperate with Landlord
         in  executing   permit   applications   and  performing  other  actions
         reasonably  necessary to enable Landlord to obtain any required permits
         or  certificates of occupancy;  and provided  further that the Building
         has in Landlord's discretion reached the stage of construction where it
         is appropriate to commence  construction of the Tenant  Improvements in
         the Premises.

                  5.2.  Landlord  shall not be liable for any direct or indirect
         damages suffered by Tenant as a result of delays in construction beyond
         Landlord's  reasonable control,  including,  but not limited to, delays
         due to strikes  or  unavailability  of  materials  or labor,  or delays
         caused by Tenant (including delays by the Space Planner, the contractor

         Lease shall be deemed to be  accelerated by the total number of days of
         Tenant  delays  described  in (a)  through (c) above  (each,  a "Tenant
         Delay"),  calculated in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 6.2
         below.

                  6.2.  If the  Term  of the  Lease  has not  already  commenced
         pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of the Lease and  substantial
         completion  of the Tenant  Improvements  has been delayed on account of
         any Tenant  Delays,  then upon  actual  substantial  completion  of the
         Tenant Improvements (as defined in Paragraph 2 of the Lease),  Landlord
         shall notify  Tenant in writing of the date  substantial  completion of
         the Tenant Improvements would have occurred but for such Tenant Delays,
         and such date shall  thereafter  be deemed to be the Term  Commencement
         Date for all  purposes  under the Lease.  Tenant shall pay to Landlord,
         within three (3)  business  days after  receipt of such written  notice
         (which notice shall include a summary of Tenant  Delays),  the per diem
         Base  Rent  times  the  number  of  days  between  the  date  the  Term
         Commencement  Date would  have  otherwise  occurred  but for the Tenant
         Delays (as  determined by the Space Planner or Landlord's  contractor),
         and  the  date  of  actual   substantial   completion   of  the  Tenant
         Improvements.

                  6.3.  Promptly  after  substantial  completion  of the  Tenant
         Improvements,  Landlord  shall give  notice to Tenant and Tenant  shall
         conduct an inspection of the Premises with a representative of Landlord
         and develop with such  representative  of Landlord a punchlist of items
         of the  Tenant  Improvements  that  are not  complete  or that  require
         corrections.  Upon receipt of such  punchlist,  Landlord  shall proceed
         diligently to remedy such items at Landlord's cost and expense provided
         such items are part of the Tenant  Improvements  to be  constructed  by
         Landlord  hereunder  and  are  otherwise   consistent  with  Landlord's
         obligations  under this  Improvement  Agreement and provided Tenant has
         fully paid Landlord for the cost of the Tenant  Improvements  exceeding
         the Tenant Improvement Allowance (with any dispute between Landlord and
         Tenant  pertaining  thereto  to be  resolved  by the Space  Planner  or
         Landlord's  general  contractor).  Substantial  completion shall not be
         delayed notwithstanding delivery of any such punchlist.

                  6.4.  A  default  under  this   Improvement   Agreement  shall
         constitute a default under the Lease, and the parties shall be entitled
         to all  rights and  remedies  under the Lease in the event of a default
         hereunder by the other party (notwithstanding that the Term thereof has
         not commenced).

         property damage liability occurring in or about the Premises or arising
         out of the use and  occupancy  of the Premises or the Project by Tenant
         or any Tenant Party. Such insurance shall include contractual liability

         shall have the right to require Tenant to increase the amount or change
         the types of  insurance  coverage  required  under this  Exhibit D. All
         insurance  policies  required to be carried by Tenant  under this Lease
         shall be written by companies rated AVII or better in "Best's Insurance

         Deductible  amounts under all insurance policies required to be carried
         by Tenant  under this Lease shall not exceed  $10,000  per  occurrence.
         Tenant  shall  deliver to Landlord  on or before the Term  Commencement
         Date,  and  thereafter at least thirty (30) days before the  expiration
         dates of the expired policies,  certified copies of Tenant's  insurance
         policies,  or a certificate  evidencing  the same issued by the insurer

         deliver such  policies or  certificates,  Landlord  may, at  Landlord's
         option and in addition to Landlord's  other  remedies in the event of a
         default by Tenant under the Lease,  procure the same for the account of
         Tenant,  and the cost  thereof  (with  interest  thereon at the Default
         Rate) shall be paid to Landlord as additional rent.
