                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The consolidated  financial statements are unaudited and reflect all adjustments
(consisting  only  of  normal  recurring  accruals)  that,  in  the  opinion  of
management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
period.  The  results  of  operations  for the  current  interim  period are not
necessarily  indicative  of results to be expected  for the current  year or any
other period.  Certain  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the fiscal
1999 presentation.

These consolidated  financial  statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated  financial statements and notes thereto included in Electronic Arts
Inc. (the "Company")  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March
31, 1998 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  ("Commission") on
June 26, 1998.

Note 2. Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year.

Note 3. Inventories

Inventories  are stated at the lower of cost or market.  Inventories at June 30,
1998 and March 31, 1998 consisted of (in thousands):

Note 6. Comprehensive Income

During the first quarter the Company adopted  Statement of Financial  Accounting
Standards No. 130,  "Reporting  Comprehensive  Income"  ("SFAS  130").  SFAS 130
requires items of other comprehensive income be classified, net of income taxes,
by their nature in the financial  statements.  Prior year  financial  statements
have been  reclassified  to conform  to the  requirements  of SFAS 130.  For the
Company,   other  comprehensive   income  includes  primarily  foreign  currency
translation adjustments and unrealized gains on investments. Total comprehensive
income  for the three  months  ended June 30,  1998 and 1997 was as follows  (in
thousands):

Note 7. Investments

In May 1998, the Company and Square Co., Ltd.  ("Square"),  a third-party  video
game console  software  publisher in Japan,  completed  the formation of two new
joint  ventures in North  America and Japan.  In North  America,  the  companies
formed Square  Electronic  Arts, LLC, which has exclusive  publishing  rights in
North America for future  interactive  entertainment  titles  created by Square.
Additionally, the Company has the exclusive right to distribute in North America
products published by this joint venture. The Company contributed $3,000,000 and
owns a 30% minority  interest in this joint  venture while Square owns 70%. This
joint venture is accounted for under the equity method.

In Japan, the companies established  Electronic Arts Square KK ("EA Square KK"),
which will  localize and publish in Japan the  Company's  properties  originally
created in North  America  and Europe,  as well as develop and publish  original
video games in Japan.  The Company  contributed cash and other assets and owns a
70% majority ownership interest, while Square owns 30%. Accordingly, the assets,
liabilities  and  results of  operations  for EA Square KK are  included  in the
Company's  Consolidated  Balance Sheets and Results of Operations  since June 1,
1998,  the date of  formation.  Square's  30%  interest in EA Square KK has been
reflected as "Minority  interest in consolidated joint venture" on the Company's
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Additionally,  during the quarter ended June 30, 1998, the Company  acquired two
software  development  companies.  In connection  with these  acquisitions,  the
Company incurred a charge of $2,279,000 for acquired in-process technology.  The
charge was made after the Company  concluded that the in-process  technology had
not reached  technological  feasibility and had no alternative  future use after
taking into  consideration  the potential for usage of the software in different
products and resale of the software.

Note 8. Earnings Per Share

The following summarizes the computation of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS") and
Diluted   EPS.   Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net   earnings   divided  by  the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method.  Due to the loss  reported  for the three  months  ended June 30,  1997,
dilutive stock options have been excluded from the Diluted EPS  calculation  (in
thousands except per share amounts):

Note 9.  New Accounting Pronouncement

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", which establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  SFAS 133
is effective for all fiscal  quarters of all fiscal years  beginning  after June
15, 1999.  The Company is  determining  the effect of SFAS 133 on its  financial
statements.

Note 10. Subsequent Event

In July 1998,  the Company  completed  the  acquisition  of ABC  Software AG, an
independent  distributor of entertainment,  edutainment and application software
in  Switzerland  and Austria for  approximately  $16.5 million in cash and other
consideration. The transaction will be accounted for under the purchase method.

Item 2.  Management's   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and
         Results of Operations

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in particular Management's Discussion and
Analysis of  Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations  contains  forward
looking statements  regarding future events or the future financial  performance
of the  Company  that  involve  certain  risks and  uncertainties  discussed  in
"Factors  Affecting Future  Performance"  below at pages 19 to 23, as well as in
the  Company's  Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal  year ended March 31,
1998 as filed with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  on June 26, 1998.
Actual events or the actual future results of the Company may differ  materially
from any forward looking statement due to such risks and uncertainties.

Consolidated Net Revenues
     Three Months Ended                 $178,221,000   $123,712,000      44.1%

International Net Revenues
     Three Months Ended                 $109,107,000    $67,460,000      61.7%
       as a percentage of net revenues         61.2%          54.5%

North America Net Revenues
     Three Months Ended                  $69,114,000    $56,252,000      22.9%
       as a percentage of net revenues         38.8%          45.5%

The Company derives revenues primarily from shipments of entertainment software,
which   includes  EA  Studio   Compact  Disk  ("CD")   products  for   dedicated
entertainment  systems  ("CD-video  games"),  EA  Studio  CD  personal  computer
products  ("PC-CD"),  EA Studio  cartridge  products and Affiliated Label ("AL")
products that are published by third parties and  distributed by EA. The Company
also derives  revenues from  licensing of EA Studio  products and AL products to
hardware companies ("OEMs") and online subscription revenues.

International net revenues increased $41,647,000,  or 61.7% for the three months
ended June 30,  1998  compared to the same  period  last year.  The  increase in
international  revenues for this period was  primarily due to growth in European
net revenues  consisting of higher sales of PlayStation  and Nintendo 64 ("N64")
products.  This increase was partially  offset by a decrease in international AL
sales.  Total net revenues in Europe were $86,794,000 for the three months ended
June 30, 1998 compared to $52,680,000 in the same period last year.

European PlayStation sales increased $31,501,000, or 244.0% for the three months
ended  June 30,  1998  compared  to the prior  year due to the  increase  in the
installed  base of this  platform  and the  release  of a key title  during  the
quarter.  N64 net revenues  increased  $11,141,000 to $12,615,000  for the three
months ended June 30, 1998. Both  PlayStation and N64 revenues  increased due to
sales of World Cup 98.  This  increase  was offset by a  decrease  in AL product
sales of $4,814,000 due to the release of successful  titles from two affiliates
in the prior year. Additionally, 16-bit product revenues decreased 


                                       11
<PAGE>

$2,836,000  as a  result  of the  completed  transition  to  32-bit  and  64-bit
platforms. Though Europe's net revenues are expected to grow in fiscal 1999, the
Company does not expect to maintain these growth rates.

Net  revenues  for Japan  increased  in the first  quarter  of 1999 by 182.7% to
$13,950,000  compared to $4,934,000 in the same period last year due to sales of
FIFA:  Road to World Cup 98 on both the  PlayStation  and N64 platforms.  Though
Japan's net revenues  are expected to grow in fiscal 1999,  the Company does not
expect to maintain these growth rates.

Sales in the Asia Pacific region  decreased by 15.1% to $8,363,000 for the three
months ended June 30, 1998  compared to $9,846,000 in the same period last year.
The  decrease  was  attributable  to lower sales of PC-CD and  Affiliated  Label
titles  partially  offset by an  increase  in  PlayStation  sales.  PC-CD  sales
decreased  $1,701,000  due to fewer  releases  for this  platform in the quarter
ended June 1998  compared to two key  releases in the same period last year.  AL
revenues decreased $1,238,000 due to the loss of revenues from Creative Wonders,
LLC ("Creative  Wonders") products which was sold in the third quarter of fiscal
1998 and a decrease in sales of other affiliates. PlayStation revenues increased
$1,299,000 due to sales of new releases during the quarter.

North America net revenues increased $12,862,000,  or 22.9% for the three months
ended June 30,  1998  compared to the same  period  last year  primarily  due to
increased  sales of  PlayStation  titles,  a key  release  for the N64 and, to a
lesser  degree,  online  subscription  revenues.  This  increase  was  offset by
decreases in Affiliated Label, PC-CD and Sega Saturn ("Saturn") net revenues.

North America PlayStation sales reflected the increase in installed base of this
console, the release of three titles for this platform and strong catalog sales.
Total North America PlayStation revenues increased  $15,917,000 or 73.9% for the
three month period.  N64 net revenues in North America were $6,050,000,  or 8.8%
for the three months ended June 30, 1998 and were  primarily  comprised of sales
of World Cup 98 which was released in the first  quarter of fiscal 1999.  Online
subscription  revenues were $2,312,000 for the three months ended June 30, 1998.
The Company  released its first online  product,  Ultima Online,  in the quarter
ended September 30, 1997.

The increase in North America net revenues was partially offset by a decrease in
Affiliated  Label,  PC-CD and Saturn net  revenues.  Affiliated  Label  revenues
decreased  $4,957,000,  or 51.8%  for the  three  months  ended  June  30,  1998
primarily due to the loss of revenues from Creative  Wonders products as well as
decreased  sales of  NovaLogic,  Inc.  titles,  which had a key  release  in the
comparable  prior  year  period.  For the  quarter  ended June 30,  1998,  PC-CD
revenues decreased $4,146,000, or 21.0% primarily due to fewer releases compared
to the same period last year as well as a decline in sales of Maxis titles.

      as a percentage of net revenues          54.0%         34.9%

The Company  released  three  32-bit  CD-video  game  products  during the first
quarter of fiscal 1999 comprised solely of titles for the PlayStation, including
World Cup 98,  Road Rash 3D and  NASCAR 98 50th  Anniversary,  compared  to four
PlayStation  and two Saturn games in the same period last year.  The increase in
32-bit sales for the three months ended June 30, 1998 compared to the prior year
was  attributable  to the greater  installed base of PlayStation  consoles,  the
related  release of key titles for this  platform  during the quarter and strong
catalog sales.

For the three months ended June 30, 1998, the 32-bit videogame  revenue increase
was primarily attributable to PlayStation sales which were $95,957,000, compared
to  $39,017,000  for the three months ended June 30, 1997.  The Company  expects
revenues from  PlayStation  products to continue to grow in fiscal 1999,  but as
revenues for these  products  increase,  the Company does not expect to maintain
these growth rates.

Net  revenues  from the sale of other  32-bit  products  were  $287,000  for the
quarter ended June 30, 1998  compared to  $4,213,000  for the same period in the
prior year.

Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony  Agreement"),  as amended,  the
Company is  authorized  to develop and  distribute  CD-based  software  products
compatible with the  PlayStation.  Pursuant to the Sony  Agreement,  the Company
engages  Sony  to  supply  PlayStation  CDs  for  distribution  by the  Company.
Accordingly,   the  Company  has  limited  ability  to  control  its  supply  of
PlayStation CD products or the timing of their delivery. See Hardware Companies,

The Company released two PC-CD titles in the first quarter of the current fiscal
year for the IBM personal  computer and  compatibles  including World Cup 98 and
Dungeon Keeper Gold, compared to six for the same period last year. The decrease
in sales  of  PC-CD  products  for the  three  months  ended  June  30,  1998 is
attributable  to fewer  releases in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to
three key releases in the same period last year.  PC-CD  revenues also decreased
due to a decline in sales of Maxis titles.

     Three Months Ended                 $20,947,000    $2,333,000       N/M
       as a percent of net revenues           11.8%          1.9%

The  increase  in N64  revenues  is due to the  release  of World  Cup 98 in the
quarter ended June 30, 1998 compared to no new releases in the comparable  prior
year  quarter.  In March 1997,  the Company  signed a licensing  agreement  with
Nintendo (the "N64  Agreement")  to develop,  publish and market  certain sports
products for the N64. Sales of N64 products are expected to grow in fiscal 1999,
but as revenues for these  products  increase,  they may not grow at the current
rate.

Under  the  terms  of  the  N64  Agreement,  the  Company  engages  Nintendo  to
manufacture its N64 cartridges for distribution by the Company. Accordingly, the
Company has little ability to control its supply of N64 cartridges or the timing
of their delivery. A shortage of microchips or other factors outside the control
of the Company could impair the Company's  ability to obtain an adequate  supply
of cartridges.

In connection with the Company's purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution in
North America,  Nintendo requires the Company to provide  irrevocable letters of
credit prior to Nintendo's  acceptance  of purchase  orders from the Company for
purchases of these cartridges.  For purchases of N64 cartridges for distribution
in Japan and  Europe,  Nintendo  requires  the  Company  to make cash  deposits.
Furthermore,  Nintendo  maintains  a  policy  of not  accepting  returns  of N64
cartidges.  Because of these and other factors,  the carrying of an inventory of
cartridges entails significant capital and risk. See Hardware Companies, below.


License/OEM Net Revenues

                                          June 30,         June 30,
                                            1998             1997     % change
                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                      $  4,757,000    $  3,368,000    41.2%
  as a percentage of net revenues               2.7%            2.7%

The  increase in  license/OEM  net  revenues for the three months ended June 30,
1998 compared to the same period last year was primarily a result of an increase
in the licensing of the Company's products in Europe and North America.

Other Product Net Revenues

                                          June 30,         June 30,
                                            1998             1997     % change
                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                      $  2,249,000    $  3,639,000   (38.2%)
  as a percentage of net revenues               1.3%            2.9%

The decrease in other product revenues is primarily due to the transition of the
16-bit  video game market to the next  generation  of 32-bit and 64-bit  systems
offset by an increase in online subscription  revenues. As the 16-bit video game
market has made the transition to next generation 32-bit and 64-bit systems, the
Company  does not expect to release  any new  16-bit  titles in fiscal  1999 and
revenues from the sales of 16-bit products


                                       14

in fiscal 1999 are not expected to be  significant.  This decrease was offset by
Ultima Online subscription  revenues, the Company's first online game introduced
in the second quarter of fiscal 1998.

Affiliated Label Net Revenues

                                          June 30,         June 30,
                                            1998             1997     % change
                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                     $ 14,814,000    $  26,042,000     (43.1%)
  as a percentage of net revenues              8.3%            21.1%

The  decrease in  Affiliated  Label net revenues for the three months ended June
30,  1998  compared  to the same  period  last  year  was due to lower  sales of
Affiliated Label products worldwide. The decrease was primarily due to decreases
in sales of AL  products  from  NovaLogic,  Inc.  which had a key release in the
prior comparable period, and Creative Wonders,  LLC, which was sold in the third
fiscal quarter of 1998.

Cost of Goods Sold

                                          June 30,         June 30,

                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                     $ 87,589,000    $  62,312,000     40.6%
  as a percentage of net revenues             49.1%            50.4%

The  decrease in costs of goods sold as a  percentage  of net  revenues  for the
three  months  ended June 30,  1998  compared  to the same  period last year was
primarily  due to  lower  AL  revenues  as  well as  lower  third  party  artist
royalties.

Marketing and Sales

                                          June 30,         June 30,

                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                     $ 33,644,000    $  26,636,000     26.3%
  as a percentage of net revenues             18.9%            21.5%

The increase in marketing and sales expenses for the three months ended June 30,
1998 was  primarily  attributable  to  increased  television,  print and  online
advertising  to support  new  releases  and  increased  cooperative  advertising
associated  with higher  revenues in North America and Europe as compared to the
prior year period. Marketing and sales expenses also increased due to additional
headcount  related  to  the  continued  expansion  of  the  Company's  worldwide
distribution  business.  Increases were partially offset by savings attributable
to the integration of Maxis in July 1997.

General and Administrative

                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                     $  15,417,000   $  11,889,000     29.7%
  as a percentage of net revenues               8.7%            9.6%

The increase in general and  administrative  expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 1998 was due  primarily to an increase in payroll and  occupancy  costs
due to the  opening of  additional  international  offices  and to  support  the
increase in growth in North America operations.

  as a percentage of net revenues               20.3%            22.4%

The  increase in research  and  development  expenses for the three months ended
June 30, 1998 was due to additional  headcount related expenses  attributable to
increased in-house development capacity,  higher development costs per title and
an increase in support for Ultima Online.  This increase was partially offset by
a decrease in Maxis' development expenses.

Charge for Acquired In-Process Technology

                                            June 30,      June 30,
                                             1998           1997     % change
                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                      $  2,279,000       $--          N/M
  as a percentage of net revenues               1.3%       N/A

In connection with the acquisition of two software development companies, in the
first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company  incurred a total charge of $2,279,000
for  acquired  in-process  technology.  This  charge was made after the  Company
concluded  that  the  in-process   technology  had  not  reached   technological
feasibility  and had no alternative  future use after taking into  consideration
the potential for usage of the software in different  products and resale of the
software.

Operating Income (Loss)

                                           June 30,      June 30,

                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                      $  3,050,000   $ (4,807,000)    N/M
  as a percentage of net revenues               1.7%          (3.9%)

Operating income was higher for the three months ended June 30, 1998 compared to
the same period last year due to  increased  revenue  and related  gross  profit
margins partially offset by increased  operating  expenses  including the charge
for acquired in-process technology.

Interest and Other Income, Net

                                       -----------------------------------------
Three Months Ended                      $  2,815,000   $  2,550,000    10.4%
  as a percentage of net revenues               1.6%           2.1%


Interest and other  income,  net,  increased for the three months ended June 30,
1998  compared  to the same period last year  primarily  due to higher  interest
income  attributable  to higher  cash  balances  as  compared  to the prior year
period. This increase was offset by a decrease in the gain on sale of marketable
securities.

  effective tax rate                           33.0%            34.5%

The  Company's  effective  tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 1998 was
lower than the comparable prior year period as a result of the higher proportion
of international income subject to a lower foreign effective tax rate.

Minority Interest in Consolidated Joint Venture

In the first  quarter of fiscal  1999,  the  Company  formed EA Square KK, a new
joint venture which will publish and distribute the Company's products in Japan.
EA Square KK is seventy percent owned by the Company and thirty percent owned by
Square Co. Ltd. ("Square"),  a third party video game console software publisher
in Japan.  The  minority  interest  for the three  months  ended  June 30,  1998
represents  Square's  30%  interest  in the net income of EA Square KK since its
inception.

For the three months ended June 30, 1997, the minority interest  represented the
35% interest in Electronic  Arts Victor  ("EAV")  owned by Victor  Entertainment
Industries,  Inc.  ("VEI").  The Company  acquired  the  remaining  35% minority
ownership  interest in EAV held by VEI in December  1997.  VEI's interest in the
net equity of EAV had fallen below zero in the three months ended June 30, 1997,
therefore  the  minority  interest  reflected  only a portion of EAV's  reported
losses.

The  increase in net income for the three months ended June 30, 1998 as compared
to the prior year  period was  primarily  related to higher  revenues  and gross
profits, offset by higher operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of June 30, 1998, the Company's working capital was $415,565,000  compared to
$408,098,000  at March 31, 1998.  Cash and short-term  investments  decreased by
approximately  $11,241,000  during the three  months  ended June 30, 1998 as the
Company  used  $4,216,000  of cash in  operations  and  $11,398,000  in  capital
expenditures offset by proceeds from the Company's employee stock programs.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns increased from $51,575,000 at March 31,
1998 to $56,008,000 at June 30, 1998.  Reserves have been charged for returns of
product and price protection  credits issued for products sold in prior periods.
Management  believes these reserves are adequate based on historical  experience
and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances.

In connection with the Company's purchases of Sony products to be distributed in
Japan,  Sony of Japan  requires  cash  deposits  totaling  one-third of purchase
orders. Additionally,  Nintendo of Japan requires cash deposits on all orders of
N64 cartridge products in Japan. In lieu of letters of credit, EA Japan utilizes
a line of credit to fund  these  deposits  for  purchases  of Sony and  Nintendo
products in Japan and for other  operating  requirements.  At June 30, 1998,  EA
Japan had no outstanding balance on this line.

The  Company's  principal  source  of  liquidity  is  $363,319,000  in cash  and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment  requirements for the foreseeable
future.

Year 2000

The  Company  is aware of the issues  associated  with the  programming  code in
existing  computer systems as the year 2000 approaches.  The "Year 2000" problem
is complex and pervasive as many  computer  systems will be affected in some way
by the rollover of the two-digit  year value to 00. Systems that do not properly
recognize such  information  could generate  erroneous data or cause a system to
fail. The Year 2000 issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen  problems
in its own computer  systems and from third parties with which the Company deals
on financial  transactions  worldwide.  Failures of the  Company's  and/or third
parties'  computer systems could have a material adverse impact on the Company's
ability to conduct business.  For example, a significant  percentage of purchase
orders  received  from  the  Company's  customers  are  computer  generated  and
electronically  transmitted.  A failure of the computer systems of the Company's
customers  to be Year 2000  compliant  could  significantly  impact  the  orders
received by the Company from such customer.

The  Company's  financial  information  systems  include an Oracle system in the
United States and Europe,  which the Company believes to be Year 2000 compliant.
The  Company  is  analyzing  its  remaining  computer  systems to  identify  any
potential Year 2000 issues and will take appropriate  corrective action based on
the results of such analysis. Management has not yet determined the cost related
to achieving Year 2000 compliance.

In  addition,  the Year 2000 could affect the ability of consumers to use the PC
based  products  sold by the  Company.  If the  computer  systems  on which  the
consumers  use  the  Company's  products  are  not  Year  2000  compliant,  such
noncompliance could affect the consumers ability to use such products.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE PERFORMANCE

Future operating results of the Company depend upon many factors and are subject
to  various  risks  and  uncertainties.   Some  of  those  important  risks  and
uncertainties  which may cause the Company's  operating results to vary or which
may  materially  and  adversely  affect the Company's  operating  results are as
follows:

The Industry and Competition. The interactive software business has historically
been a volatile and highly  dynamic  industry  affected by changing  technology,
limited  hardware  platform life cycles,  hit products,  competition,  component
supplies, seasonality, consumer spending and other economic trends. The business
is also  intensely  competitive.  A variety of  companies  offer  products  that
compete  directly  with  one or more of the  Company's  products.  These  direct
competitors  vary in size from very small companies to companies with financial,
managerial  and technical  resources  comparable to or greater than those of the
Company.  Typically,  the Company's chief competitor on dedicated game platforms
is the  hardware  manufacturer/licensor  itself,  to which the Company  must pay
royalties,  and in the case of Sony and  Nintendo,  manufacturing  charges.  For
example,  Sony has  aggressively  launched  sports  product  lines that directly
compete with the  Company's  sports  products on the  PlayStation.  In addition,
competition  for  creative  talent  has  intensified,  and  the  attraction  and
retention of key personnel by the Company is increasingly difficult.

Products.  Interactive entertainment software products typically have life spans
of only 3 to 12 months. In addition, the packaged goods market is crowded with a
large number of titles  competing for limited retail shelf space.  The Company's
future success will depend in large part on its ability to develop and introduce
new competitive products on a timely basis and, in the packaged goods market, to
get those products  distributed widely at retail. To compete  successfully,  new
products must adapt to new hardware  platforms and emerging industry  standards,
provide additional content and functionality and be successfully  distributed in
numerous changing worldwide markets. If the Company were unable, due to resource
constraints or  technological  or other  reasons,  to  successfully  develop and
distribute  such  products  in a timely  manner,  this  inability  would  have a
material adverse effect on its operating results and financial condition.

Development.  Product  development  schedules,  particularly  for  new  hardware
platforms  and high-end  multimedia  PCs are  difficult to predict  because they
involve creative  processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms and
the learning process,  research and experimentation  associated with development
for new technologies.  CD-ROM products  frequently  include more content and are
more  complex,  time-consuming  and costly to develop  and,  accordingly,  cause
additional development and scheduling risk than earlier generation products. For
example, Dungeon Keeper,  originally scheduled to ship in the quarter ended June
1996,  shipped  during the summer of 1997. In addition  Populous 3 for PC-CD and
PlayStation  were scheduled for shipment in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998
and are now  expected to ship in the fiscal year ending  March 31,  1999.  Also,
SimCity  3000,  the follow on product to SimCity  2000,  was expected to ship in
fiscal 1998, at the time of the merger with Maxis. Due to additional development
delays,  it is  anticipated  that this  product  may not ship  until the  fourth
calendar quarter of 1998.  Additionally,  development  risks for CD-ROM products
can cause particular  difficulties in predicting quarterly results because brief
manufacturing  lead times allow finalizing  products and projected release dates
late in a quarter.  The  Company's  revenues and  earnings are  dependent on its
ability  to meet  its  product  release  schedule.  Its  failure  to meet  those
schedules  could result in revenues  and earnings  which fall short of analysts'
expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

Platform Changes. A large portion of the Company's revenues are derived from the
sale of products  designed to be played on proprietary video game platforms such
as the  PlayStation  and the N64.  The  interdependent  nature of the  Company's
business  and that of its hardware  licensors

                                       19

brings significant risks to the Company's business. The success of the Company's
products is  significantly  affected by market  acceptance of the new video game
hardware  systems  and  the  life  span of  older  hardware  platforms,  and the
Company's  ability to  accurately  predict  these  factors  with respect to each
platform.  In many  cases,  the  Company  will have  expended a large  amount of
development  and  marketing  resources  on products  designed for new video game
systems  (such as the new 32-bit and 64-bit  systems) that have not yet achieved
large  installed  bases or will have  continued  product  development  for older
hardware  platforms that may have shorter life cycles than the Company expected.
Conversely,  if the  Company  does not  choose to develop  for a  platform  that
achieves  significant  market  acceptance,  or  discontinues  development  for a
platform  that has a longer  life cycle than  expected,  the  Company's  revenue
growth may be adversely  affected.  For example,  the Company has only  released
four  products  for the N64  through  June 1998 since the  introduction  of this
platform in September 1996. Additionally, the Company is developing a line of EA
SPORTS and other N64 products for release in fiscal 1999.  The Company  believes
that  investment  in products for the 32-bit  market,  including  both PC-CD and
CD-video  game  platforms   (particularly  the  PlayStation)  was  strategically
important in positioning the Company for the now completed  transition to 32-bit
machines. The Company continues to believe that such investment is important and
will  continue  its  aggressive  development  activities  for 32-bit  platforms.
Although the  PlayStation  has achieved  significant  market  acceptance  in all
geographic territories,  there can be no assurance that its growth will continue
at the present rates.  The market  acceptance of the N64,  particularly in North
America  and  Europe,  may  adversely  affect  the  growth  rate  of the  32-bit
CD-platforms.

Multiplayer  Online  Gaming.   While  the  Company  does  not  currently  derive
significant  revenues from online games,  the Company  believes that multiplayer
online gaming will become a more  significant  factor in the Company's  business
and in the interactive gaming business  generally in the future.  Online gaming,
and particularly  multiplayer  online gaming such as the Company's Ultima Online
product,  has at least four general areas of risk not currently  associated with
most packaged good sales.  First,  the speed and reliability of the internet and
the performance of the players'  internet service provider are not controlled by
the Company but impact game  performance.  Second,  in  "massively  multiplayer"
games such as Ultima Online,  unanticipated player conduct significantly affects
the  performance  of the game,  and social  issues  raised by  players'  conduct
frequently determine player  satisfaction.  The Company's ability to effectively
proctor such games is uncertain.  Third,  the current  business  model is as yet
experimental  and maybe  unsustainable;  whether  revenues  will  continue to be
sufficient to maintain the significant support,  service and product enhancement
demands of online  users is  uncertain.  The  Company has little  experience  in
pricing  strategies  for online  games or in  predicting  usage  patterns of its
customers.  Finally,  the legal  standards that may apply to online products are
uncertain; the Company has recently been sued in a class action lawsuit alleging
defects in Ultima Online,  regulation of the internet and the content it carries
is  regularly  proposed by various  legislators,  and piracy of online  games is
difficult to prosecute under existing  intellectual property laws. The viability
of this segment,  generally, and the Company's ability to compete in the segment
will depend  significantly  on these and other  factors  outside  the  Company's
control.

Hardware Companies.  The Company's contracts with hardware licensors,  which are
also some of the Company's chief competitors, often grant significant control to
the licensor over the manufacturing of the Company's products.  This fact could,
in  certain  circumstances,  leave  the  Company  unable  to  get  its  products
manufactured  and  shipped  to  customers.   In  most  events,  control  of  the
manufacturing  process by hardware  companies  increases both the  manufacturing
lead times and the  expense to the  Company  as  compared  to the lead times and
costs that the Company can achieve  independently.  For example, the Company, in
prior years,  experienced  delays in the  manufacturing of PlayStation  products
which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The results of future periods
may be affected by similar  delays.  Finally,  the Company's  contracts with its
hardware  licensors  often  require  the  Company to take  significant  risks in
holding or prepaying for its inventory of products. In particular, the Company's

                                       20

agreement  with  Nintendo  for  N64  products  requires   prepayment  of  costly
cartridge-based inventory, minimum orders and no rights of return.

Revenue and Expenses.  A  substantial  majority of the revenue of the Company in
any quarter  typically  results from orders received and products  introduced in
that quarter.  The Company's  expenses are based,  in part,  on  development  of
products to be released in the future.  Certain overhead and product development
expenses do not vary directly in relation to revenues.  This trend is increasing
as the Company increases the proportion of products developed  internally.  As a
result, the Company's  quarterly results of operations are difficult to predict,
and small delays in product deliveries may cause quarterly  revenues,  operating
results  and net income to fall  significantly  below  anticipated  levels.  The
Company typically  receives orders shortly before  shipments,  making backlog an
unreliable  indicator of quarterly  results. A shortfall in shipments at the end
of any  particular  quarter  may  cause  the  results  of that  quarter  to fall
significantly short of anticipated levels.

Gross  Margins.  Though  gross  margins  for the  Company's  products as a whole
increased  for the three months ended June 30,  1998,  the Company  expects that
margins  may be  comparable  to or decline  from  fiscal 1998 levels for several
reasons.  First,  the mix in sales of the  Company's  products has a significant
effect on gross margins. As the Company releases more N64 products,  which carry
significantly lower margins due to high cost of goods, overall gross margins may
decline.  Similarly,  if the proportion of AL revenues  increases in relation to
other revenues,  margins may also decline. Further, gross margins continue to be
affected by increases in professional and celebrity  license fees and royalties.
Also,  while the costs of  development  of new  products  for  32-bit and 64-bit
systems have increased,  overall costs of goods are not declining significantly.
For  products on  platforms  for which the  Company is required to purchase  its
goods  from the  hardware  companies,  the  Company  is unable to  achieve  cost
reductions   through   manufacturing   efficiencies,   and  in  addition,   pays
manufacturing royalties to hardware companies. Additionally,  retailers continue
to require significant price protection for products.  With an increasing number
of  titles  available  for  advanced  platforms,  such  requirements  for  price
protection may increase.  The Company also anticipates that retail and wholesale
prices for interactive entertainment products may decrease and gross margins may
be further adversely affected.

Marketing and  Distribution.  Both the video game and PC businesses  have become
increasingly  "hits"  driven.  Additional  marketing and  advertising  funds are
required to drive and support  "hit"  products,  particularly  expenditures  for
television advertising. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue
to produce "hit" titles, or that advertising for any product will increase sales
sufficiently to recoup those advertising expenses.

The Company has  stock-balancing  programs  for its personal  computer  products
that, under certain  circumstances and up to a specified  amount,  allow for the
exchange of personal computer products by resellers.  The Company also typically
provides for price  protection  for its personal  computer and video game system
products that, under certain  conditions,  allows the reseller a price reduction
from the  Company  for  unsold  products.  The  Company  maintains  a policy  of
exchanging products or giving credits, but does not give cash refunds. Moreover,
the risk of product returns may increase as new hardware  platforms  become more
popular or market factors force the Company to make changes in its  distribution
system.  The Company  monitors  and manages the volume of its sales to retailers
and  distributors  and their  inventories  as  substantial  overstocking  in the
distribution  channel  can  result  in  high  returns  or  the  requirement  for
substantial price protection in subsequent periods. The Company believes that it
provides  adequate  reserves for returns and price protection which are based on
estimated   future  returns  of  products,   taking  into  account   promotional
activities,  the timing of new product  introductions,  distributor and retailer
inventories of the Company's  products and other  factors,  and that its current
reserves will be sufficient to meet return and price protection requirements for
current  in-channel  inventory.  However,  there can be no assurance that actual
returns or price protection will not exceed the Company's reserves.  See Revenue
and Expenses, above.

                                       21

The distribution channels through which consumer software products are sold have
been   characterized   by  change,   including   consolidations   and  financial
difficulties  of certain  distributors  and  retailers  and the emergence of new
retailers  such as general mass  merchandisers.  The  development  of remote and
electronic delivery systems will create further changes. The bankruptcy or other
business  difficulties  of a distributor  or retailer could render the Company's
accounts receivable from such entity uncollectible,  which could have an adverse
effect on the  operating  results and  financial  condition of the  Company.  In
addition,  an  increasing  number of companies are competing for access to these
channels.  The Company's arrangements with its distributors and retailers may be
terminated by either party at any time without cause. Distributors and retailers
often carry  products  that compete with those of the Company.  Retailers of the
Company's   products  typically  have  a  limited  amount  of  shelf  space  and
promotional  resources for which there is intense  competition.  There can be no
assurance  that  distributors  and  retailers  will  continue  to  purchase  the
Company's  products or provide the Company's  products  with adequate  levels of
shelf space and promotional support.

Employees.  Competition  for  employees  in the  interactive  software  business
continues to be intense.  Large software and media  companies  frequently  offer
significantly  larger cash compensation than does the Company,  placing pressure
on the  Company's  base  salary  and cash  bonus  compensation.  Small  start-up
companies  such as  those  proliferating  in the  online  business  areas  offer
significant potential equity gains which are difficult for more mature companies
like the  Company  to match  without  significant  stockholder  dilution.  While
executive  turnover decreased in fiscal 1998 and for the three months ended June
30,  1998 as  compared  to  prior  periods,  many  key  executives  continue  to
experience  intense  recruiting  pressure.  There can be no  assurance  that the
Company  will be  able to  continue  to  attract  and  retain  enough  qualified
employees in the future.

Foreign  Sales and  Currency  Fluctuations.  For the three months ended June 30,
1998 and the fiscal  year  ended  March 31,  1998,  international  net  revenues
comprised  61% and 43% of total  consolidated  net revenues,  respectively.  The
Company expects  foreign sales to continue to account for a significant  portion
of the  Company's  revenues.  Such sales are  subject to  unexpected  regulatory
requirements,  tariffs  and  other  barriers.  Additionally,  foreign  sales are
primarily made in local currencies  which may fluctuate.  As a result of current
economic  conditions  in Asia,  the  Company is subject  to  additional  foreign
currency  risk.  Though the  Company  does not  currently  derive a  significant
portion  of  revenues  and  operating  profits  from  sales  in Asia  and  other
developing  countries,  the Company's  foreign currency exposure may increase as
the Company's  operations in these countries grow and if current economic trends
in Asia continue. There can be no assurance that these or other factors will not
have an adverse effect on the Company's future operating results.

Investments  in  Affiliates.  The Company has a number of equity  investments in
affiliates,  including small developers, such as Firaxis; other publishers, such
as Accolade, Inc., The 3DO Company and NovaLogic, Inc.; and new ventures such as
Mpath Interactive. Additionally, the Company has a minority investment in Square
Electronic  Arts,  LLC, a joint venture between the Company and Square Co., Ltd.
These  companies  are  generally  small and may not have  significant  financial
resources.  Financial  difficulties  for any of these  companies  could  cause a
reduction in the value of the Company's investment.

Fluctuations in Stock Price.  Due to analysts'  expectations of continued growth
and other  factors,  any  shortfall  in  earnings  could have an  immediate  and
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock in
any given period.  As a result of the factors discussed in this quarterly report
and  other  factors  that  may  arise in the  future,  the  market  price of the
Company's common stock  historically has been, and may continue to be subject to
significant  fluctuations over a short period of time. These fluctuations may be
due to  factors  specific  to the  Company,  to changes  in  analysts'  earnings
estimates, or to factors affecting the computer, software, entertainment,  media
or  electronics  industries or the securities  markets in

                                       22

general. For example,  during the fiscal year ended March 31, 1998 the price per
share of the Company's common stock ranged from $20.13 to $46.94 and from $41.63
to $54.81 during the three months ended June 30, 1998.

Seasonality.  The Company's  business is highly seasonal.  The Company typically
experiences its highest  revenues and profits in the calendar  year-end  holiday
season and a seasonal  low in revenues and profits  during the  quarters  ending
June and September.


Because  of the  foregoing  factors,  as well as  other  factors  affecting  the
Company's operating results and financial condition,  past financial performance
should  not be  considered  a  reliable  indicator  of future  performance,  and
investors  should not use historical  trends to anticipate  results or trends in
future periods.
