                      ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The condensed  consolidated  financial  statements are unaudited and reflect all
adjustments  (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) that, in the opinion
of  management,  are  necessary for a fair  presentation  of the results for the
interim period. The results of operations for the current interim period are not
necessarily  indicative  of results to be expected  for the current  year or any
other period.  Certain  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the fiscal
2001 presentation.

These condensed  consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  in
Electronic Arts Inc. (the  "Company")  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2000 as filed with the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
("Commission") on June 29, 2000.

Note 2. Fiscal Year

The  Company's  fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week  period that ends on the
Saturday  nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
2001 will contain 53 weeks. Accordingly, the results of operations for the first
half of fiscal  2001 and the first half of fiscal  2000  contain 27 weeks and 26
weeks, respectively. The results of operations for the fiscal quarter ended June
30,  2000 and the fiscal  quarter  ended June 30,  1999  contain 14 weeks and 13
weeks,  respectively.  Since the results of an additional week are not material,
and for clarity of  presentation,  all fiscal periods are treated as ending on a
calendar month.

Note 3. Approval of the Tracking Stock Proposal

On March 22, 2000, the  shareholders  of Electronic Arts voted on and approved a
proposal  (the  "Tracking  Stock  Proposal")  to authorize the issuance of a new
series of  common  stock to be  designated  as Class B common  stock  ("Tracking
Stock"),  intended to reflect the  performance  of  Electronic  Arts' online and
e-Commerce  division  ("EA.com").  As a result of the  approval of the  Tracking
Stock Proposal, Electronic Arts' existing common stock has been re-classified as
Class A  common  stock  ("Class  A  Stock")  and that  stock  will  reflect  the
performance of Electronic Arts' other businesses ("EA Core").

Note 4. Stock Split

On August 14, 2000,  the Company's  Board of Directors  authorized a two-for-one
stock split of its Class A common  stock which was  distributed  on September 8,

Note 5. Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included
in other current  assets,  was $70,366,000 and $54,970,000 at September 30, 2000
and March 31, 2000,  respectively.  The long-term portion of prepaid  royalties,
included in other assets,  was $15,735,000 and $11,373,000 at September 30, 2000

Note 8.  Segment Information

In 1999,  the Company  adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures  about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related  Information",  which supersedes SFAS No. 14,  "Financial
Reporting  for  Segments  of a Business  Enterprise".  SFAS No. 131  establishes
standards for the reporting by public business  enterprises of information about
product lines, geographic areas and major customers.  The method for determining
what  information  to report is based on the way that  management  organizes the
operating  segments  within the Company  for making  operational  decisions  and
assessments of financial  performance.  The Company's chief  operating  decision
maker is considered to be the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The CEO
reviews financial  information  presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by
disaggregated  information  about  revenues by geographic  region and by product
lines for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions  and  assessing  financial
performance.

As a result of the approval of the Tracking Stock proposal to authorize issuance
of a new series of common stock designated as Class B common stock,  intended to
reflect the performance of EA.com,  management considers EA.com to be a separate
reportable segment.  Accordingly,  prior period information has been restated to
disclose  separate  segments.  The Company  operates in two  principal  business
segments globally:

   o  Electronic Arts core ("EA Core") business segment: creation, marketing and
      distribution of entertainment software.

   o  EA.com  business   segment:   creation,   marketing  and  distribution  of
      entertainment  software  which can be played or sold  online  and  ongoing
      management of subscriptions of online games.

Please see the discussion regarding segment reporting in the MD&A.

Note 10. Earnings (Loss) Per Share

The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method.

Net income (loss) per share was calculated on a consolidated basis until Class A
common  stock and Class B common  stock were created as a result of the approval
of the Tracking Stock  Proposal,  see Note 3.  Subsequent to the approval of the
Tracking Stock  Proposal,  net income (loss) per share is computed  individually
for Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

                                   (continued)

Due to the net loss  reported for the three and six months ended  September  30,
2000, for the EA core segment, stock options have been excluded from the Diluted
EPS  calculation.  Had net  income  been  reported  in these  periods,  dilutive
potential  common shares would have been 138,087,000 and 136,614,000 for Class A
common  stock  for  the  three  and  six  months  ended   September   30,  2000,
respectively.

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
were options to purchase  805,212 and  1,318,595  shares of common stock for the
three and six months ended  September  30, 2000,  respectively,  as the options'
exercise  price was greater than the average  market price of the common shares.
For the three and six months  ended  September  30, 2000,  the  weighted-average
exercise price of the respective options was $48.60 and $44.99, respectively.

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
were options to purchase  82,000,  and 1,112,000  shares of common stock for the
three and six months ended  September  30, 1999,  respectively,  as the options'
exercise  price was greater than the average  market price of the common shares.
For the three and six months  ended  September  30, 1999,  the  weighted-average
exercise price of the respective options was $33.44 and $29.83, respectively.

Note 11.  New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  reached a consensus on issue No.
00-15  ("EITF  00-15"),  "Classification  in the  Statement of Cash Flows of the
Income  Tax  Benefit  Realized  by  a  Company  upon  Employee   Exercise  of  a
Nonqualified Stock Option". The EITF concluded that income tax benefits realized
upon an employee's  exercise of a nonqualified stock option should be classified
as an operating cash flow.  Accordingly,  the Company  reclassified tax benefits
resulting from the exercise of stock options on its  Consolidated  Statements of
Cash Flows.

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-10 ("EITF  00-10"),
"Accounting  for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs",  and concluded  that all
amounts  billed to a customer  in a sale  transaction  related to  shipping  and
handling,  if any,  represent  revenue to the vendor and,  therefore,  should be
classified  as revenue.  The  adoption of EITF 00-10 did not have a  significant
impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In May 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  issued No. 00-14 ("EITF  00-14"),
"Accounting  for Certain Sales  Incentives".  EITF 00-14 states that for a sales
incentive that will not result in a loss on the sale of a product or service,  a
vendor  should  recognize the cost of the incentive at the latter of the date at
which the  related  revenue is recorded  or the date at which the  incentive  is
offered. If the sales incentive will result in a loss on the sale of the product
or service,  the vendor should not recognize a liability for the sales incentive
until the related revenue is recognized.  Secondly, for certain sales incentives
that entitle a customer to receive a reduction

                                       17

                                   (continued)

in the price of a product  or  service  in the form of a refund or  rebate,  the
vendor  should  recognize a liability  for those  sales  incentives  based on an
estimated  amount of refunds or rebates  that may be claimed by  customers.  The
Task Force also  concluded  that the reduction in or refund of the selling price
resulting from any cash sales  incentive  should be classified as a reduction in
revenue  and  if the  sales  incentive  offered  is a free  product  or  service
delivered at the time of sale, the cost of the free product or service should be
classified  as an  expense.  The  adoption of EITF 00-14 did not have a material
impact on its results of  operations,  financial  position or cash flows for the
Company.

In March 2000, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued  Interpretation
No.  44  ("FIN  44"),  "Accounting  for  Certain  Transactions  Involving  Stock
Compensation  (an  interpretation  of APB Opinion No. 25)". FIN 44 clarifies the
application  of APB Opinion No. 25 for certain  issues:  (a) the  definition  of
employee for purposes of applying  Opinion 25, (b) the criteria for  determining
whether  a  plan  qualifies  as  a  noncompensatory  plan,  (c)  the  accounting
consequence of various  modifications  to the terms of a previously  fixed stock
option or award,  and (d) the accounting  for an exchange of stock  compensation
awards in a business combination.  Generally,  FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000.
The  adoption  of  FIN 44  did  not  have a  material  impact  on the  Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-03 ("EITF  00-03"),
"Application of AICPA SOP 97-2, "Software Revenue  Recognition," to Arrangements
That Include the Right to Use  Software  Stored on Another  Entity's  Hardware",
which  discusses  the  effect on  revenue  recognition  of a  software  vendor's
obligation to host its software that previously was licensed to a customer.  The
EITF has reached the  conclusion  that, if the customer is unable to utilize the
software on the customer's  hardware or contract with another party unrelated to
the vendor to host the  software,  then the  arrangement  with the  customer  is
outside the scope of SOP 97-2 and should be treated as a service  contract.  The
adoption of EITF 00-03 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial
position and results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-02 ("EITF  00-02"),
"Accounting for Web Site  Development  Costs".  EITF 00-02 states that all costs
relating to software used to operate a web site and relating to  development  of
initial  graphics and web page design should be accounted for using Statement of
Position ("SOP") 98-1. Under this SOP, costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage  should  be  expensed  as  incurred,  as  should  most  training  and data
conversion  costs.  External direct costs of materials and services and internal
direct  payroll-related  costs should be capitalized  once certain  criteria are
met. EITF 00-02 is effective for all fiscal  quarters  beginning  after June 30,
2000. The Company's accounting policy for internal-use  software, as required by
SOP 98-1, incorporated the requirements of EITF 00-02.

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101("SAB 101"),  "Revenue  Recognition," which outlines
the basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance
for  presentation of revenue and for disclosure  related to revenue  recognition
policies in financial  statements  filed with the SEC. SAB 101 is effective  the
fourth  fiscal  quarter of fiscal  years  beginning  after  December 15,

1999 as amended by SAB 101B.  The Company  believes the adoption of SAB 101 will
not have a material  impact on the Company's  financial  position and results of
operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",   as  amended  by  SFAS  137
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the
Effective  Date of FASB  Statement No. 133 - an Amendment of FASB  Statement No.
133" and SFAS 138  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments and Certain
Hedging  Activities - an Amendment of FASB  Statement  No. 133" which  establish
accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments  and hedging
activities. The terms of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 are effective as of the beginning
of the first  quarter of the fiscal  year  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The
Company  is  determining  the effect of SFAS 133,  137 and 138 on its  financial
statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained  for  Internal  Use".  SOP 98-1  requires  that  consulting,  hardware,
software and direct  payroll-related costs associated with the implementation of
customized internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the  software.  These costs relate to game site  application  and
infrastructure  design and  development,  as well as costs  related to providing
customer  account  management  and  building  in  e-Commerce  functionality  and
interfaces.  SOP 98-1 is effective  for financial  statements  issued for fiscal
years  beginning  after December 15, 1998. As of September 30, 2000, the Company
has capitalized  $43,342,000 of these costs  associated with the effort to build
the EA.com website and infrastructure.

North America Net Revenues

The decrease in North America net revenues for the three months ended  September
30, 2000,  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to:

o    A 38% decrease in  PlayStation  revenues due to the console  transition  to
     PlayStation 2. We released five titles in the quarter  compared to seven in
     the comparable prior year period.

o    A 78% decrease in Nintendo 64 (or N64) revenues also related to the console
     transition.  We released one title in the quarter compared to four releases
     in the comparable prior year period.

o    These decreases were partially  offset by an increase in PC revenues due to
     the strong sales of The Sims and The Sims Livin' Large.

The decrease in North  America net  revenues for the six months ended  September
30, 2000, compared to the same period last year was primarily due to:

o    A 54% decrease in  PlayStation  revenues due to the console  transition  to
     PlayStation 2. We released six titles in the six months ended September 30,
     2000 compared to ten in the comparable prior year period.

o    An 80% decrease in N64 revenues also related to the console transition.  We
     released one title in the six months ended  September  30, 2000 compared to
     four releases in the comparable prior year period.

o    These decreases were partially  offset by an increase in PC revenues due to
     the strong sales of The Sims and The Sims Livin' Large.

International Net Revenues

The decrease in international  net revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2000,  compared to the same period last year was primarily  attributable to:

o    Europe's net revenues decreased 45% primarily due to market weakness, lower
     PC sales with fewer titles  shipping in the quarter and the strong sales of
     Command & Conquer  Tiberian  Sun for the PC in the  comparable  prior  year
     period as well as weakness in the Euro currency.  In addition,  PlayStation
     revenue  decreased  50% due to fewer  titles  shipping  during the  console
     transition.

                                       21
<PAGE>

o    European AL sales  decreased due to a weaker market and fewer hit titles as
     compared to the prior year.

o    Asia Pacific's net revenues  decreased 30%,  mainly in PC revenues,  due to
     the strong sales of Command & Conquer  Tiberian Sun in the comparable prior
     year period.

o    Japan's net revenues  decreased  22% due to a 94%  decrease in  PlayStation
     revenues  attributable to significantly  reduced PlayStation market, no new
     titles released in the current quarter as well as strong sales of FIFA 1999
     in the comparable prior year period.  This was offset by the revenue on two
     PlayStation 2 titles: FIFA Soccer World Championship and Xfire.

The decrease in  international  net revenues for the six months ended  September
30, 2000, compared to the same period last year was primarily attributable to:

o    Europe's net revenues decreased 35% primarily due to market weakness, lower
     AL sales due to fewer hit titles  released  in the current  year,  lower PC
     sales with fewer  titles  shipping in the  quarter and the strong  sales of
     Command & Conquer  Tiberian  Sun for the PC in the  comparable  prior  year
     period as well as weakness in the Euro currency.  In addition,  PlayStation
     revenue  decreased  24% due to fewer  titles  shipping  during the  console
     transition period.

o    Asia Pacific's net revenues  decreased  15%,  mainly due to the decrease in
     PlayStation  revenues as there were no significant  new titles  released in
     the  current  year.  Lower AL sales also  contributed  to the  decrease  as
     compared to the prior year.

o    Japan's net revenues increased 76% compared to the prior year primarily due
     to the shipment of two PlayStation 2 titles, FIFA Soccer World Championship
     and Xfire.

Personal Computer Product Net Revenues

We  released  four PC titles in the second  quarter of the  current  fiscal year
compared  to six for the same  period  last year.  The  decrease  in sales of PC
products for the three and six months  ended  September  30, 2000 was  primarily
attributable to fewer titles and the release of a major title, Command & Conquer
Tiberian  Sun, in the second  quarter of the previous  year.  This  decrease was
offset  by strong  sales of The Sims and The Sims  Livin'  Large in the  current
year.

PlayStation Product Net Revenues

We released five PlayStation  titles in the second quarter of the current fiscal
year compared to seven for the same period last year,  including  Madden NFL. As
expected,  PlayStation sales decreased for the three months and six months ended
September  30, 2000  compared to the prior year  primarily  attributable  to the
PlayStation  2  platform  transition.  Although  our  PlayStation  products  are
playable on the  PlayStation 2 console,  we expect sales of current  PlayStation
products to continue to decline in fiscal 2001.

Under the terms of a licensing  agreement  with Sony Computer  Entertainment  of
America in July 1994 (the "Sony  Agreement"),  as amended,  we are authorized to
develop  and  distribute   CD-based  software   products   compatible  with  the
PlayStation.   Pursuant  to  the  Sony  Agreement,  we  engage  Sony  to  supply
PlayStation CDs for distribution by us. Accordingly,  we have limited ability to
control our supply of PlayStation  CD products or the timing of their  delivery.
See Risk  Factors  - "Our  platform  licensors  are our  chief  competitors  and
frequently control the manufacturing of our video game products", below.

Online Net Revenues

The increase in online revenues for the three and six months ended September 30,
2000 as  compared  to the three and six  months  ended  September  30,  1999 was
attributable to the following:

o    We  generated  over  $1,400,000  in  subscription  revenues  for Kesmai and
     Worldplay  products in the current  quarter and over $3,800,000 for the six
     months ended  September  30, 2000.  These  products were part of the Kesmai
     acquisition  which  occurred in the fourth

                                       23
<PAGE>

     quarter of fiscal 2000. It is anticipated  that the  subscription  revenues
     associated with these services will be eliminated as these products will be
     shut-down or converted into ad revenue-based offerings in future quarters.

o    The average number of paying  customers for Ultima Online increased to over
     190,000 for the three months ended  September  30, 2000 as compared to over
     120,000  for the same  period  last year and was over  194,000  for the six
     months  ended  September  30, 2000 as compared to over 116,000 for the same
     period last year. This increase was due to continued strong sales of Ultima
     Online, the addition of new events and parties within the Ultima worlds and
     the release of Ultima  Renaissance in April 2000. Ultima  Renaissance added
     features including new houses and land mass.

o    We established servers for Ultima Online in Korea in September 1999, Taiwan
     in  November  1999 and  Australia  in January  2000 which  resulted  in new
     customers for the three months and six months ended  September 30, 2000, as
     compared to the same periods last year.

PlayStation 2 Product Net Revenues

We released our first two PlayStation 2 titles,  FIFA Soccer World  Championship
and Xfire, in Japan during the first half of fiscal 2001.

N64 Product Net Revenues

We released one N64 title in the second  quarter of fiscal 2001 compared to four
titles during the same period last year.  The expected  decrease in N64 revenues
for the three months and six months ended  September  30, 2000,  compared to the
same period last year was primarily due to fewer releases.  The decrease is also
due to the weaker market for Nintendo 64 products in the current year. We expect
revenues for N64 products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal 2001.

Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64
cartridges  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have  little  ability to
control our supply of N64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery. A shortage
of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to
obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.

In connection  with our purchases of N64  cartridges for  distribution  in North
America,  Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to
Nintendo's  acceptance  of  purchase  orders  from  us for  purchases  of  these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk. See Risk Factors - "Our platform licensors are our
chief  competitors and frequently  control the  manufacturing  of our video game
products", below.

License, OEM and Other Revenues

The  increase in license,  OEM and other  revenues  for the three and six months
ended September 30, 2000 was primarily a result of higher  licensing  revenue in
Europe due to revenue generated from an exclusive distribution agreement.

Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues

The decrease in Affiliated Label net revenues for the three and six months ended
September  30, 2000  compared to the same periods last year was primarily due to
the strong sales of Final

                                       24
<PAGE>

Fantasy VIII in the prior year, the acquisition of Accolade,  formerly an AL, by
a third  party in the  first  quarter  of the prior  year,  our  acquisition  of
DreamWorks Interactive,  formerly an AL, in the fourth quarter of the prior year
and fewer hit AL product releases.

Operations by Segment

As a result of the  approval  of the  Tracking  Stock  proposal  (see Note 3) to
authorize  issuance of a new series of common stock designated as Class B common
stock,  intended  to reflect the  performance  of EA.com,  management  considers
EA.com  to  be  a  separate  reportable  segment.   Accordingly,   prior  period
information has been restated to disclose this separate  segment.  We operate in
two principal business segments globally:

o    Electronic Arts core ("EA Core") business segment: creation,  marketing and
     distribution of entertainment software.

o    EA.com  business   segment:   creation,   marketing  and   distribution  of
     entertainment  software  which  can be played or sold  online  and  ongoing
     management of subscriptions of online games.

EA.com, a division of Electronic Arts Inc.,  represents  Electronic Arts' online
and e-Commerce  businesses.  EA.com's  business includes  subscription  revenues
collected for Internet game play on our  websites,  sales of packaged  goods for
Internet-only based games and sales of Electronic Arts games sold through EA.com
websites.  The statement of operations  includes all revenues and costs directly
attributable to EA.com,  including charges for shared facilities,  functions and
services  used by EA.com and  provided by  Electronic  Arts.  Certain  costs and
expenses  have been  allocated  based on  management's  estimates of the cost of
services provided to EA.com by Electronic Arts.

The following table presents  pro-forma  results of operations  allocating taxes
between EA Core and EA.com.  Consolidated  taxes have been  allocated to EA Core
and EA.com on a pro rata basis based on the  consolidated  effective  tax rates,
thereby  giving  EA.com the tax  benefit of its losses  which is utilized by the
consolidated  group.  Such tax benefit  could not be  recognized  by EA.com on a
stand-alone basis. The sum of tax expense and tax benefit for EA Core and EA.com
is the same as  consolidated  tax expense  and tax  benefit.  This  presentation
represents how management analyzes each segment of the business (in thousands):

</TABLE>

Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues increased
for the three months and six months  ended  September  30, 2000  compared to the
same period last year primarily due to:

o    A  decrease  in the  average  margins  on  PlayStation  products  due to an
     increase,  as a percent of revenue,  in lower margin catalogue  products as
     compared to the prior year.

o    A decrease in the average  margins on PC products due to an increase,  as a
     percent of revenue,  in lower margin catalogue  products as compared to the
     prior year. In addition,  prior year included higher sales of higher margin
     internally  developed  titles such as Command & Conquer  Tiberian  Sun, Sim
     City 3000, and Dungeon Keeper 2.

o    Offset by a decrease in sales of lower margin N64 titles.

Marketing  and Sales.  Marketing  and sales  expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2000 decreased in absolute dollars by 17% and decreased 8% for the
six  months  ended  September  30,  2000,  primarily  attributed  to:

o    Lower  television,  print and Internet  advertising  due to fewer number of
     releases in the quarter compared to the same period last year. In addition,
     prior year  reflects a large  advertising  effort to support the release of
     Command & Conquer Tiberian Sun.

o    Decrease  in  cooperative  advertising  associated  with lower  revenues in
     Europe and North America.

o    Offset by an  increase  in EA.com  marketing  and sales  staff  required to
     support  the future  launch of the game  site.  In future  periods,  EA.com
     intends to further increase marketing and advertising  spending in order to
     promote the game site and the Games Channel on AOL.

                                       31

General and  Administrative.  General and administrative  expenses increased for
the three  months  ended  September  30,  2000 in  absolute  dollars  by 18% and
increased 21% for the six months ended September 30, 2000,  primarily attributed
to:

o    The  expansion  of the EA.com staff and  additional  administrative-related
     costs required to support the growth of the EA.com business.  We anticipate
     a  continued  increase  in  the  absolute  dollars  spent  on  general  and
     administrative related expenses.

o    Increase in bad debt due to a write off of a receivable  as a result of the
     default of payment from a customer in Europe.

o    Increase in depreciation  expense for Europe due to the implementation of a
     new online transaction processing system.

Research and Development  (excluding Network Development and Support).  Research
and development expenses increased for the three months ended September 30, 2000
in absolute dollars by 28% and 42% for the six months  ended September 30, 2000,
primarily attributed to:

o    Increase in research and development expenses by EA.com (including expenses
     incurred  by EA core on behalf of EA.com)  due to an increase in the number
     of online projects in development and increased development staff. The type
     of  games  that  will  be in  development  will  most  likely  increase  in
     complexity  and depth.  To support this  effort,  EA.com may be required to
     increase its development and production expenses.

o    An increase in development  spending for next generation  console  products
     including development for the PlayStation 2 console.

o    The increase is also due to research and  development  expenses  related to
     the acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive,  a software development company,
     in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year.

Network Development and Support. The increase in network development and support
expenses  was  primarily  due to  increased  spending  for  the  EA.com  network
infrastructure  and the network  support  organization  in  preparation  for the
launch of the EA.com game site and the Games Channel on the AOL service. Certain
costs  associated with EA.com's  infrastructure  build have been  capitalized in
accordance  with  SOP  98-1.  EA.com  will  begin   amortizing  these  costs
commencing  with the  October  launch of these  sites.  In  addition,  resources
previously associated with developing this infrastructure will be reallocated to
maintaining these sites and building new enhancements for EA.com web properties.
As such,  the  related  costs for these  resources  will be either  expensed  or
capitalized as required by this SOP.

Amortization of Intangibles.  The amortization of intangibles  results primarily
from the acquisitions of Westwood,  Kesmai, ABC Software and other acquisitions.
Amortization of intangibles was $3,221,000 for EA Core and $1,495,000 for EA.com
for the three months ended  September 30, 2000.  Amortization of intangibles was
$6,461,000  for EA Core and  $2,909,000  for  EA.com  for the six  months  ended
September 30, 2000.  Amortization  of intangibles was $2,616,000 for EA Core for
the three months ended September 30, 1999 and $5,204,000 for EA Core for the six
months ended  September 30, 1999.  There was no  amortization of intangibles for
EA.com in the same periods of the prior year.

Interest and Other Income,  Net.  Interest and other income,  net,  increased in
absolute  dollars for the three months ended September 30, 2000 primarily due to
higher interest income in the

                                       32

<PAGE>

current  year  attributable  to  investments  in longer  term  securities,  with
maturities no greater than three years, resulting in higher interest rates.

Interest and other income, net, increased for the six months ended September 30,
2000 due to higher  interest income in the current year offset by a gain on sale
of marketable  securities  and a sale of a minority  interest in an affiliate in
the same period last year.

Income  Taxes.  Our  effective  tax rate was 31.0% for the three  months and six
months  ended  September  30,  2000 and 32% for the three  months and six months
ended  September 30, 1999.  The effective tax rate was lower than the comparable
prior  year  period  primarily  as a result of a  projected  higher  portion  of
international  income for fiscal  2001  subject to a lower  foreign  tax rate as
compared to the prior year.

Net Income  (Loss).  In absolute  dollars,  reported net loss  increased for the
three and six  months  ended  September  30,  2000  primarily  related  to lower
revenues and gross profits as well as higher costs and expenses, as a percent of
net revenues,  compared to the same period last year.  The increase was also due
to an  increase  in the number of products  in  development  and higher  network
development  and support costs in  preparation  for new online  products and our
game site and the Games Channel on the AOL service.

Excluding  goodwill  and  non-cash   compensation   charges  in  the  amount  of
$3,951,000,  net of taxes,  for the three months ended  September 30, 2000,  net
loss would have been $34,958,000.  Excluding goodwill and non-cash  compensation
charges in the amount of  $2,007,000,  net of taxes,  for the three months ended
September 30, 1999, net income would have been $20,139,000.  Excluding  goodwill
and non-cash compensation charges in the amount of $7,549,000, net of taxes, for
the six months ended  September 30, 2000, net loss would have been  $73,631,000.
Excluding goodwill and non-cash compensation charges in the amount of $3,838,00,
net of taxes for the six months ended  September 30, 1999, net income would have
been $24,296,000.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

As of  September  30, 2000,  our working  capital was  $365,196,000  compared to
$440,021,000  at  March  31,  2000.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments  decreased by approximately  $85,987,000 during the six months ended
September 30, 2000 as we used  $42,954,000 of cash in operations and $86,861,000
in capital  expenditures,  offset by  $47,434,000  provided  through the sale of
equity  securities  under our stock plans as well as  proceeds  from the sale of
property and equipment.

Reserves for bad debts and sales returns decreased from $65,067,000 at March 31,
2000 to  $56,094,000  at  September  30,  2000.  Reserves  have been charged for
returns of product and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in
prior  periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves  are  adequate  based  on
historical  experience  and  its  current  estimate  of  potential  returns  and
allowances.

Our principal  source of liquidity is $253,817,000 in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments. Management believes the existing cash, cash equivalents,
short-term investments, marketable securities and cash generated from operations
will be sufficient to meet cash and investment requirements on both a short-term
and long-term basis.

Included in the amounts above is the following for the EA.com business:

o    To date,  EA.com has been funded  solely by  Electronic  Arts.  No interest
     charge  has  been  reflected  in the  accompanying  consolidated  financial
     statements.  Excess  cash  generated  from  operations  is  transferred  to
     Electronic  Arts. We anticipate  these funding  procedures will continue in
     the near-term.  Electronic  Arts may, at its  discretion,  provide funds to
     EA.com  under a debt  arrangement,  instead of treating  such  funding as a
     capital contribution.

o    During the six months ended September 30, 2000,  EA.com used $53,417,000 of
     cash in  operations,  $57,611,000  in  capital  expenditures  for  computer
     equipment,   network   infrastructure   and  related  software   (including
     $28,281,000  of  consulting,  hardware,  software  and direct  payroll  and
     payroll-related  costs  associated  with the  implementation  of customized
     internal-use software), offset by $111,066,000 provided through the capital
     contribution from Electronic Arts.

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  reached a consensus on issue No.
00-15  ("EITF  00-15"),  "Classification  in the  Statement of Cash Flows of the
Income  Tax  Benefit  Realized  by  a  Company  upon  Employee   Exercise  of  a
Nonqualified Stock Option". The EITF concluded that income tax benefits realized
upon an employee's  exercise of a nonqualified stock option should be classified
as an operating cash flow.  Accordingly,  the Company  reclassified tax benefits
resulting from the exercise of stock options on its  Consolidated  Statements of
Cash Flows.

                                       34

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-10 ("EITF  00-10"),
"Accounting  for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs",  and concluded  that all
amounts  billed to a customer  in a sale  transaction  related to  shipping  and
handling,  if any,  represent  revenue to the vendor and,  therefore,  should be
classified  as revenue.  The  adoption of EITF 00-10 did not have a  significant
impact on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In May 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  issued No. 00-14 ("EITF  00-14"),
"Accounting  for Certain Sales  Incentives".  EITF 00-14 states that for a sales
incentive that will not result in a loss on the sale of a product or service,  a
vendor  should  recognize the cost of the incentive at the latter of the date at
which the  related  revenue is recorded  or the date at which the  incentive  is
offered. If the sales incentive will result in a loss on the sale of the product
or service,  the vendor should not recognize a liability for the sales incentive
until the related revenue is recognized.  Secondly, for certain sales incentives
that  entitle a  customer  to receive a  reduction  in the price of a product or
service  in the form of a refund  or  rebate,  the  vendor  should  recognize  a
liability for those sales  incentives based on an estimated amount of refunds or
rebates that may be claimed by customers. The Task Force also concluded that the
reduction  in or refund  of the  selling  price  resulting  from any cash  sales
incentive  should be  classified  as a  reduction  in  revenue  and if the sales
incentive  offered is a free  product or service  delivered at the time of sale,
the cost of the free product or service should be classified as an expense.  The
adoption  of EITF  00-14  did not  have a  material  impact  on its  results  of
operations, financial position or cash flows for the Company.

In March 2000, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued  Interpretation
No.  44  ("FIN  44"),  "Accounting  for  Certain  Transactions  Involving  Stock
Compensation  (an  interpretation  of APB Opinion No. 25)". FIN 44 clarifies the
application  of APB Opinion No. 25 for certain  issues:  (a) the  definition  of
employee for purposes of applying  Opinion 25, (b) the criteria for  determining
whether  a  plan  qualifies  as  a  noncompensatory  plan,  (c)  the  accounting
consequence of various  modifications  to the terms of a previously  fixed stock
option or award,  and (d) the accounting  for an exchange of stock  compensation
awards in a business combination.  Generally,  FIN 44 is effective July 1, 2000.
The  adoption  of  FIN 44  did  not  have a  material  impact  on the  Company's
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-03 ("EITF  00-03"),
"Application of AICPA SOP 97-2, "Software Revenue  Recognition," to Arrangements
That Include the Right to Use  Software  Stored on Another  Entity's  Hardware",
which  discusses  the  effect on  revenue  recognition  of a  software  vendor's
obligation to host its software that previously was licensed to a customer.  The
EITF has reached the  conclusion  that, if the customer is unable to utilize the
software on the customer's  hardware or contract with another party unrelated to
the vendor to host the  software,  then the  arrangement  with the  customer  is
outside the scope of SOP 97-2 and should be treated as a service  contract.  The
adoption of EITF 00-03 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial
position and results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-02 ("EITF  00-02"),
"Accounting for Web Site  Development  Costs".  EITF 00-02 states that all costs
relating to software used to operate a web site and relating to  development  of
initial  graphics and web page design should be accounted for using Statement of
Position ("SOP") 98-1. Under this SOP, costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage  should  be  expensed  as  incurred,  as  should  most  training  and data
conversion  costs.  External direct costs of materials and services and internal
direct  payroll-

                                       35
<PAGE>

related costs should be capitalized once certain criteria are met. EITF 00-02 is
effective for all fiscal  quarters  beginning after June 30, 2000. The Company's
accounting  policy  for  internal-use   software,   as  required  by  SOP  98-1,
incorporated the requirements of EITF 00-02.

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101("SAB 101"),  "Revenue  Recognition," which outlines
the basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance
for  presentation of revenue and for disclosure  related to revenue  recognition
policies in financial  statements  filed with the SEC. SAB 101 is effective  the
fourth  fiscal  quarter of fiscal  years  beginning  after  December 15, 1999 as
amended by SAB 101B. The Company  believes the adoption of SAB 101 will not have
a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",   as  amended  by  SFAS  137
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the
Effective  Date of FASB  Statement No. 133 - an Amendment of FASB  Statement No.
133" and SFAS 138  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments and Certain
Hedging  Activities - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" which  establishes
accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments  and hedging
activities. The terms of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 are effective as of the beginning
of the first  quarter of the fiscal  year  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The
Company  is  determining  the effect of SFAS 133,  137 and 138 on its  financial
statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained  for  Internal  Use".  SOP 98-1  requires  that  consulting,  hardware,
software and direct  payroll-related costs associated with the implementation of
customized internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the  software.  These costs relate to game site  application  and
infrastructure  design and  development,  as well as costs  related to providing
customer  account  management  and  building  in  e-Commerce  functionality  and
interfaces.  SOP 98-1 is effective  for financial  statements  issued for fiscal
years  beginning  after December 15, 1998. As of September 30, 2000, the Company
has capitalized  $43,342,000 of these costs  associated with the effort to build
the EA.com website and infrastructure.

RISK Factors

Electronic Arts' business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties  which may
affect our  future  financial  performance.  Some of those  important  risks and
uncertainties  which  may  cause  our  operating  results  to vary or which  may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows:

                   Risk Factors Relating to Our Core Business

Platform  Transitions Such as the One Now Occurring Typically Depress the Market
for Video Game Software Until New Platforms Achieve a Wide Market Acceptance

When new video game  platforms  are  announced  or  introduced  into the market,
consumers  typically reduce their purchases of video games for current platforms
in anticipation of new platforms being available.  During that period,  sales of
our video  game  products  can be  expected  to slow or even  decline  until new
platforms have achieved a wide market and consumer acceptance.  We are currently
in such a  transition.  Sony has shipped its  PlayStation 2 product in Japan and
North  America  and  expects  to ship the  PlayStation  2  console  in Europe in
November  2000.  For the  December  quarter and the  current  fiscal  year,  the
manufacturing  shortages  announced by Sony of the  PlayStation 2 units in North
America and Europe pose serious uncertainty. In addition, Nintendo and Microsoft
have announced that their new console  systems will be released in calendar year
2001. Current sales of our products for the existing PlayStation and Nintendo 64
platforms have been adversely  affected.  We expect this trend to continue until
one or more of these new consoles achieve a wide installed base of consumers.

New  Video  Game  Platforms  Create  Additional  Technical  and  Business  Model
Uncertainties

     Large  portions of our  revenues  are derived from the sale of products for
play on  proprietary  video game  platforms  such as the Sony  PlayStation.  The
success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video
game  hardware  systems and the life span of older  hardware  platforms  and our
ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful.

     Sometimes we will spend  development  and  marketing  resources on products
designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved  large  installed
bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may
have shorter life cycles than we expected.  Conversely, if we do not develop for
a  platform  that  achieves   significant  market  acceptance,   or  discontinue
development  for a platform  that has a longer  life cycle  than  expected,  our
revenue growth may be adversely affected.

     For example, the Sega Dreamcast console launched in Japan in early 1999 and
in the United States in September of 1999. We have no products under development
for this  platform.  Should this platform  achieve wide market  acceptance,  our
revenue growth may be adversely  affected.  Similarly,  we released a variety of
products for the new Sony platform,  the PlayStation 2. Should that platform not
achieve wide  acceptance  by  consumers,  we will have spent a  disproportionate
amount of our resources for this platform.  Additionally, we have not negotiated
publishing  agreements  with Sony,  Sega or Nintendo  for their next  generation
platforms,  or with Microsoft for their new console  system,  and we do not know
whether the terms of those agreements will be favorable.

Product  Development  Schedules Are Frequently  Unreliable  and Make  Predicting
Quarterly Results Difficult

     Product development schedules,  particularly for new hardware platforms and
high-end multimedia personal computers, or PCs, are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes,  use of new

                                       37
<PAGE>

development  tools for new  platforms  and the  learning  process,  research and
experimentation  associated with development for new technologies.  For example,
Tiberian  Sun,  which was  expected  to ship in  fiscal  1999 at the time of our
acquisition  of Westwood  Studios,  was not released until the second quarter of
fiscal  2000 due to  development  delays.  Additionally,  development  risks for
CD-ROM  products  can cause  particular  difficulties  in  predicting  quarterly
results because brief  manufacturing  lead times allow  finalizing  products and
projected  release  dates late in a  quarter.  Our  revenues  and  earnings  are
dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules,  and our failure
to meet those  schedules  could result in revenues and earnings which fall short
of analysts' expectations for any individual quarter and the fiscal year.

Our Business Is Both Seasonal and Cyclical

     Our  business  is highly  seasonal  with a  significant  percentage  of our
revenues  occurring in the December quarter.  In our 2001 fiscal year, we expect
these seasonal trends to be magnified by general industry factors, including the
current platform transition and the concentration of our product releases in the
second  half  of  fiscal  2001.  In  addition,   we  are  continuing  to  invest
significantly in our online  operation,  EA.com.  Our business is also cyclical;
video game  platforms have  historically  had a life cycle of four to six years,
and decline as more  advanced  platforms are being  introduced.  As one group of
platforms  is  reaching  the end of its cycle and new  platforms  are  emerging,
buying  patterns may change.  Purchases of products for older platforms may slow
at a  faster  rate  than  sales of new  platforms.  We are  currently  in such a
platform transition. Sega introduced its latest platform in the United States in
September  1999,  and Sony has  shipped its  PlayStation  2 console in Japan and
North  America  and  expects  to ship its  PlayStation  2  product  in Europe in
November 2000. Nintendo and Microsoft have also announced that their new console
systems will be released in calendar  year 2001.  Sales of our current  products
for the  current  Nintendo  and  Sony  platforms  have  already  been  adversely
affected,  and we expect this trend to continue  until one or more new platforms
achieves a wide installed base of consumers.

The Impact of e-Commerce and Online Games on Our Business Is Not Known

     While we do not currently derive significant  revenues from online sales of
our packaged  products,  we believe that such form of distribution will become a
more significant factor in our business in the future. E-commerce is becoming an
increasingly  popular method for conducting  business with  consumers.  How that
form of distribution will affect the more traditional  retail  distribution,  at
which we have historically had success, and over what time period, is uncertain.
In addition, we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and
become a significant factor in the interactive games business  generally.  We do
not know  how that  increase  generally,  or the  emerging  business  of  EA.com
specifically, will affect the sales of packaged goods.

Our  Business,  Our  Products,  and Our  Distribution  Are Subject to Increasing
Regulation in Key Territories

     Legislation is increasingly  introduced which may affect the content of our
products and their distribution. For example, privacy rules in the United States
and Europe impose  various  restrictions  on our web sites.  Those rules vary by
territory while of course the Internet  recognizes no  geographical  boundaries.
Other countries such as Germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted
over the Internet  that are stricter  than current  United  States laws.  In the
United  States,  in response  to recent  events,  the federal and several  state
governments are considering content  restrictions on products such as those made
by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products.  Any one or more
of these factors could harm our business.

                                       38
<PAGE>

Our Platform  Licensors Are Our Chief  Competitors  and  Frequently  Control the
Manufacturing of Our Video Game Products

     Our  agreements  with  hardware   licensors,   which  are  also  our  chief
competitors,  typically  give  significant  control  to the  licensor  over  the
approval  and  manufacturing  of our  products.  This  fact  could,  in  certain
circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products  approved,  manufactured and
shipped to customers.  In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing
process by the platform  licensors  increases both our manufacturing  lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve  independently.  For  example,  in
prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining  approvals for and manufacturing
of  PlayStation  products which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The
potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products
continues with our platform licensors.  Such occurrences would harm our business
and adversely affect our financial performance.

Proliferation and Assertion of Patents Poses Serious Risks to our Business

     Many  patents  have  been  issued  that  may  apply  to  widely  used  game
technologies.  Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against Internet  implementations  of existing games.  Several such patents have
been  asserted  against us. For  example,  we currently  have a lawsuit  pending
regarding our publication of games that can be played both alone and with others
over the Internet in which the patent  holder has moved to enjoin the sale of EA
personal computer products that can be played alone and over the Internet.  Such
claims can harm our business.  We will incur substantial  expenses in evaluating
and defending  against such claims,  regardless of the merits of the claims.  In
the event that there is a  determination  that we have  infringed  a third party
patent,  we could incur  significant  monetary  liability and be prevented  from
using the rights in the future.

                  Risk Factors Relating to Our Online Business

Because of EA.com's Limited Operating History,  It Will Be Difficult To Evaluate
its Business and Prospects

     EA.com's  business is still in the  developing  stages,  so evaluating  its
business and prospects  will be more difficult than would be the case for a more
mature business.  We will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced
in  launching  a new  business,  and we may  not  achieve  our  goals  or may be
compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the  business.  These
uncertainties as to the future operations of EA.com will increase the difficulty
we face in completing  and pursuing the essential  plans for the  development of
the  business  and will also make it more  difficult  for our  stockholders  and
securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business.

EA.com Has a History of Losses and Expects To  Continue To Incur  Losses and May
Never Achieve Profitability

     EA.com has  incurred  substantial  losses to date,  including  the  current
fiscal  year.  We expect  EA.com to continue to incur  losses as it develops its
business.  EA.com will be required to maintain the significant support,  service
and product  enhancement  demands of online users, and we cannot be certain that
EA.com will produce  sufficient  revenues  from its  operations to support these
costs.  Even if profitability is achieved,  EA.com may not be able to sustain it
over a period of time.

                                       39
<PAGE>

Our Agreements  with America Online May Not Prove  Successful to the Development
of EA.com's Business

     We have  announced a series of agreements  with America  Online ("AOL") for
the offering of our games through AOL for online play. These agreements  require
that we make  substantial  guaranteed  payments  to AOL and that we  commit  our
resources  to the pursuit of the online game  opportunity.  We cannot be assured
that the substantial  costs associated with the AOL agreements will be justified
by the revenues  generated  from that  relationship.  In addition,  restrictions
included  in the AOL  agreements  limiting  other  channels  we may  develop for
offering online games may limit our ability to diversify our online distribution
strategies.   The success for us of the AOL agreements  will also be a result of
AOL's  performance  under the agreements,  a factor over which we will have very
little control.

We Have Very Limited Experience with Online Games and May Not Be Able To Operate
This Business Effectively

     Offering  games solely for online play is a substantial  departure from our
traditional business of selling packaged software games. We anticipate employing
various  pricing  models,  including  subscription  fees, "pay to play fees" and
advertising.  We have very little  experience  with  developing  optimal pricing
strategies  for online games and no  experience  in "pay to play"  pricing or in
securing   advertising   revenue  for  online   services.   Similarly,   we  are
inexperienced  in  predicting  usage  patterns  for our  games.  Because  of our
inexperience in this area, we may not be effective in achieving success that may
otherwise be attainable from offering our games online.

Online Games Have Risks That Are Not Associated with Our Traditional Business

     Online  games,   particularly  multiplayer  games,  pose  risks  to  player
enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales. Players frequently
would not be  acquainted  with other  players,  which may  adversely  affect the
playing  experience.  Social issues raised by a player's  conduct may impact the
experience  for other players.  We have not  determined  whether or how we might
monitor or proctor  player  behavior to mitigate  behavior that impairs the game
experience.  In addition,  there are substantial  technical challenges to be met
both in the  introduction  of our games online and in  maintaining  an effective
game  playing  environment  over  time.  If  these  risks  are not  successfully
controlled and technical challenges resolved,  potential customers for our games
may be unwilling to play in  sufficient  volume to allow us to attain or sustain
profitability.

We May Not Be Able To Obtain the Required Licenses To Offer Our Games Online

     If we are unable to reach terms with certain  licensors  for our games,  we
will  not be able to  offer  certain  of our  games  for  online  play.  Many of
Electronic Arts' most popular games feature  characters,  trademarks,  people or
concepts for which we have licenses from third  parties.  As an example,  our EA
SPORTS products  typically  contain content  licensed from a sports and players'
association. In certain instances, the terms of these licenses will not allow us
to offer the games for online play without negotiating an additional license. We
cannot be certain  that the  licensors  will be amenable to a license for online
games  involving  their  content or,  even if they are,  that we will be able to
reach  terms  with  them for such use.  We may be forced to agree to terms  that
ultimately materially impair the economic value to us of the online game market.

Proliferation  and  Assertion of Patents  Poses Serious Risks to the Business of
EA.com

     Many  patents  have been  issued  that may apply to  widely  used  Internet
technologies.  Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against Internet  implementations  of older  technologies.  Several such patents
have been asserted against us. For example,  we currently have a lawsuit pending
regarding our publication of games that can be played both alone and with others
over
                                       40
<PAGE>

the  Internet  in which the  patent  holder  has moved to enjoin  the sale of EA
personal computer products that can be played alone and over the Internet.  Such
claims can harm our business.  We will incur substantial  expenses in evaluating
and defending  against such claims,  regardless of the merits of the claims.  In
the event that there is a  determination  that we have  infringed  a third party
patent,  we could incur  significant  monetary  liability and be prevented  from
using the rights in the future.

Development of EA.com's Business Will Require Significant Capital, and We Cannot
Be Assured That It Will Be Available

     EA.com will not be successful  if it does not receive the very  substantial
financing  that will be required  to launch its  business.  Electronic  Arts has
agreed to provide a limited  amount of funding  to  EA.com,  but this  financing
alone will not be  sufficient  for the  development  of EA.com's  business.  Any
additional funding that is obtained from EA may either be treated as a revolving
credit  advance  or  would  increase  EA's  retained   interest  in  EA.com  and
correspondingly  decrease the interest of the holders of  outstanding  shares of
Class B common stock. The attraction of additional  equity or debt financing for
EA.com  from third  parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms
that result in significant  dilution to Class A and Class B common  stockholders
or interest or other costs and debt-related restrictions on the operation of the
business.

If Use of the Internet  Does Not  Continue To Develop and  Reliably  Support the
Demands Placed on It by Electronic Commerce, EA.com's Business Will Be Harmed

     EA.com's success depends upon growth in the use of the Internet as a medium
for playing  games.  Although the Internet is  experiencing  rapid growth in the
number  of  users,  this  growth is a recent  phenomenon  and may not  continue.
Furthermore,  despite  this  growth  in  usage,  the  use  of the  Internet  for
sophisticated games like ours is relatively new. Our business would be seriously
harmed if:

     o  use of the  Internet  does not  continue to increase or  increases  more
        slowly than expected,

     o  the infrastructure for the Internet does not effectively  support online
        game play,

     o  concerns over the secure  transmission of confidential  information over
        public  networks  inhibit  the  growth  of the  Internet  as a means  of
        conducting commercial transactions, or

     o  government  regulations  regarding  Internet  content,  privacy or other
        conditions impede the effectiveness of the Internet to users.

Capacity  Restraints  May  Restrict  the Use of the Internet as a Forum for Game
Play, Resulting in Decreased Demand for Our Products

     The Internet  infrastructure  may not be able to support the demands placed
on it by increased  usage or the limited  capacity of networks to transmit large
amounts of data.  Other risks  associated  with  commercial  use of the Internet
could slow its growth, including:

     o  outages and other delays  resulting from the  inadequate  reliability of
        the network infrastructure,

     o  slow development of enabling  technologies and  complementary  products,
        and

     o  limited availability of cost-effective, high speed access.

     Delays  in the  development  or  adoption  of new  equipment  standards  or
protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity, or increased
governmental  regulation,  would cause the

                                       41
<PAGE>

Internet to fail to gain,  or lose,  viability  as a means of game  playing.  If
these or any other  factors  cause use of the  Internet  for commerce to slow or
decline, the Internet may not prove viable as a commercial marketplace. This, in
turn, would result in decreased demand for EA.com's products and services.

To Become and Remain Competitive, EA.com Must Continually Develop and Expand New
Content. This Is Inherently Risky and Expensive.

     EA.com's  success  depends on our ability to develop  products and services
for the initial launch of the EA.com site and our ability to continually  expand
the  content on that site.  Our  agreement  with AOL  requires us to develop new
games under our  relationship  with AOL. We cannot assure you that products will
be  developed  on  time,  in a cost  effective  manner,  or  that  they  will be
successful.

We May Not Be Able To Respond to Rapid Technological Change

     The market for Internet  products and  services is  characterized  by rapid
technological  change and evolving  industry  standards.  Both in completing the
design and implementation of our network infrastructure and thereafter,  we will
be  required to  continually  improve  performance,  features,  reliability  and
capacity of our  network  infrastructure.  We cannot  assure you that we will be
successful  in  responding  rapidly  or  in a  cost  effective  manner  to  such
developments.

Increasing  Governmental  Regulation of the Internet  Could Limit the Market for
Our Products

     As Internet commerce continues to evolve, we expect that federal, state and
foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user
privacy,  taxation of goods and services  provided over the  Internet,  pricing,
content and quality of products and services.  It is possible  that  legislation
could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability, taxation or
other  increased  costs,  any of which  could  limit the  growth  of  electronic
commerce  generally.  Legislation  could dampen the growth in Internet usage and
decrease its acceptance as a communications  and commercial  medium. If enacted,
these laws and regulations could limit the market for EA.com's products.

If We Do Not Maintain Our Relationship with Outside Consultants Such as Andersen
Consulting, Our Ability To Develop Our Online Business Will Be Impaired

     Because approximately 20% of the staff creating,  designing, and developing
the  infrastructure for EA.com's website and network interface is being provided
by  outside  consultants  such  as  Andersen  Consulting,  losing  the  business
relationship  with such  consultants  would  cause  EA.com to lose an  important
component of its website  implementation team. Given the intense competition for
qualified  technical  consultants,  EA.com  may  not be  able  to  retain  these
consultants  or, if necessary,  replace them. If it cannot do so, its ability to
develop its business will be impaired.

Our  Revenues  Have Been  Heavily  Dependent  on a Single  Product  and Would Be
Adversely Affected if That Product's Popularity Were To Decline

     In the near term,  EA.com's  revenues to date have  consisted  primarily of
revenues  from  sales  of our  online  product  Ultima  Online,  and we would be
adversely  affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason
and not be  replaced.  We expect the online game  market to become  increasingly
competitive,  and it is possible that other  producer's  current or future games
could cause our revenue from Ultima Online to decline.  In addition,  popularity
of Ultima Online could decline over time simply  because of consumer  preference
for new game experiences.

We Invest Very Heavily in Research and Development  and Network  Development and
Support for EA.com,  and We Cannot Be Assured That We Will Achieve Revenues That
Validate This Level of Spending

     We have  invested,  and  expect to  continue  to  invest,  very  heavily in
research and development and network development and support for our website and
online games. We will need to expand EA.com's  revenues  substantially for it to
achieve  profitability  with these levels of expenditure being required,  and we
may not be able to do so. If we cannot increase  revenues to profitable  levels,
the  value of EA.com  will be  impaired.  In order to  develop  the broad  games
offerings  that we envision  for our online  operations  it will be necessary to
engage in significant  developmental  efforts both to adapt existing EA games to
the  online  format  and to create new online  games.  Our  agreements  with AOL
require us to maintain a substantial  commitment to online game  development and
we  cannot  be  assured  that we  will  realize  acceptable  returns  from  this
investment.

Online  Product  Development   Schedules  Are  Unreliable  and  Make  Predicting
Quarterly Results Difficult

     Online product development schedules, particularly for Internet based games
are difficult to predict  because they involve  creative  processes,  use of new
development  tools,  Internet  latency  issues,  a  learning  process  to better
understand  Internet  based game  mechanics,  and research  and  experimentation
associated  with   development  for  new  online   technologies.   Additionally,
development risks for Internet based products can cause particular  difficulties
in predicting  quarterly results because of the challenges  associated with game
testing, live Beta testing,  integration into network servers and integration on
to the Games web site and may impact the release  ("go live")  dates of products
during a particular  quarter.  Our revenues and operating costs are dependent on
our  ability to meet our product  "go live"  schedules,  and our failure to meet
those   schedules   could  result  in  revenues   falling   short  of  analysts'
expectations, with no corresponding decrease in expenses, resulting in increased
operating losses for EA.com.

                              General Risk Factors

 We Face Intense Competition for Talent from Highly Valued Internet Companies

     Competition for employees in the interactive software business continues to
be intense.  Recently, the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining
key employees is from Internet companies.  The large equity positions frequently
offered to key executives  and creative  talent in such companies and the actual
or perceived  opportunity for rapid stock price  appreciation of these companies
make their compensation  packages attractive to those who are already working in
more mature companies.  This situation creates  difficulty for us to compete for
the attraction and retention of executive and key creative talent.

Because of the Intense Competition for Qualified Technical,  Creative, Marketing
and Other  Personnel,  We May Not Be Able To Attract  and  Retain the  Personnel
Necessary for our Businesses

     The market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential
to the  development  of online  businesses and management of our online and core
businesses  is  extremely  competitive,  and we may not be able to  attract  and
retain the employees we need. In addition, the rising cost of real estate in the
San Francisco Bay area - the location of our  headquarters  and largest  studio,
has  increased  dramatically,  and has made  recruiting  from  other  areas  and
relocating   employees  to  our  headquarters  more  difficult.   If  we  cannot
successfully  recruit and retain the  employees we need,  our ability to develop
and manage our businesses will be impaired.

Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations

     For both the six months ended  September 30, 2000 and the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2000  international net revenues  comprised 40% of total  consolidated
net revenues.  We expect  foreign sales to continue to account for a significant
and  growing  portion  of our  revenues.  Such sales are  subject to  unexpected
regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales
are  primarily  made in local  currencies  which may  fluctuate.  While we hedge
against foreign currency fluctuations, we cannot control translation issues such
as that currently  present with the Euro. For example,  our European revenues in
the six months ended September 30, 2000 were adversely impacted by a devaluation
of the Euro as compared to the prior year. If the current trend  continues,  the
devaluation  will have a continued  adverse effect for the year on our sales and
net income. Any of these factors may significantly harm our business.

Increased Difficulties in Forecasting Results

     During platform  transition  periods,  where the success of our products is
significantly impacted by the changing market for our products,  forecasting our
revenues and earnings is more  difficult  than in more stable or rising  product
markets. The demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than
we anticipate,  negatively impacting both revenues and earnings.  Sony announced
that it has shipped only half of the number of  PlayStation 2 units to retail in
North America at launch than it had originally  planned,  and that it expects to
ship  significantly  fewer units than planned at launch in November in Europe as
well.  Shortages  were  announced as being caused by shortages of components for
manufacturing.  Depending  on the  number  and  the  timing  of  units  actually
available  for the December  2000 holidays and the quarter ended March 31, 2001,
these shortages will adversely impact our sales of PlayStation 2 products in the
same periods.

We cannot predict the impact of recent actions and comments by the SEC and FASB

     Recent  actions and comments  from the SEC have focused on the integrity of
financial  reporting.  In  addition,  the FASB and other  regulatory  accounting
agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting  standards,
some of which represent a significant  change from current  industry  practices.
For example, In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,
"Revenue Recognition in Financial  Statements." SAB 101 provides guidance on the
recognition,  presentation, and disclosure of revenue in financial statements of
all public  registrants.  In  response  to numerous  requests  for  interpretive
guidance of SAB 101, the effective  date of the standard has been delayed twice.
SAB 101 became  effective  during the first quarter of fiscal 2001.  SAB 101 did
not have a  material  effect  on the  underlying  strength  or  weakness  of our
consolidated  business operations as measured by the dollar value of our product
shipments and cash flows.

Fluctuations in Stock Price

      Due to analysts'  expectations of continued growth and other factors,  any
shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant  adverse effect on
the trading  price of our common stock in any given  period.  As a result of the
factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future,
the market price of our common stock  historically  has been, and we expect will
continue to be subject to significant  fluctuations over a short period of time.
These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts'
earnings estimates,  or to factors affecting the computer,  software,  Internet,
entertainment,  media or  electronics  businesses or the  securities  markets in
general.

                                       44

<PAGE>

For example, during fiscal year ended March 31, 2000, the price per share of our
common  stock  ranged from $22.82 to $60.47 and $26.59 to $54.47  during the six
months ended September 30, 2000.

Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Item 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk
- -----------
We are  exposed  to  various  market  risks,  including  the  changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates and interest  rates.  Market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and short-term  investments are subject to
market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to
interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies thereby limiting our risk. Gains and
losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.  At
September 30, 2000, we had foreign  exchange  contracts,  all with maturities of
less than six months to purchase and sell approximately  $206,572,000 in foreign
currencies, primarily British Pounds, European Currency Units ("Euro"), Canadian
Dollars, Japanese Yen and other currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate. The counter parties to these contracts are substantial and
creditworthy   multinational  commercial  banks.  The  risks  of  counter  party
nonperformance  associated  with  these  contracts  are  not  considered  to  be
material.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks,  there
can be no assurances  that our hedging  activities  will  adequately  protect us
against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts at September  30, 2000.  The  information  is provided in U.S.  dollar
equivalents  and presents the notional  amount  (forward  amount),  the weighted

</TABLE>

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are  typically  able to hold our  investments  to maturity.  At September 30,
2000, our cash equivalents,  short-term and long-term  investments included debt
securities of $178,077,000.  Notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate
risks,  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately  protected against
the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

of our investment portfolio at September 30, 2000:
