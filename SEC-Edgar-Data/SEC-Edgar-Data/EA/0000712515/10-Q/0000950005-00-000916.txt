                      ELECTRONIC ARTS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Basis of Presentation

The condensed  consolidated  financial  statements are unaudited and reflect all
adjustments  (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) that, in the opinion
of  management,  are  necessary for a fair  presentation  of the results for the
interim period. The results of operations for the current interim period are not
necessarily  indicative  of results to be expected  for the current  year or any
other period.  Certain  amounts have been  reclassified to conform to the fiscal
2001 presentation.

These condensed  consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the  consolidated  financial  statements and notes thereto  included in the
Electronic Arts Inc. (the  "Company")  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended March 31, 2000 as filed with the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
("Commission") on June 29, 2000.

Note 2. Fiscal Year and Fiscal Quarter

The  Company's  fiscal year is reported on a 52/53-week  period that ends on the
Saturday  nearest to March 31 in each year. The results of operations for fiscal
2001 will  contain 53 weeks.  Accordingly,  the  results of  operations  for the
fiscal  quarter  ended June 30, 2000 and the fiscal  quarter ended June 30, 1999
contain 14 weeks and 13 weeks, respectively.  Since the results of an additional
week are not material,  and for clarity of presentation,  all fiscal periods are
treated as ending on a calendar month.

Note 3. Approval of the Tracking Stock Proposal

On March 22, 2000, the  shareholders  of Electronic Arts voted on and approved a
proposal  (the  "Tracking  Stock  Proposal")  to authorize the issuance of a new
series of  common  stock to be  designated  as Class B common  stock  ("Tracking
Stock"),  intended to reflect the  performance  of  Electronic  Arts' online and
e-Commerce  division  ("EA.com").  As a result of the  approval of the  Tracking
Stock Proposal, Electronic Arts' existing common stock has been re-classified as
Class A  common  stock  ("Class  A  Stock")  and that  stock  will  reflect  the
performance of Electronic Arts' other businesses ("EA Core").

Note 4. Prepaid Royalties

Prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments for manufacturing  royalties,
original equipment  manufacturer (OEM) fees and license fees paid to celebrities
and professional sports organizations for use of their trade name. Also included
in prepaid  royalties are prepayments  made to independent  software  developers
under  development  arrangements  that have  alternative  future  uses.  Prepaid
royalties  are  expensed at the  contractual  royalty rate as cost of goods sold
based on actual net product sales.  Management  evaluates the future realization
of prepaid royalties quarterly and charges to income any amounts that management
deems  unlikely to be realized  through  product  sales.  Royalty  advances  are
classified as current and  non-current  assets based upon  estimated net product
sales for the following year. The current portion of prepaid royalties, included
in other current assets, was $51,794,000 and $54,970,000

Note 7. Segment Information

In 1999,  the Company  adopted SFAS No. 131,  "Disclosures  about Segments of an
Enterprise and Related  Information",  which supersedes SFAS No. 14,  "Financial
Reporting  for  Segments  of a Business  Enterprise".  SFAS No. 131  establishes
standards for the reporting by public business  enterprises of information about
product lines, geographic areas and major customers.  The method for determining
what  information  to report is based on the way that  management  organizes the
operating  segments  within the Company  for making  operational  decisions  and
assessments of financial  performance.  The Company's chief  operating  decision
maker is considered to be the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The CEO
reviews financial  information  presented on a consolidated basis accompanied by
disaggregated  information  about  revenues by geographic  region and by product
lines for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions  and  assessing  financial
performance.

As a result of the approval of the Tracking Stock proposal to authorize issuance
of a new series of common stock designated as Class B common stock,  intended to
reflect the performance of EA.com,  management considers EA.com to be a separate
reportable segment. Accordingly,

The currency  translation  adjustments are not adjusted for income taxes as they
relate to indefinite investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Note 9. Earnings Per Share

The following  summarizes the  computations  of Basic Earnings Per Share ("EPS")
and  Diluted  EPS.  Basic  EPS  is  computed  as  net  earnings  divided  by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  dilution  that could occur from common  shares  issuable
through stock-based compensation plans including stock options, restricted stock
awards,  warrants and other  convertible  securities  using the  treasury  stock
method.

Net income (loss) per share was calculated on a consolidated basis until Class A
common  stock and Class B common  stock were created as a result of the approval
of the Tracking Stock  Proposal,  see Note 3.  Subsequent to the approval of the
Tracking Stock  Proposal,  net income (loss) per share is computed  individually
for Class A common stock and Class B common stock.

</TABLE>

Due to the net loss reported for the three months ended June 30, 2000 for the EA
Core segment, stock options have been excluded from the Diluted EPS calculation.
Had net income been reported,  dilutive  potential common shares would have been
67,389,000 for Class A common stock for the three months ended June 30, 2000.

The Diluted EPS calculation for Class A common stock,  presented above, includes
the potential  dilution  from the  conversion of Class B common stock to Class A
common  stock in the event that the initial  public  offering for Class B common
stock does not occur. Net loss used for the calculation of Diluted EPS for Class
A common  stock is  $(42,271,000).  This net loss  includes  the  remaining  15%
interest  in EA.com,  which is  directly  attributable  to  outstanding  Class B
shares,  which would be included in the Class A common stock EPS  calculation in
the event that the initial  public  offering  for Class B common  stock does not
occur.

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
for the three  months  ended June 30, 2000 were  options to  purchase  1,092,000
shares of Class A common stock, as the options'  exercise price was greater than
the average market price of the common  shares.  The  weighted-average  exercise
price of these respective options was $79.18.

Excluded from the above computation of  weighted-average  shares for diluted EPS
for the three months ended June 30, 1999 were options to purchase 194,000 shares
of common  stock as the  options'  exercise  price was greater  than the average
market price of the common shares. The weighted-average  exercise price of these
respective options was $52.81.

Note 10. New Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  reached a consensus on issue No.
00-15  ("EITF  00-15"),  "Classification  in the  Statement of Cash Flows of the
Income  Tax  Benefit  Realized  by  a  Company  upon  Employee   Exercise  of  a
Nonqualified Stock Option". The EITF concluded that income tax benefits realized
upon an employee's  exercise of a nonqualified stock option should be classified
as an operating cash flow.  Accordingly,  the Company  reclassified tax benefits
resulting from the exercise of stock options on its  Consolidated  Statements of
Cash Flows.

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-10 ("EITF  00-10"),
"Accounting  for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs",  and concluded  that all
amounts  billed to a customer  in a sale  transaction  related to  shipping  and
handling,  if any,  represent  revenue to the vendor and,  therefore,  should be
classified  as  revenue.  EITF 00-10 is  effective  no later  than the  required
implementation  date for SAB 101. The Company does not expect EITF 00-10 to have
a significant  impact on the results of operations,  financial  position or cash
flows on EITF 00-10's effective date.

In May 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  issued No. 00-14 ("EITF  00-14"),
"Accounting  for Certain Sales  Incentives".  EITF 00-14 states that for a sales
incentive that will not result in a loss on the sale of a product or service,  a
vendor  should  recognize the cost of the incentive at the latter of the date at
which the  related  revenue is recorded  or the date at which the  incentive  is
offered. If the sales incentive will result in a loss on the sale of the product
or service,  the vendor should not recognize a liability for the sales incentive
until the related revenue is recognized.  Secondly, for certain sales incentives
that  entitle a  customer  to receive a  reduction  in the price of a product or
service  in the form of a refund  or  rebate,  the  vendor  should  recognize  a
liability for those sales  incentives based on an estimated amount of refunds or
rebates that may be claimed by customers. The Task Force also concluded that the
reduction  in or refund  of the  selling  price  resulting  from any cash  sales
incentive  should be  classified  as a  reduction  in  revenue  and if the sales
incentive  offered is a free  product or service  delivered at the time of sale,
the cost of the free product or service  should be classifed as an expense.  The
Company  does not expect EITF 00-14 to have a material  impact on its results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-03 ("EITF  00-03"),
"Application of AICPA SOP 97-2, "Software Revenue  Recognition," to Arrangements
That Include the Right to Use  Software  Stored on Another  Entity's  Hardware",
which  discusses  the  effect on  revenue  recognition  of a  software  vendor's
obligation to host its software that previously was licensed to a customer.  The
EITF has reached the  conclusion  that, if the customer is unable to utilize the
software on the customer's  hardware or contract with another party unrelated to
the vendor to host the  software,  then the  arrangement  with the  customer  is
outside the scope of SOP 97-2 and should be treated as a service  contract.  The
adoption of EITF 00-03 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial
position and results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-02 ("EITF  00-02"),
"Accounting for Web Site  Development  Costs".  EITF 00-02 states that all costs
relating to software used to operate a web site and relating to  development  of
initial  graphics and web page design should be accounted for using Statement of
Position ("SOP") 98-1. Under this SOP, costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage  should  be  expensed  as  incurred,  as  should  most  training  and data
conversion  costs.  External direct costs of materials and services and internal
direct  payroll-related  costs should be capitalized  once certain  criteria are
met. EITF 00-02 is effective for all fiscal  quarters  beginning  after June 30,
2000. The Company's accounting policy for internal-use  software, as required by
SOP 98-1, incorporated the requirements of EITF 00-02.

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101("SAB 101"),  "Revenue  Recognition," which outlines
the basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance
for  presentation of revenue and for disclosure  related to revenue  recognition
policies in financial  statements  filed with the SEC. SAB 101 is effective  the
fourth  fiscal  quarter of fiscal  years  beginning  after  December 15, 1999 as
amended by SAB 101B. The Company  believes the adoption of SAB 101 will not have
a material impact on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",   as  amended  by  SFAS  137
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the
Effective  Date of FASB  Statement No. 133 - an Amendment of FASB  Statement No.
133" and SFAS 138  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments and Certain
Hedging  Activities - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" which  establishes
accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments  and hedging
activities. The terms of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 are effective as of the beginning
of the first  quarter of the fiscal  year  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The
Company  is  determining  the effect of SFAS 133,  137 and 138 on its  financial
statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained  for  Internal  Use".  SOP 98-1  requires  that  consulting,  hardware,
software and direct  payroll-related costs associated with the implementation of
customized internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the  software.  These costs relate to game site  application  and
infrastructure  design and  development,  as well as costs  related to providing
customer  account  management  and  building  in  e-Commerce  functionality  and
interfaces.  SOP 98-1 is effective  for financial  statements  issued for fiscal
years  beginning  after  December 15, 1998. As of June 30, 2000, the Company has
capitalized  $30,303,000 of these costs  associated with the effort to build the
EA.com website and infrastructure.

"Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations"  contains  forward-looking  statements about circumstances that have
not yet occurred. All statements, trend analysis and other information contained
below relating to markets,  our products and trends in revenue, as well as other
statements  including  words such as  "anticipate",  "believe"  or "expect"  and
statements   in  the  future  tense  are   forward-looking   statements.   These
forward-looking statements are subject to business and economic risks and actual
events or our actual future results could differ materially from those set forth
in the forward-looking  statements due to such risks and uncertainties.  We will
not necessarily update information if any forward-looking  statement later turns
out to be inaccurate. Risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results
and  performance  include,  but are not limited to,  those  discussed  under the
heading "Risk  Factors" below at pages 28 to 35, as well as in our Annual Report
on Form  10-K for the  fiscal  year  ended  March  31,  2000 as  filed  with the
Securities and Exchange  Commission on June 29, 2000 and other  documents  filed
with the Commission.

We derive revenues  primarily from shipments of  entertainment  software,  which
includes EA Studio  products for dedicated  entertainment  systems (that we call
video game systems or consoles such as  PlayStation,  PlayStation 2 and Nintendo
64), EA Studio personal computer products (or PC),  Co-Publishing  products that
are  co-published  and distributed by us, and Affiliated  Label (or AL) products
that are  published  by third  parties  and  distributed  by us. We also  derive
revenues from  licensing of EA Studio  products and  Affiliated  Label  products
through  hardware  companies  (or  OEMs),  online  subscription  and  e-Commerce
revenues.

North America Net Revenues

The  decrease in North  America net revenues for the three months ended June 30,
2000 compared to the same period last year was primarily attributable to:

o      Expected declines in sales of PlayStation and Nintendo 64 ("N64") titles.
       PlayStation  net  revenues  decreased  84% and  Nintendo 64 net  revenues
       decreased  93% due to no new titles  shipping in the current  quarter for
       both platforms as well as a general market weakness.
o      These  decreases were partially  offset by an 81% increase in AL revenues
       primarily due to the shipment of titles published by Square EA.


                                       16

<PAGE>

o      Over 190%  increase in online  subscription  revenues  for North  America
       compared to the prior year due to  subscription  revenues  generated from
       Worldplay  and Kesmai  games and increase in average  paying  subscribers
       related to Ultima Online.
o      A 10% increase in PC revenues due to the continuing  strong catalog sales
       of The Sims, shipped in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, as well as the
       current year release of SimCity 3000 Unlimited and Shogun: Total War.

International Net Revenues

The slight  decrease in  international  net  revenues for the three months ended
June 30, 2000 compared to the three months ended June 30, 1999 was  attributable
to the following:

o      Europe's net revenues  decreased by 22% primarily due to market weakness,
       lower AL sales due to product  delays and lower  Nintendo 64 sales due to
       no new titles shipping in the current quarter.
o      Asia Pacific's net revenues  increased slightly due to strong PC sales of
       The Sims and  Shogun:  Total War offset by a decline in  PlayStation  and
       Nintendo 64 sales with no significant  new titles shipping in the current
       quarter.
o      Japan's  net  revenues  increased  over 250%  compared  to the prior year
       primarily  due to the  shipment of our first  PlayStation  2 title,  FIFA
       Soccer World Championship.

Personal Computer Product Net Revenues

We  released  four PC titles in the first  quarter of the  current  fiscal  year
compared to five PC titles for the same period last year. The worldwide increase
in sales of PC revenues  was  primarily  attributable  to the  continued  strong
catalog  sales of The Sims.  The  increase  was also due to the  shipment of key
releases  during  the  quarter,  including  sales  of Euro  2000,  SimCity  3000
Unlimited and Shogun:  Total War. This increase was mitigated by strong sales of
SimCity 3000 in the prior year.

We expect  revenues from PC products to grow in fiscal 2001, but as revenues for
these products increase, they may not grow at the current rate.


                                       17

<PAGE>

PlayStation Product Net Revenues

We released  one title for the  PlayStation  console in Europe and Asia  Pacific
only,  during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 compared to three titles released
worldwide  in the first  quarter  of  fiscal  2000.  The  expected  decrease  in
PlayStation  product sales was primarily  attributable to the shipment of only a
single title  during the first  quarter of the current year as compared to three
worldwide titles shipped in the same period last year.  Further  contributing to
the decrease was general PlayStation market weakness and shortage of PlayStation
hardware in both the United States and Europe.

Sony has announced the release of the PlayStation 2 console in the United States
in October 2000 and Europe in November 2000.  Although our PlayStation  products
will be  playable  on the  PlayStation  2  console,  we expect  sales of current
PlayStation products to continue to decline in fiscal 2001.

Under the  terms of a  licensing  agreement  entered  into  with  Sony  Computer
Entertainment of America in July 1994 (the "Sony Agreement"), as amended, we are
authorized  to develop and  distribute  software  products  compatible  with the
PlayStation.  Pursuant  to the Sony  Agreement,  we engage  Sony to  manufacture
PlayStation Compact Disks for distribution by us.  Accordingly,  we have limited
ability to control  our supply of  PlayStation  products  or the timing of their
delivery.

PlayStation 2 Product Net Revenues

We released  our first  PlayStation  2 console  title in Japan  during the first
quarter of fiscal 2001, FIFA Soccer World Championship, which had $10,281,000 in
net revenues.

Online Net Revenues

The  increase in online  revenues  for the three  months  ended June 30, 2000 as
compared  to the  three  months  ended  June 30,  1999 was  attributable  to the
following:

o      We  generated  over  $2,400,000  in  revenues  for Kesmai  and  Worldplay
       products in the current quarter which were not part of the EA.com product
       offerings in the prior year. It is anticipated that subscription revenues
       associated with Kesmai and Worldplay  products will decrease,  as most of
       these  games  will  be  converted  to  our  advertising-supported,   free
       offerings  when our game site goes live.  We  are  currently  in Beta and
       expect to go live in the late summer to fall of this year.
o      The average  number of paying  customers for Ultima  Online  increased to
       over 183,000 as compared to over 113,000 for the same period last year.
o      The increase in paying  customers was  partially due to continued  strong
       sales of Ultima Online, which includes new events, land masses, new homes
       and parties within the Ultima worlds.
o      In  addition,  we  established  servers  for  Ultima  Online  in Korea in
       September  1999,  Taiwan in November  1999 and  Australia in January 2000
       which resulted in new customers for the three months ended June 30, 2000,
       as compared to the same period last year.

Nintendo 64 Product Net Revenues

The  expected  decrease in N64 revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2000
compared  to the same  period  last year was  primarily  due to no new  products
released  during the current  quarter  and only one new  product  shipped in the
fourth quarter of last year. The decrease was


                                       18
<PAGE>

also due to the weak market for  Nintendo 64  products in the current  year.  We
expect revenues from N64 products to continue to decline significantly in fiscal
2001.

Under the terms of the N64 Agreement,  we engage Nintendo to manufacture our N64
cartridges  for  distribution  by us.  Accordingly,  we have  little  ability to
control our supply of N64 cartridges or the timing of their delivery. A shortage
of microchips  or other factors  outside our control could impair our ability to
obtain an adequate supply of cartridges.

In connection  with our purchases of N64  cartridges for  distribution  in North
America,  Nintendo requires us to provide irrevocable letters of credit prior to
Nintendo's  acceptance  of  purchase  orders  from  us for  purchases  of  these
cartridges.  For  purchases  of N64  cartridges  for  distribution  in Japan and
Europe,  Nintendo  requires  us to make  cash  deposits.  Furthermore,  Nintendo
maintains a policy of not accepting returns of N64 cartridges.  Because of these
and  other  factors,   the  carrying  of  an  inventory  of  cartridges  entails
significant capital and risk.

License, OEM and Other Revenues

The decrease in license,  OEM and other revenues was primarily a result of lower
license revenues in North America due to revenues generated from two significant
licensing deals signed in the prior year.

Affiliated Label Product Net Revenues

AL product  sales  decreased  during the  current  quarter  compared to the same
period last year due to lower sales in Europe  partially  offset by higher sales
in North America.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues
generated  from the  distribution  of titles by Square EA in the current year as
compared to the same period last year.

Operations by Segment

As a result of the  approval  of the  Tracking  Stock  proposal  (see Note 3) to
authorize  issuance of a new series of common stock designated as Class B common
stock,  intended  to reflect the  performance  of EA.com,  management  considers
EA.com  to  be  a  separate  reportable  segment.   Accordingly,   prior  period
information has been restated to disclose this separate  segment.  We operate in
two principal business segments globally:

o      Electronic Arts core ("EA Core") business  segment:  creation,  marketing
       and distribution of entertainment software.
o      EA.com  business  segment:   creation,   marketing  and  distribution  of
       entertainment  software  which can be played or sold  online and  ongoing
       management of subscriptions of online games.

EA.com, a division of Electronic Arts Inc.,  represents  Electronic Arts' online
and e-Commerce  businesses.  EA.com's  business includes  subscription  revenues
collected for Internet game play on our  websites,  sales of packaged  goods for
Internet-only based games and sales of Electronic Arts games sold through EA.com
websites.  The statement of operations  includes all revenues and costs directly
attributable to EA.com,  including charges for shared facilities,  functions and
services  used by EA.com and  provided by  Electronic  Arts.  Certain  costs and
expenses  have been  allocated  based on  management's  estimates of the cost of
services provided to EA.com by Electronic Arts.

The increase in net revenues for EA.com for the three months ended June 30, 2000
as compared to the three  months  ended June 30,  1999 was  attributable  to the
following:

o      Higher online revenues from increased subscriptions to Ultima Online.
o      Online revenues generated from Kesmai and Worldplay games.

The following table presents  pro-forma  results of operations  allocating taxes
between EA Core and EA.com.  Consolidated  taxes have been  allocated to EA Core
and EA.com on a pro rata basis based on the  consolidated  effective  tax rates,
thereby  giving  EA.com the tax  benefit of its losses  which is utilized by the
consolidated  group.  Such tax benefit  could not be  recognized  by EA.com on a
stand-alone basis. The sum of tax expense and tax benefit for EA Core and EA.com
is the same as  consolidated  tax expense  and tax  benefit.  This  presentation
represents how management analyzes each segment of the business (in thousands):

Cost of Goods Sold.  Cost of goods sold as a  percentage  of revenues  increased
during the three  months ended June 30, 2000 as compared to the same period last
year due to:

o      A decrease,  as a percentage of revenues,  of higher  margin  PlayStation
       products as compared to the prior year.
o      Lower margins from License/OEM revenues as compared to the prior year due
       to sales of low margin  products  in the  current  year.
o      A decrease in sales of higher margin AL co-published titles which made up
       a greater amount of total AL revenues in the same period last year.
o      Offset by a decrease in sales of lower margin N64 titles.
o      Also  partially  offset by higher  margin  subscription  revenues for the
       three  months  ended June 30,  2000 as  compared  to the same period last
       year.

Marketing and Sales.  Marketing and sales expenses increased in absolute dollars
by 4% primarily attributed to:

o      Increased  staff  required  for  EA.com  to  support  the  game  site and
       marketing-related   headcount   additions   associated  with  the  Kesmai
       acquisition  in the fourth  quarter  of fiscal  2000.  EA.com  intends to
       further increase  marketing and advertising  spending in order to promote
       our game site and Games Channel on AOL.
o      Increased advertising in Japan and Europe.
o      Offset by higher  prior  year  advertising  and sales  spending  in North
       America.

General and  Administrative.  General and  administrative  expenses increased in
absolute dollars by 25% primarily due to:

o      Increase in depreciation  expense for Europe due to the implementation of
       a new online transaction processing system.
o      The expansion of the EA.com staff and  additional  administrative-related
       costs  required  to  support  the  growth  of  the  EA.com  business.  We
       anticipate a continued  increase in the absolute dollars spent on general
       and administrative related expenses.

Research and  Development  (excluding  Network  Development  and  Support).  The
increase  in  absolute  dollars by 61% for  research  and  development  expenses
(excluding network development and support) was due to:

o      Increase  in  research  and  development  expenses  by  EA.com  due to an
       increase in the number of online  projects in  development  and increased
       development  staff.   Although  the  total  number  of  online  games  in
       development   at  any  given  point  going   forward  will  not  increase
       significantly,  the type of games that will be in  development  will most
       likely increase in complexity and depth.  To support this effort,  EA.com
       may be required to increase its development and production expenses.
o      Additional  headcount-related  expenses  attributable  to  the  increased
       in-house development capacity.
o      An increase in development  spending for next generation console products
       including development for the PlayStation 2 console.
o      The increase is also due to research and development  expenses related to
       the acquisition of a software  development  company in the fourth quarter
       of the prior fiscal year.

Network Development and Support. The increase in network development and support
expenses  was  primarily  due to  increased  spending  for  the  EA.com  network
infrastructure and the formation of the EA.com customer support  organization in
preparation for the live game site and the Games Channel on the AOL service.  As
a result,  we expect  network  development  and support  expenses to increase in
absolute dollars in the future.

Amortization of Intangibles.  The amortization of intangibles  results primarily
from the acquisitions of Westwood,  Kesmai, ABC Software and other acquisitions.
Amortization  of  intangibles  was  $3,240,000  for EA Core and  $1,414,000  for
EA.com.

Interest and Other Income,  Net.  Interest and other income,  net,  decreased in
absolute  dollars  primarily due to the realized gains on the sale of marketable
securities  and gain on the sale of a minority  interest in an  affiliate in the
prior  year.  Those  gains in the  prior  year were  partially  offset by higher
interest income in the current year.

Income  Taxes.  Our effective tax rate was 31.0% for the three months ended June
30, 2000 and 32.0% for the three months ended June 30, 1999.  The  effective tax
rate was lower than the comparable  prior year period primarily as a result of a
projected  higher portion of  international  income for fiscal 2001 subject to a
lower foreign tax rate as compared to the prior year.

Net Income (Loss).  In absolute dollars,  reported net loss increased  primarily
related to lower revenues and gross profits as well as higher costs and expenses
compared to the same period last year.  The increase was also due to an increase
in the number of products in  development  and higher  network  development  and
support costs in preparation  for new online  products and our game site and the
Games Channel on the AOL service.

Excluding  goodwill and  non-cash  charges in the amount of  $3,598,000,  net of
taxes,  in the current  year,  net loss would have been  $38,673,000.  Excluding
goodwill and non-cash  charges in the amount of $1,831,000,  net of taxes in the
prior year, net income would have been $4,157,000.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   As of June 30,  2000,  our  working  capital  was  $376,176,000  compared  to
$440,021,000  at  March  31,  2000.   Cash,  cash   equivalents  and  short-term
investments decreased by approximately $42,860,000 during the three months ended
June  30,  2000.  We  generated  $2,285,000  of cash  from  operations  and used
$50,668,000  in capital  expenditures.  In  addition,  $6,577,000  was  provided
through the sale of equity securities under our stock plans.

   Reserves for bad debts and sales returns  decreased from $65,067,000 at March
31, 2000 to $53,325,000 at June 30, 2000. Reserves have been charged for returns
of  product  and price  protection  credits  issued for  products  sold in prior
periods.  Management  believes  these  reserves are adequate based on historical
experience and its current estimate of potential returns and allowances.

   Our principal  source of liquidity is $296,944,000 in cash, cash  equivalents
and  short-term  investments.   Management  believes  the  existing  cash,  cash
equivalents,  short-term  investments,  marketable securities and cash generated
from operations  will be sufficient to meet cash and investment  requirements of
Electronic  Arts and  EA.com  for the next  twelve  months  and the  foreseeable
future.

   Included in the amounts above is the following for the EA.com business:

o              To date,  EA.com has been funded  solely by  Electronic  Arts. No
       interest  charge  has been  reflected  in the  accompanying  consolidated
       financial   statements.   Excess  cash  generated   from   operations  is
       transferred to Electronic  Arts. We anticipate  these funding  procedures
       will continue in the near-term.  Electronic  Arts may, at its discretion,
       provide  funds to EA.com  under a debt  arrangement,  instead of treating
       such funding as a capital contribution.

o              During  the  three  months  ended  June  30,  2000,  EA.com  used
       $33,942,000  of cash in operations,  $36,538,000 in capital  expenditures
       for  computer  equipment,  network  infrastructure  and related  software
       (including  $15,243,000  of  consulting,  hardware,  software  and direct
       payroll and  payroll-related  costs associated with the implementation of
       customized internal-use software), offset by $68,543,000 provided through
       the capital contribution from Electronic Arts.


Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  reached a consensus on issue No.
00-15  ("EITF  00-15"),  "Classification  in the  Statement of Cash Flows of the
Income  Tax  Benefit  Realized  by  a  Company  upon  Employee   Exercise  of  a
Nonqualified Stock Option". The EITF concluded that income tax benefits realized
upon an employee's  exercise of a nonqualified stock option should be classified
as an operating cash flow.  Accordingly,  the Company  reclassified tax benefits
resulting from the exercise of stock options on its  Consolidated  Statements of
Cash Flows.


                                       25

In July 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-10 ("EITF  00-10"),
"Accounting  for Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs",  and concluded  that all
amounts  billed to a customer  in a sale  transaction  related to  shipping  and
handling,  if any,  represent  revenue to the vendor and,  therefore,  should be
classified  as  revenue.  EITF 00-10 is  effective  no later  than the  required
implementation  date  for  SAB  101.  We do not  expect  EITF  00-10  to  have a
significant  impact on the  results of  operations,  financial  position or cash
flows on EITF 00-10's effective date.

In May 2000,  the Emerging  Issues Task Force  issued No. 00-14 ("EITF  00-14"),
"Accounting  for Certain Sales  Incentives".  EITF 00-14 states that for a sales
incentive that will not result in a loss on the sale of a product or service,  a
vendor  should  recognize the cost of the incentive at the latter of the date at
which the  related  revenue is recorded  or the date at which the  incentive  is
offered. If the sales incentive will result in a loss on the sale of the product
or service,  the vendor should not recognize a liability for the sales incentive
until the related revenue is recognized.  Secondly, for certain sales incentives
that  entitle a  customer  to receive a  reduction  in the price of a product or
service  in the form of a refund  or  rebate,  the  vendor  should  recognize  a
liability for those sales  incentives based on an estimated amount of refunds or
rebates that may be claimed by customers. The Task Force also concluded that the
reduction  in or refund  of the  selling  price  resulting  from any cash  sales
incentive  should be  classified  as a  reduction  in  revenue  and if the sales
incentive  offered is a free  product or service  delivered at the time of sale,
the cost of the free product or service should be classifed as an expense. We do
not  expect  EITF 00-14 to have a material  impact on the  Company's  results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-03 ("EITF  00-03"),
"Application of AICPA SOP 97-2, "Software Revenue  Recognition," to Arrangements
That Include the Right to Use  Software  Stored on Another  Entity's  Hardware",
which  discusses  the  effect on  revenue  recognition  of a  software  vendor's
obligation to host its software that previously was licensed to a customer.  The
EITF has reached the  conclusion  that, if the customer is unable to utilize the
software on the customer's  hardware or contract with another party unrelated to
the vendor to host the  software,  then the  arrangement  with the  customer  is
outside the scope of SOP 97-2 and should be treated as a service  contract.  The
adoption of EITF 00-03 did not have a material impact on our financial  position
and results of operations.

In March 2000, the Emerging  Issues Task Force issued No. 00-02 ("EITF  00-02"),
"Accounting for Web Site  Development  Costs".  EITF 00-02 states that all costs
relating to software used to operate a web site and relating to  development  of
initial  graphics and web page design should be accounted for using Statement of
Position ("SOP") 98-1. Under this SOP, costs incurred in the preliminary project
stage  should  be  expensed  as  incurred,  as  should  most  training  and data
conversion  costs.  External direct costs of materials and services and internal
direct  payroll-related  costs should be capitalized  once certain  criteria are
met. EITF 00-02 is effective for all fiscal  quarters  beginning  after June 30,
2000. Our accounting policy for internal-use  software, as required by SOP 98-1,
incorporated the requirements of EITF 00-02.

In December 1999, the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  ("SEC") issued Staff
Accounting  Bulletin No. 101("SAB 101"),  "Revenue  Recognition," which outlines
the basic criteria that must be met to recognize  revenue and provides  guidance
for  presentation of revenue and for disclosure  related to revenue  recognition
policies in financial  statements  filed with the SEC. SAB 101 is effective  the
fourth  fiscal  quarter of fiscal  years  beginning  after  December 15, 1999


                                      26

<PAGE>

as  amended  by SAB 101B.  We believe  the  adoption  of SAB 101 will not have a
material impact on our financial position and results of operations.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of  Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  ("SFAS  133")  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",   as  amended  by  SFAS  137
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging Activities - Deferral of the
Effective  Date of FASB  Statement No. 133 - an Amendment of FASB  Statement No.
133" and SFAS 138  "Accounting  for Certain  Derivative  Instruments and Certain
Hedging  Activities - an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133" which  establishes
accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments  and hedging
activities. The terms of SFAS 133 and SFAS 138 are effective as of the beginning
of the first  quarter of the fiscal  year  beginning  after June 15,  2000.  The
Company  is  determining  the effect of SFAS 133,  137 and 138 on its  financial
statements.

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  ("AICPA")
issued SOP 98-1,  "Accounting  for the Costs of Computer  Software  Developed or
Obtained  for  Internal  Use".  SOP 98-1  requires  that  consulting,  hardware,
software and direct  payroll-related costs associated with the implementation of
customized internal-use software be capitalized and amortized over the estimated
useful life of the  software.  These costs relate to game site  application  and
infrastructure  design and  development,  as well as costs  related to providing
customer  account  management  and  building  in  e-Commerce  functionality  and
interfaces.  SOP 98-1 is effective  for financial  statements  issued for fiscal
years  beginning  after  December  15,  1998.  As of  June  30,  2000,  we  have
capitalized  $30,303,000 of these costs  associated with the effort to build the
EA.com website and infrastructure.

RISK FACTORS

Electronic Arts' business is subject to many risks and  uncertainties  which may
affect our  future  financial  performance.  Some of those  important  risks and
uncertainties  which  may  cause  our  operating  results  to vary or which  may
materially and adversely affect our operating results are as follows:

                   Risk Factors Relating to Our Core Business

Platform  Transitions Such as the One Now Occurring Typically Depress the Market
for Video Game Software Until New Platforms Achieve a Wide Market Acceptance

     When new video game platforms are announced or introduced  into the market,
consumers  typically reduce their purchases of video games for current platforms
in anticipation of new platforms being available.  During that period,  sales of
our video  game  products  can be  expected  to slow or even  decline  until new
platforms have achieved a wide market and consumer acceptance.  We are currently
in such a  transition.  Sony has shipped its  PlayStation 2 product in Japan and
expects to ship the  PlayStation  2 console in North America in October 2000 and
Europe in November  2000.  Nintendo and Microsoft have also announced that their
new console systems will be released in calendar year 2001. Current sales of our
products  for the  existing  PlayStation  and  Nintendo 64  platforms  have been
adversely affected.  We expect this trend to continue until one or more of these
new consoles achieve a wide installed base of consumers.

New  Video  Game  Platforms  Create  Additional  Technical  and  Business  Model
Uncertainties

     Large  portions of our  revenues  are derived from the sale of products for
play on  proprietary  video game  platforms  such as the Sony  PlayStation.  The
success of our products is significantly affected by acceptance of the new video
game  hardware  systems and the life span of older  hardware  platforms  and our
ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful.

     Sometimes we will spend  development  and  marketing  resources on products
designed for new video game systems that have not yet achieved  large  installed
bases or will continue product development for older hardware platforms that may
have shorter life cycles than we expected.  Conversely, if we do not develop for
a  platform  that  achieves   significant  market  acceptance,   or  discontinue
development  for a platform  that has a longer  life cycle  than  expected,  our
revenue growth may be adversely affected.

     For example, the Sega Dreamcast console launched in Japan in early 1999 and
in the United States in September of 1999. We have no products under development
for this  platform.  Should this platform  achieve wide market  acceptance,  our
revenue  growth  may be  adversely  affected.  Similarly,  we intend to launch a
variety of products for the new Sony platform, the PlayStation 2, expected to be
released in the United States in October 2000.  Should that platform not achieve
wide acceptance by consumers,  we will have spent a  disproportionate  amount of
our resources for this platform. Additionally, we have not negotiated publishing
agreements with Sony, Sega or Nintendo for their next generation  platforms,  or
with  Microsoft  for their new console  system,  and we do not know  whether the
terms of those agreements will be favorable.

Product  Development  Schedules Are Frequently  Unreliable  and Make  Predicting
Quarterly Results Difficult

     Product development schedules,  particularly for new hardware platforms and
high-end multimedia personal computers, or PCs, are difficult to predict because
they involve creative processes,  use of new development tools for new platforms
and  the  learning  process,   research  and  experimentation   associated  with
development for new technologies.  For example, Tiberian Sun, which was expected
to ship in


                                       28

<PAGE>

fiscal 1999 at the time of our acquisition of Westwood Studios, was not released
until the second quarter of fiscal 2000 due to development delays. Additionally,
development  risks for CD-ROM  products  can cause  particular  difficulties  in
predicting  quarterly  results  because  brief  manufacturing  lead times  allow
finalizing products and projected release dates late in a quarter.  Our revenues
and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules,
and our failure to meet those  schedules  could  result in revenues and earnings
which fall short of analysts'  expectations  for any individual  quarter and the
fiscal year.

Our Business Is Both Seasonal and Cyclical

     Our  business  is highly  seasonal  with a  significant  percentage  of our
revenues  occurring  in the  December  quarter.  In our 2001  fiscal  year,  and
particularly  in the September  quarter,  we expect these seasonal  trends to be
magnified by general industry factors, including the current platform transition
and the concentration of our product releases in the second half of fiscal 2001.
In addition,  we are continuing to invest significantly in our online operation,
EA.com.  Accordingly, we expect significant losses in the September quarter. Our
business is also cyclical;  video game platforms  have  historically  had a life
cycle of four to six years,  and decline as more  advanced  platforms  are being
introduced.  As one group of  platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new
platforms are emerging,  buying  patterns may change.  Purchases of products for
older  platforms may slow at a faster rate than sales of new  platforms.  We are
currently  beginning  such a platform  transition.  Sega  introduced  its latest
platform  in the United  States in  September  1999,  and Sony has  shipped  its
PlayStation 2 console in Japan and expects to ship its  PlayStation 2 product in
North  America  in  October  2000 and  Europe in  November  2000.  Nintendo  and
Microsoft have also announced that their new console systems will be released in
calendar year 2001.  Sales of our current  products for the current Nintendo and
Sony platforms have already been adversely affected, and we expect this trend to
continue  until one or more new  platforms  achieves  a wide  installed  base of
consumers.

The Impact of e-Commerce and Online Games on Our Business Is Not Known

     While we do not currently derive significant  revenues from online sales of
our packaged  products,  we believe that such form of distribution will become a
more significant factor in our business in the future. E-commerce is becoming an
increasingly  popular method for conducting  business with  consumers.  How that
form of distribution will affect the more traditional  retail  distribution,  at
which we have historically had success, and over what time period, is uncertain.
In addition, we expect the number and popularity of online games to increase and
become a significant factor in the interactive games business  generally.  We do
not know  how that  increase  generally,  or the  emerging  business  of  EA.com
specifically, will affect the sales of packaged goods.

Our  Business,  Our  Products,  and Our  Distribution  Are Subject to Increasing
Regulation in Key Territories

     Legislation is increasingly  introduced which may affect the content of our
products and their distribution. For example, privacy rules in the United States
and Europe impose  various  restrictions  on our web sites.  Those rules vary by
territory while of course the Internet  recognizes no  geographical  boundaries.
Other countries such as Germany have adopted laws regulating content transmitted
over the Internet  that are stricter  than current  United  States laws.  In the
United  States,  in response  to recent  events,  the federal and several  state
governments are considering content  restrictions on products such as those made
by us as well as restrictions on distribution of such products.  Any one or more
of these factors could harm our business.


                                       29
<PAGE>

Our Platform  Licensors Are Our Chief  Competitors  and  Frequently  Control the
Manufacturing of Our Video Game Products

     Our  agreements  with  hardware   licensors,   which  are  also  our  chief
competitors,  typically  give  significant  control  to the  licensor  over  the
approval  and  manufacturing  of our  products.  This  fact  could,  in  certain
circumstances,  leave us unable to get our products  approved,  manufactured and
shipped to customers.  In most events, control of the approval and manufacturing
process by the platform  licensors  increases both our manufacturing  lead times
and costs as compared to those we can achieve  independently.  For  example,  in
prior years, we experienced delays in obtaining  approvals for and manufacturing
of  PlayStation  products which caused delays in shipping  those  products.  The
potential for additional delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products
continues with our platform licensors.  Such occurrences would harm our business
and adversely affect our financial performance.

Proliferation and Assertion of Patents Poses Serious Risks to our Business

     Many  patents  have  been  issued  that  may  apply  to  widely  used  game
technologies.  Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against Internet  implementations  of existing games.  Several such patents have
been  asserted  against us. For  example,  we currently  have a lawsuit  pending
regarding our publication of games that can be played both alone and with others
over the Internet in which the patent  holder has moved to enjoin the sale of EA
personal computer products that can be played alone and over the Internet.  Such
claims can harm our business.  We will incur substantial  expenses in evaluating
and defending  against such claims,  regardless of the merits of the claims.  In
the event that there is a  determination  that we have  infringed  a third party
patent,  we could incur  significant  monetary  liability and be prevented  from
using the rights in the future.


                  Risk Factors Relating to Our Online Business

Because of EA.com's Limited Operating History,  It Will Be Difficult To Evaluate
its Business and Prospects

     EA.com's  business is still in the  developing  stages,  so evaluating  its
business and prospects  will be more difficult than would be the case for a more
mature business.  We will continue to encounter the risks and difficulties faced
in  launching  a new  business,  and we may  not  achieve  our  goals  or may be
compelled to change the manner in which we seek to develop the  business.  These
uncertainties as to the future operations of EA.com will increase the difficulty
we face in completing  and pursuing the essential  plans for the  development of
the  business  and will also make it more  difficult  for our  stockholders  and
securities analysts to predict the operating results of this business.

EA.com Has a History of Losses and Expects To  Continue To Incur  Losses and May
Never Achieve Profitability

     EA.com has  incurred  substantial  losses to date,  including  the  current
fiscal  year.  We expect  EA.com to continue to incur  losses as it develops its
business.  EA.com will be required to maintain the significant support,  service
and product  enhancement  demands of online users, and we cannot be certain that
EA.com will produce  sufficient  revenues  from its  operations to support these
costs.  Even if profitability is achieved,  EA.com may not be able to sustain it
over a period of time.

Our Agreements  with America Online May Not Prove  Successful to the Development
of EA.com's Business

     We have  announced a series of agreements  with America  Online ("AOL") for
the offering of our games through AOL for online play. These agreements  require
that we make  substantial  guaranteed  payments  to AOL and that we  commit  our
resources to the pursuit of the online game opportunity. We


                                       30

<PAGE>

cannot be assured that the substantial  costs associated with the AOL agreements
will be justified by the revenues generated from that relationship. In addition,
restrictions  included  in the AOL  agreements  limiting  other  channels we may
develop for offering  online games may limit our ability to diversify our online
distribution  strategies.  Further, we are required under our agreement with AOL
to launch our game site within a specified  time period or be subject to certain
penalties,  including  AOL's  right  to  terminate  the  agreement.  We were not
successful  in meeting a June 1, 2000  initial  launch  target and we may not be
successful in achieving  other specified  launch targets.  The success for us of
the AOL  agreements  will  also be a  result  of  AOL's  performance  under  the
agreements, a factor over which we will have very little control.

We Have Very Limited Experience with Online Games and May Not Be Able To Operate
This Business Effectively

     Offering  games solely for online play is a substantial  departure from our
traditional business of selling packaged software games. We anticipate employing
various  pricing  models,  including  subscription  fees, "pay to play fees" and
advertising.  We have very little  experience  with  developing  optimal pricing
strategies  for online games and no  experience  in "pay to play"  pricing or in
securing   advertising   revenue  for  online   services.   Similarly,   we  are
inexperienced  in  predicting  usage  patterns  for our  games.  Because  of our
inexperience in this area, we may not be effective in achieving success that may
otherwise be attainable from offering our games online.

Online Games Have Risks That Are Not Associated with Our Traditional Business

     Online  games,   particularly  multiplayer  games,  pose  risks  to  player
enjoyment that do not generally apply to packaged game sales. Players frequently
would not be  acquainted  with other  players,  which may  adversely  affect the
playing  experience.  Social issues raised by a player's  conduct may impact the
experience  for other players.  We have not  determined  whether or how we might
monitor or proctor  player  behavior to mitigate  behavior that impairs the game
experience.  In addition,  there are substantial  technical challenges to be met
both in the  introduction  of our games online and in  maintaining  an effective
game  playing  environment  over  time.  If  these  risks  are not  successfully
controlled and technical challenges resolved,  potential customers for our games
may be unwilling to play in  sufficient  volume to allow us to attain or sustain
profitability.

We May Not Be Able To Obtain the Required Licenses To Offer Our Games Online

     If we are unable to reach terms with certain  licensors  for our games,  we
will  not be able to  offer  certain  of our  games  for  online  play.  Many of
Electronic Arts' most popular games feature  characters,  trademarks,  people or
concepts for which we have licenses from third  parties.  As an example,  our EA
SPORTS products  typically  contain content  licensed from a sports and players'
association. In certain instances, the terms of these licenses will not allow us
to offer the games for online play without negotiating an additional license. We
cannot be certain  that the  licensors  will be amenable to a license for online
games  involving  their  content or,  even if they are,  that we will be able to
reach  terms  with  them for such use.  We may be forced to agree to terms  that
ultimately materially impair the economic value to us of the online game market.

Proliferation  and  Assertion of Patents  Poses Serious Risks to the Business of
EA.com

     Many  patents  have been  issued  that may apply to  widely  used  Internet
technologies.  Additionally, many recently issued patents are now being asserted
against Internet  implementations  of older  technologies.  Several such patents
have been asserted against us. For example,  we currently have a lawsuit pending
regarding our publication of games that can be played both alone and with others
over the Internet in which the patent  holder has moved to enjoin the sale of EA
personal computer products that can be played alone and over the Internet.  Such
claims can harm our business.  We will incur substantial  expenses in evaluating
and defending against such claims, regardless of the merits of the


                                       31

<PAGE>

claims.  In the event that there is a  determination  that we have  infringed  a
third  party  patent,  we could  incur  significant  monetary  liability  and be
prevented from using the rights in the future.

Development of EA.com's Business Will Require Significant Capital, and We Cannot
Be Assured That It Will Be Available

     EA.com will not be successful  if it does not receive the very  substantial
financing  that will be required  to launch its  business.  Electronic  Arts has
agreed to provide a limited  amount of funding  to  EA.com,  but this  financing
alone will not be  sufficient  for the  development  of EA.com's  business.  Any
additional funding that is obtained from EA may either be treated as a revolving
credit  advance  or  would  increase  EA's  retained   interest  in  EA.com  and
correspondingly  decrease the interest of the holders of  outstanding  shares of
Class B common stock. The attraction of additional  equity or debt financing for
EA.com  from third  parties may not be possible or may only be possible on terms
that result in significant  dilution to Class A and Class B common  stockholders
or interest or other costs and debt-related restrictions on the operation of the
business.

If Use of the Internet  Does Not  Continue To Develop and  Reliably  Support the
Demands Placed on It by Electronic Commerce, EA.com's Business Will Be Harmed

     EA.com's success depends upon growth in the use of the Internet as a medium
for playing  games.  Although the Internet is  experiencing  rapid growth in the
number  of  users,  this  growth is a recent  phenomenon  and may not  continue.
Furthermore,  despite  this  growth  in  usage,  the  use  of the  Internet  for
sophisticated games like ours is relatively new. Our business would be seriously
harmed if:

o      use of the  Internet  does not  continue to increase  or  increases  more
       slowly than expected,

o      the infrastructure  for the Internet does not effectively  support online
       game play,

o      concerns over the secure  transmission of confidential  information  over
       public  networks  inhibit  the  growth  of the  Internet  as a  means  of
       conducting commercial transactions, or

o      government  regulations  regarding  Internet  content,  privacy  or other
       conditions impede the effectiveness of the Internet to users.

Capacity  Restraints  May  Restrict  the Use of the Internet as a Forum for Game
Play, Resulting in Decreased Demand for Our Products

     The Internet  infrastructure  may not be able to support the demands placed
on it by increased  usage or the limited  capacity of networks to transmit large
amounts of data.  Other risks  associated  with  commercial  use of the Internet
could slow its growth, including:

o      outages and other delays resulting from the inadequate reliability of the
       network infrastructure,

o      slow development of enabling technologies and complementary products, and

o      limited availability of cost-effective, high speed access.

     Delays  in the  development  or  adoption  of new  equipment  standards  or
protocols required to handle increased levels of Internet activity, or increased
governmental  regulation,  would cause the  Internet  to fail to gain,  or lose,
viability as a means of game playing. If these or any other factors cause use of
the Internet for commerce to slow or decline,  the Internet may not prove viable
as a commercial marketplace. This, in turn, would result in decreased demand for
EA.com's products and services.

To Become and Remain Competitive, EA.com Must Continually Develop and Expand New
Content. This Is Inherently Risky and Expensive.

     EA.com's  success  depends on our ability to develop  products and services
for the initial launch of the EA.com site and our ability to continually  expand
the  content on that site.  Our  agreement  with AOL  requires us to develop new
games under our  relationship  with AOL. We cannot assure you that products will
be  developed  on  time,  in a cost  effective  manner,  or  that  they  will be
successful.

We May Not Be Able To Respond to Rapid Technological Change

     The market for Internet  products and  services is  characterized  by rapid
technological  change and evolving  industry  standards.  Both in completing the
design and implementation of our network infrastructure and thereafter,  we will
be  required to  continually  improve  performance,  features,  reliability  and
capacity of our  network  infrastructure.  We cannot  assure you that we will be
successful  in  responding  rapidly  or  in a  cost  effective  manner  to  such
developments.

Increasing  Governmental  Regulation of the Internet  Could Limit the Market for
Our Products

     As Internet commerce continues to evolve, we expect that federal, state and
foreign governments will adopt laws and regulations covering issues such as user
privacy,  taxation of goods and services  provided over the  Internet,  pricing,
content and quality of products and services.  It is possible  that  legislation
could expose companies involved in electronic commerce to liability, taxation or
other  increased  costs,  any of which  could  limit the  growth  of  electronic
commerce  generally.  Legislation  could dampen the growth in Internet usage and
decrease its acceptance as a communications  and commercial  medium. If enacted,
these laws and regulations could limit the market for EA.com's products.

If We Do Not Maintain Our Relationship with Outside Consultants Such as Andersen
Consulting  and  Proxicom,  Our Ability To Develop Our Online  Business  Will Be
Impaired

     Because approximately 29% of the staff creating,  designing, and developing
the  infrastructure for EA.com's website and network interface is being provided
by outside  consultants  such as Andersen  Consulting  and Proxicom,  losing the
business  relationship  with  such  consultants  would  cause  EA.com to lose an
important  component  of its  website  implementation  team.  Given the  intense
competition  for  qualified  technical  consultants,  EA.com  may not be able to
retain these consultants or, if necessary, replace them. If it cannot do so, its
ability to develop its business will be impaired.

Our  Revenues  Have Been  Heavily  Dependent  on a Single  Product  and Would Be
Adversely Affected if That Product's Popularity Were To Decline

     In the near term,  EA.com's  revenues to date have  consisted  primarily of
revenues  from  sales  of our  online  product  Ultima  Online,  and we would be
adversely  affected if revenues from that product were to decline for any reason
and not be  replaced.  We expect the online game  market to become  increasingly
competitive,  and it is possible that other  producer's  current or future games
could cause our revenue from Ultima Online to decline.  In addition,  popularity
of Ultima Online could decline over time simply  because of consumer  preference
for new game experiences.

We Invest Very Heavily in Research and Development  and Network  Development and
Support for EA.com,  and We Cannot Be Assured That We Will Achieve Revenues That
Validate This Level of Spending

     We have  invested,  and  expect to  continue  to  invest,  very  heavily in
research and development and network development and support for our website and
online games. We will need to expand EA.com's  revenues  substantially for it to
achieve  profitability  with these levels of expenditure being required,  and we
may not be able to do so. If we cannot increase  revenues to profitable  levels,
the  value of EA.com  will be  impaired.  In order to  develop  the broad  games
offerings  that we envision  for our online  operations  it will be necessary to
engage in significant  developmental  efforts both to adapt existing EA games to
the  online  format  and to create new online  games.  Our  agreements  with AOL
require us to maintain a substantial  commitment to online game  development and
we  cannot  be  assured  that we  will  realize  acceptable  returns  from  this
investment.

Online  Product  Development   Schedules  Are  Unreliable  and  Make  Predicting
Quarterly Results Difficult

     Online product development schedules, particularly for Internet based games
are difficult to predict  because they involve  creative  processes,  use of new
development  tools,  Internet  latency  issues,  a  learning  process  to better
understand  Internet  based game  mechanics,  and research  and  experimentation
associated  with   development  for  new  online   technologies.   Additionally,
development risks for Internet based products can cause particular  difficulties
in predicting  quarterly results because of the challenges  associated with game
testing, live Beta testing,  integration into network servers and integration on
to the Games web site and impact  the  release  ("go  live")  dates of  products
during a particular  quarter.  Our revenues and operating costs are dependent on
our  ability to meet our product  "go live"  schedules,  and our failure to meet
those   schedules   could  result  in  revenues   falling   short  of  analysts'
expectations, with no corresponding decrease in expenses, resulting in increased
operating losses for EA.com.


                              General Risk Factors

We Face Intense Competition for Talent from Highly Valued Internet Companies

     Competition for employees in the interactive software business continues to
be intense.  Recently, the most intense competition for recruiting and retaining
key employees is from Internet companies.  The large equity positions frequently
offered to key executives  and creative  talent in such companies and the actual
or perceived  opportunity for rapid stock price  appreciation of these companies
make their compensation  packages attractive to those who are already working in
more mature companies.  This situation creates  difficulty for us to compete for
the attraction and retention of executive and key creative talent.

Because of the Intense Competition for Qualified Technical,  Creative, Marketing
and Other  Personnel,  We May Not Be Able To Attract  and  Retain the  Personnel
Necessary for our Businesses

     The market for technical, creative, marketing and other personnel essential
to the  development  of online  businesses and management of our online and core
businesses  is  extremely  competitive,  and we may not be able to  attract  and
retain the employees we need. In addition, the rising cost of real estate in the
San Francisco Bay area - the location of our  headquarters  and largest  studio,
has  increased  dramatically,  and has made  recruiting  from  other  areas  and
relocating   employees  to  our  headquarters  more  difficult.   If  we  cannot
successfully  recruit and retain the  employees we need,  our ability to develop
and manage our businesses will be impaired.

Foreign Sales and Currency Fluctuations

     For the  three  months  ended  June 30,  2000  international  net  revenues
comprised  54% of total  consolidated  net  revenues.  For the fiscal year ended
March 31, 2000  international net revenues  comprised 40% of total  consolidated
net revenues.  We expect  foreign sales to continue to account for a significant
and  growing  portion  of our  revenues.  Such sales are  subject to  unexpected
regulatory requirements, tariffs and other barriers. Additionally, foreign sales
are primarily made in local  currencies  which may fluctuate.  For example,  our
European revenues in fiscal 2000 were adversely impacted by a devaluation of the
Euro as compared to the prior year. Our foreign  currency  exposure may increase
if this  trend  continues.  Any of  these  factors  may  significantly  harm our
business.

Increased Difficulties in Forecasting Results

     During platform  transition  periods,  where the success of our products is
significantly impacted by the changing market for our products,  forecasting our
revenues and earnings is more  difficult  than in more stable or rising  product
markets. The demand for our products may decline during a transition faster than
we anticipate, negatively impacting both revenues and earnings.

Fluctuations in Stock Price

Due to  analysts'  expectations  of  continued  growth  and other  factors,  any
shortfall in earnings could have an immediate and significant  adverse effect on
the trading  price of our common stock in any given  period.  As a result of the
factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future,
the market price of our common stock  historically  has been, and we expect will
continue to be subject to significant  fluctuations over a short period of time.
These fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us, to changes in analysts'
earnings estimates,  or to factors affecting the computer,  software,  Internet,
entertainment,  media or  electronics  businesses or the  securities  markets in
general.  For example,  during  fiscal year ended March 31, 2000,  the price per
share of our common  stock  ranged  from  $45.63 to $120.94 and $53.19 to $78.13
during the three months ended June 30, 2000.


Because of these and other factors affecting our operating results and financial
condition,  past  financial  performance  should  not be  considered  a reliable
indicator of future performance,  and investors should not use historical trends
to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Item 3:  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk


MARKET RISK

We are  exposed  to  various  market  risks,  including  the  changes in foreign
currency  exchange rates and interest  rates.  Market risk is the potential loss
arising from changes in market rates and prices. Foreign exchange contracts used
to hedge foreign  currency  exposures and short-term  investments are subject to
market risk. We do not consider our cash and cash  equivalents  to be subject to
interest  rate  risk  due  to  their  short  maturities.  We do not  enter  into
derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We utilize foreign  exchange  contracts to hedge foreign  currency  exposures of
underlying assets and liabilities,  primarily certain  intercompany  receivables
that are denominated in foreign  currencies,  thereby,  limiting our risk. Gains
and losses on foreign exchange  contracts are reflected in the income statement.
At June 30, 2000, we had foreign exchange contracts, all with maturities of less
than nine  months to purchase  and sell  approximately  $238,692,000  in foreign
currencies,   primarily  British  Pounds,  European  Currency  Units  ("Euros"),
Canadian Dollars, Japanese Yen and other currencies.

Fair value  represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate
and the forward rate. The  counterparties to these contracts are substantial and
creditworthy   multinational   commercial   banks.  The  risks  of  counterparty
nonperformance  associated  with  these  contracts  are  not  considered  to  be
material.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks,  there
can be no assurances  that our hedging  activities  will  adequately  protect us
against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.

The table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange
contracts  at June  30,  2000.  The  information  is  provided  in  U.S.  dollar
equivalents  and presents the notional  amount  (forward  amount),  the weighted
average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While the  contract  amounts  provide  one  measurement  of the  volume of these
transactions,  they do not  represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk.
The amounts (arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the
terms of their contracts) are generally limited to the amounts, if any, by which
the counterparties' obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be
settled on a net basis at our  option.  We control  credit risk  through  credit
approvals, limits and monitoring procedures.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily
to our investment  portfolio.  We do not use derivative financial instruments in
our  investment  portfolio.  We manage our interest rate risk by  maintaining an
investment  portfolio  primarily  consisting of debt  instruments of high credit
quality and  relatively  short average  maturities.  We also manage our interest
rate risk by maintaining  sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that
we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity. At June 30, 2000, our
cash equivalents,  short-term and long-term investments included debt securities
of  $185,676,000.  Notwithstanding  our efforts to manage  interest  rate risks,
there can be no  assurances  that we will be  adequately  protected  against the
risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.

rates of our investment portfolio at June 30, 2000:
