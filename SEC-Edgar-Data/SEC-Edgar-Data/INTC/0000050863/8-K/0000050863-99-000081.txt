EXHIBIT 99.1

INTEL THIRD QUARTER REVENUE $7.3 BILLION, up 9%
Earnings excluding acquisition-related costs* $0.55 per share, up
22%
EPS $0.42, down 5%

SANTA  CLARA,  Calif.,  October  12,  1999  -  Intel  Corporation
announced  third quarter revenue of $7.3 billion,  up  9  percent
from  third  quarter 1998 revenue of $6.7 billion. Third  quarter
revenue  includes post-acquisition revenue of companies  acquired
in  the  third quarter.  Third quarter revenue was up  9  percent
from  second  quarter 1999 revenue which was also  $6.7  billion.
The company said that shipments of microprocessors, chipsets, and
flash  memory  all grew substantially to new records  during  the
quarter.

*Acquisition-related  costs consist  of  one-time  write-offs  of
purchased  in-process research and development  and  the  ongoing
amortization    of   goodwill   and   other   acquisition-related
intangibles.  Other acquisition-related intangibles include,  for
example,   the   value  of  the  acquired  companies'   developed
technology, trademarks and workforce-in-place. Earnings excluding
acquisition-related   costs  differ   from   earnings   presented
according  to  generally accepted accounting  principles  because
they exclude these costs.

<PAGE>

      Net  income  excluding acquisition-related costs  was  $1.9
billion  in  the  third  quarter, up 21 percent  from  the  third
quarter  of  1998  and up 7 percent sequentially.  Third  quarter
earnings  excluding  acquisition-related  costs  were  $0.55  per
share,  an increase of 22 percent from $0.45 in the third quarter
of 1998, and up 6 percent sequentially.

      Including  acquisition-related  costs  in  accordance  with
generally  accepted accounting principles, net  income  was  $1.5
billion,  down  6  percent from third quarter 1998  and  down  17
percent  sequentially.  Earnings per share  were  $0.42,  down  5
percent  from  $0.44 in the third quarter of  1998  and  down  18
percent sequentially.

      Acquisition-related costs in the third quarter consisted of
$333   million  in  one-time  charges  for  purchased  in-process
research  and  development and $121 million  of  amortization  of
goodwill  and  other  acquisition-related intangibles.  Effective
with  this  earnings release, the amortization  of  goodwill  and
other  acquisition-related intangibles is  shown  separately  and
prior periods' amounts are reclassified to be consistent with the
current basis of presentation. These costs were formerly included
in cost of sales.

      "Our microprocessor business was solid during the quarter,"
said  Craig  R.  Barrett, president and chief executive  officer.
"Revenues were up, units grew substantially to a new record,  and
we  introduced a large number of new products across  all  market
segments."

     "We look forward to seasonally strong business in the fourth
quarter," Barrett continued.  "We will aggressively ramp our high
performance  family  of  Pentium(R)III  microprocessors  on  0.18
micron process technology.  At the same time, we are accelerating
our   new   business  activities  in  networking,  communications
products,  and online services, as illustrated by the  number  of
acquisitions made in the third quarter."

      During  the quarter Intel acquired four companies; Dialogic
Corporation, Level One Communications, Softcom Microsystems, Inc.
and NetBoost Corporation.  These acquisitions were valued at over
$3   billion  in  total  and  significantly  strengthen   Intel's
networking  and communications product offerings.   Substantially
all  of  acquisition-related costs  for  the  third  quarter  are
related to these four acquisitions.

      During  the  quarter, the company paid its  quarterly  cash
dividend  of $0.03 per share.  The dividend was paid on September
1, 1999, to stockholders of record on August 7, 1999.  Intel has

<PAGE>

paid a regular quarterly cash dividend for seven years.

      During the quarter, the company repurchased a total of 12.8
million shares of common stock, at a cost of $911 million,  under
an ongoing program.  Since the program began in 1990, the company
has  repurchased 647.4 million shares at a total  cost  of  $17.3
billion.

BUSINESS OUTLOOK

The  following  statements  are based  on  current  expectations.
These  statements  are forward-looking, and  actual  results  may
differ materially.  These statements do not include the potential
impact of any mergers or acquisitions that may be completed after
September 25, 1999.

**  The company expects revenue for the fourth quarter of 1999 to
be up from third quarter revenue of $7.3 billion.

**  Gross  margin  percentage in the fourth quarter  of  1999  is
expected to be up a couple points from the third quarter.  In the
short term, Intel's gross margin percentage varies primarily with
revenue levels and product mix as well as changes in unit costs.

**  Expenses  (R&D, excluding in-process R&D, plus MG&A)  in  the
fourth quarter of 1999 are expected to be approximately 9  to  12
percent  higher  than  third quarter expenses  of  $1.8  billion,
primarily  due  to  higher seasonal spending on  advertising  and
marketing and a full quarter of expenses from companies  acquired
during the third quarter.  Expenses are dependent in part on  the
level of revenue.

**  R&D  spending, excluding in-process R&D, is  expected  to  be
approximately  $3.1 billion for the full year 1999,  up  slightly
from  previous  guidance of $3.0 billion  primarily  due  to  R&D
spending of companies Intel acquired during the quarter.

**  The  company expects interest and other income for the fourth
quarter  of  1999 to be approximately $280 million, depending  on
interest  rates, cash balances, the company's ability to  realize
expected gains, and assuming no unanticipated items.

**  The  tax  rate  for  the fourth quarter  is  expected  to  be
approximately  33 percent, excluding the impact  of  acquisition-
related  costs  from both prior and potential future  mergers  or
acquisitions.

**  Capital spending for 1999 is now expected to be approximately
$3.3  billion,  up  from previous guidance of $3.0  billion,  due
primarily to capital spending of the companies Intel

<PAGE>

acquired  during the third quarter and the earlier than  expected
capital ramp of Intel Online Services.

**  Depreciation for the fourth quarter of 1999 is expected to be
approximately $830 million.

**   Amortization   of  goodwill  and  other  acquisition-related
intangibles is expected to be approximately $185 million  in  the
fourth quarter.

      The above statements contained in this outlook are forward-
looking   statements  that  involve  a  number   of   risks   and
uncertainties.   In  addition to factors discussed  above,  among
other   factors  that  could  cause  actual  results  to   differ
materially are the following: the impact of the recent earthquake
in  Taiwan,  primarily on the availability of  components  to  PC
manufacturers; business and economic conditions and growth in the
computing  industry  in various geographic  regions;  changes  in
customer  order  patterns,  including  changes  in  customer  and
channel  inventory  levels and changes due to year  2000  issues;
changes   in  the  mixes  of  microprocessor  types  and  speeds,
purchased  components  and other products;  competitive  factors,
such  as rival chip architectures and manufacturing technologies,
competing  software-compatible microprocessors and acceptance  of
new  products  in  specific market segments;  pricing  pressures;
development  and  timing of introduction of  compelling  software
applications;  insufficient, excess  or  obsolete  inventory  and
variations   in   inventory  valuation;  continued   success   in
technological  advances, including development and implementation
of  new  processes  and strategic products  for  specific  market
segments;  execution  of the manufacturing  ramp,  including  the
transitions  to the Pentium III processor and to the 0.18  micron
process technology; excess or shortage of manufacturing capacity;
the ability to grow new businesses and successfully integrate and
operate  any  acquired businesses; unanticipated costs  or  other
adverse  effects  associated with processors and  other  products
containing  errata  (deviations from  published  specifications);
impact  on  the  company's business due to  internal  systems  or
systems  of  suppliers, infrastructure providers and other  third
parties adversely affected by year 2000 problems; claims  due  to
year  2000 issues allegedly related to the company's products  or
year  2000  remediation efforts; litigation involving  antitrust,
intellectual property, consumer and other issues; and other  risk
factors  listed from time to time in the company's  SEC  reports,
including  but  not limited to the report on Form  10-Q  for  the
quarter ended June 26, 1999 (Part I, Item 2, Outlook section).

PRO FORMA INFORMATION EXCLUDING ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS

The  following  pro forma supplemental information  excludes  the
effect  of amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related
intangibles  as well as in-process research and development.   As
these  acquisition-related  costs  are  substantially  all   non-
deductible  for income tax purposes, the only change to  the  tax
provision  in  arriving at the pro forma net income  is  a  small
increase  for  the  impact  of  deferred  taxes  related  to  the
amortization   of  identifiable  intangibles.  This   pro   forma
information is not prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
