INTEL TO REPLACE MOTHERBOARDS WITH DEFECTIVE MEMORY
TRANSLATOR HUB COMPONENT

SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- May 10, 2000 -- Intel Corporation today announced that
it would replace motherboards that have a defective memory translator hub
(MTH) component that translates signals from SDRAM memory to the
Intel-Registered Trademark- 820 Chipset. The MTH is only used with
motherboards utilizing SDRAM and the Intel 820 Chipset. The MTH began
shipping in November 1999; therefore systems shipped before that time are
unaffected by this issue.

Intel has identified system noise issues with the MTH that can cause some
systems to intermittently reset, reboot and/or hang. In addition, the noise
issue can, under extreme conditions, potentially cause data corruption. In
some instances the company has been able to induce data corruption under
synthetic stress testing in its laboratories.

Intel is working with its customers (the computer makers, motherboard makers
and distribution channels) to notify computer users of this issue and to
offer a replacement motherboard. Computer users that want to know if their
system uses an MTH can contact their computer maker for more information, or
download a utility from Intel's web site (the Intel -Registered Trademark-
MTH I.D. Utility at www.intel.com/support/mth).

Intel plans to reserve for the cost associated with this replacement program
when the cost can be determined.  Depending upon the user replacement rate,
the amount of this reserve could be material.

Normally the Intel 820 Chipset is used with a different memory -- RDRAM.
RDRAM-based systems are not impacted since they don't use the memory
translator hub.

Intel, the world's largest chip maker, is also a leading manufacturer of
computer, networking and communications products. Additional information
about Intel is available at www.intel.com/pressroom.
