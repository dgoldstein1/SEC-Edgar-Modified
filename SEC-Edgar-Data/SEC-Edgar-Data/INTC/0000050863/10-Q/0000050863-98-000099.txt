Item 1.  Financial Statements (continued)

Intel Corporation, Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements

1.  The accompanying interim consolidated condensed financial statements of
    Intel Corporation ("Intel," the "Company" or the "Registrant") have been
    prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
    consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Annual
    Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 1997. The interim
    financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal adjustments
    which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to provide a fair
    statement of results for the interim periods presented. The interim
    financial statements should be read in connection with the financial
    statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
    ended December 27, 1997.

2.  As of the second quarter of 1998, the Company adopted a new dividend
    declaration schedule which will result in the Board of Directors
    considering two dividend declarations in the first and third quarters of
    the year and no declarations in each of the second and fourth quarters
    of the year. The new declaration schedule does not change the Company's
    historical quarterly dividend payment schedule. In keeping with this new
    schedule, no dividend was declared in the second quarter of 1998, and on
    July 22, 1998 the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $.03 per
    share payable on September 1, 1998 to stockholders of record on August 7,
    On September 16, 1998, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly
    dividend of $.04 per share payable on December 1, 1998 to stockholders of
    record on November 7, 1998.

4.  The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
    No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," as of the first quarter of 1998.
    SFAS No. 130 establishes new rules for the reporting and display of
    comprehensive income and its components, however it has no impact on the
    Company's net income or total stockholders' equity.

    The components of comprehensive income, net of tax, are as follows (in
    millions):

5.  Between December 27, 1997 and March 14, 1998, approximately 78 million of
    the Company's 1998 Step-Up Warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock
    were exercised at a price of $20.875 per share. Approximately 78 million
    shares of Common Stock were issued, and the Company received proceeds of
    approximately $1.6 billion. The expiration date of these warrants was March
    14, 1998.

6.  During the first nine months of 1998, the Company repurchased 64.4 million
    shares of Common Stock under the Company's authorized repurchase program at
    a cost of $5.2 billion, including $1.2 billion to purchase 15 million
    shares upon the exercise of outstanding put warrants. During the first
    quarter of 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved an increase in
    the repurchase program of up to 100 million additional shares, bringing the
    total authorization to 380 million shares. As of September 26, 1998, after
    allowing for the outstanding put warrants, approximately 94.7 million shares
    remained available for repurchase under the program. (See Item 2.
    Management's Discussion and Analysis for subsequent activity.)

7.  In a series of private placements during the 1991-1998 period, the Company
    sold put warrants that entitle the holder of each warrant to sell to the
    Company, by physical delivery, one share of Common Stock at a specified
    price. Activity during the first nine months of 1998 is summarized as
    follows:

</TABLE>
    A total of 2.5 million put warrants were sold to commercial and investment
    banks during August 1998. They expire on various dates between January and
    February 1999 and have exercise prices ranging from $79.50 to $82 per share,
    with an average exercise price of $80.  The 7.5 million put warrants
    outstanding on September 26, 1998 expire on various dates between October
    1998 and February 1999 and have exercise prices ranging from $70 to $82 per
    share, with an average exercise price of $78. The amount related to the
    Company's potential buyback obligation has been reclassified from
    Stockholders' Equity and recorded as put warrants. There is no material
    dilutive effect on earnings per share for the periods presented. (See Item
    2. Management's Discussion and Analysis for subsequent activity.)

8.  In September 1998, the Company repriced $80 million of the 1983 Series A
    Adjustable Rate Industrial Revenue Bonds ("Series A Bonds") issued by the
    Puerto Rico Industrial, Tourist, Educational, Medical and Environmental
    Control Facilities Financing Authority. The Series A Bonds will bear
    interest at the rate of 4.25% through August 2003. Bondholders of
    approximately $59 million agreed to retain the bonds at the adjusted
    interest rate. The balance of approximately $21 million was remarketed.
    The bonds, which were included in current liabilities at December 27, 1997
    due to the redemption option, have been reclassified to long-term debt as a
    result of the refinancing.

9.  In January 1998, the Company acquired the outstanding shares of Chips and
    Technologies, Inc., a supplier of graphics accelerator chips for mobile
    computing products. The purchase price was approximately $430 million ($321
    million in net cash). During the first quarter of 1998, the Company recorded
    a nondeductible charge of $165 million for purchased in-process research and
    development, representing the appraised value of products still in the
    development stage that were not considered to have reached technological
    feasibility and had no alternative future use.

    In May 1998, the Company purchased the semiconductor operations of Digital
    Equipment Corporation, including manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts
    as well as development operations in Israel and Texas, for approximately
    $625 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments. Assets acquired
    consisted primarily of property, plant and equipment. Following the
    completion of the purchase, lawsuits between the companies that had been
    pending since 1997 were dismissed with prejudice.

10. SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities," was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in 
    June 1998.  The Standard will require the Company to recognize all 
    derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not
    hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is
    a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value 
    of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of
    the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or
    recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is 
    recognized in earnings. The change in a derivative's fair value related 
    to the ineffective portion of a hedge, if any, will be immediately 
    recognized in earnings. The Company expects to adopt this Standard as of 
    the beginning of its fiscal year 2000. The effect of adopting the Standard
    is currently being evaluated, but is not expected to have a material effect
    on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

11. In November 1997, Intergraph Corporation ("Intergraph") filed suit in U.S.
    District Court in Alabama generally alleging that Intel attempted to coerce
    Intergraph into relinquishing certain patent rights and alleging
    infringement on three Intergraph patents as well as violations of antitrust
    laws and various state law claims. In April 1998, the Court ordered Intel to
    continue to treat Intergraph as it does allegedly similarly-situated
    customers. In June 1998, Intel answered the Amended Complaint of Intergraph
    and filed counter claims against Intergraph for infringement of seven
    patents covering various aspects of computer system performance. Also in
    June, Intel filed a motion for summary judgment on Intergraph's patent
    claims on the grounds that Intel is licensed to use those patents. In July,
    the Company received a letter stating that Intergraph believes that the
    patent damages will be "several billion dollars by the time of trial." In
    addition, Intergraph alleges that Intel's infringement is willful and that
    any damages awarded should be trebled. The letter also stated that
    Intergraph believes that antitrust, unfair competition and tort and
    contract damages will be "hundreds of millions of dollars by the time of
    trial." The Company disputes Intergraph's claims and intends to defend the
    lawsuit vigorously.

    In March 1995, EMI Group, NA ("EMI") brought suit in U.S. District Court in
    Delaware alleging infringement of a U.S. patent relating to processes for
    manufacturing semiconductors. In May 1996, the Court granted Intel's motion
    for summary judgment on some of the processes in issue. In November 1996,
    the Court granted Intel's motion for summary judgment on the remaining
    processes in issue and entered judgment in favor of Intel and against EMI
    on the claims of the complaint. A unanimous decision by the Court of Appeals
    affirmed this decision in September 1998.

    The Company is currently party to various legal proceedings, including
    those noted above. While management, including internal counsel, currently
    believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings will not have a
    material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or overall
    trends in results of operations, litigation is subject to inherent
    uncertainties. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, there exists the
    possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations of
    the period in which it occurs.

12. In October 1998, the Company announced that it had entered into a
    definitive agreement to acquire Shiva Corporation, whose products include
    remote access and virtual private networking (VPN) solutions for the small
    to medium enterprise market segment and the remote access needs of campuses
    and branch offices. Intel expects that the total cash required to complete
    the transaction will be approximately $185 million, before consideration of
    any cash to be acquired. This transaction is subject to approval by Shiva
    stockholders and is also subject to regulatory review.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
         Results of Operations

Results of Operations - Third Quarter of 1998 Compared to Third Quarter of 1997

Revenues for Q3 1998 increased by 9% compared to Q3 1997. Higher processor
volumes and a shift in mix toward processors based on the P6
micro-architecture** drove the overall growth in revenues. Revenues from sales
of chipsets and networking products also grew between these periods.

Cost of sales rose by 23% from Q3 1997 to Q3 1998 due to increased volumes and
additional costs associated with purchased components for the Single Edge
Contact ("SEC") cartridge in the Pentium(R) II processor. These cost increases
were partially offset by the impact of cost reduction efforts. Gross margin
decreased to 53% in Q3 1998 from 58% in Q3 1997 due to the impact of the SEC
cartridge, partially offset by the impact of cost reductions and a more
favorable product mix.

For Q3 1998, sales of microprocessors based on the P6 micro-architecture
represented a majority of the Company's revenues and a substantial majority of
its gross margin. For Q3 1997, these products represented a significant and
growing portion of both revenues and gross margin. Sales of Pentium(R)  family
microprocessors did not represent a significant portion of the Company's
revenues and gross margin in Q3 1998, but they constituted a majority of
revenues and gross margin in Q3 1997. No other product group represented a
significant portion of the Company's revenues or gross margin during Q3 1998
or Q3 1997.

Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative
expenses rose by a total of $121 million, or 10%, from Q3 1997 to Q3 1998,
primarily due to increased spending on product development programs and higher
merchandising and Intel Inside(R) expenses. Operating expenses were 20.5% of
revenues in both Q3 of 1998 and Q3 1997.

Interest income and other for Q3 1998 increased by $21 million over the prior
year due primarily to higher gains on sales of equity investments, partially
offset by lower foreign currency gains.

The provision for taxes for Q3 1998 decreased by $99 million over the prior
year as a result of lower pretax earnings and a lower effective tax rate.
The effective tax rate decreased from 35.5% for Q3 1997 to 33% for Q3 1998.

Results of Operations - First Nine Months of 1998 Compared to First Nine
                        Months of 1997

Revenues for the first nine months of 1998 were essentially flat compared to
the first nine months of 1997. Higher processor unit volumes compared to the
first nine months of 1997 were offset by lower processor prices and lower
revenues from sales of flash memory and embedded control products. Revenues
from sales of chipsets and networking products increased.

Cost of sales rose by 24% from the first nine months of 1997 to the first nine
months of 1998 due to increased volumes and the shift in product mix to the P6
micro-architecture, reflecting the cost of purchased components for the SEC
cartridge.  Gross margin decreased to 52% in the first nine months of 1998 from
61% in the first nine months of 1997 primarily due to the impact of the SEC
cartridge and lower processor prices.

For the first nine months of 1998, sales of microprocessors based on the P6
micro-architecture represented a majority of the Company's revenues and a
substantial majority of its gross margin. For the first nine months of 1997,
these products represented a significant and growing portion of both revenues
and gross margin. Sales of Pentium family microprocessors represented a
significant but declining portion of the Company's revenues and

gross margin in the first nine months of 1998, and they constituted a
majority of revenues and a substantial majority of gross margin in the first
nine months of 1997. No other product group represented a significant portion
of the Company's revenues or gross margin during the first nine months of 1998
or 1997.

Research and development expenses and marketing, general and administrative
expenses rose by a total of $333 million, or 9%, from the first nine months
of 1997 to the first nine months of 1998, and included a one-time charge of
$165 million for in-process research and development related to the
acquisition of Chips and Technologies, Inc. which was completed in the first
quarter of 1998. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher levels of
research and development spending on product development programs.  Operating
expenses were 22.2% of revenues in the first nine months of 1998 versus 20.6%
in the first nine months of 1997.

Interest income and other for the first nine months of 1998 decreased by $54
million over the prior year.  Net gains associated with the Company's equity
investments and foreign currency gains were lower than in the first nine months
of 1997, partially offset by interest on a higher average investment balance.

The provision for taxes for the first nine months of 1998 decreased by $810
million over the prior year primarily as a result of a decrease in pretax
earnings. The effective tax rate decreased from 35.5% for the first nine months
of 1997 to 33% for the first nine months of 1998, excluding the impact of the
nondeductible charge related to the acquisition of Chips and Technologies, Inc.


Financial Condition

The Company's financial condition remains very strong. As of September 26,
1998, cash, trading assets and short- and long-term investments totaled $10.5
billion, down from $11.8 billion at December 27, 1997. The Company's other
sources of liquidity include authorized commercial paper borrowings of up to
$700 million.  The Company also maintains the authority to issue an aggregate
of approximately $1.4 billion in debt, equity and other securities under
Securities and Exchange Commission shelf registration statements.

Major sources of cash during the first nine months of 1998 included cash
generated from operations, which totaled $5.5 billion, and approximately $1.6
billion received upon the exercise of the 1998 Step-Up Warrants.  Major uses
of cash during the first nine months of 1998 included capital spending of $2.9
billion for property, plant and equipment, primarily for microprocessor
manufacturing capacity, $5.2 billion to buy back 64.4 million shares of Common
Stock and $946 million in net cash paid for the purchase of Chips and
Technologies, Inc. and the semiconductor manufacturing operations of Digital
Equipment Corporation ("Digital").

The Company's five largest customers accounted for approximately 41% of net
revenues for the nine month period ended September 26, 1998. At September 26,
1998, these customers accounted for approximately 38% of net accounts
receivable.

Key financing activities in the first nine months of 1998 included the
repurchase of 64.4 million shares of Common Stock for $5.2 billion as part of
the Company's authorized stock repurchase program, including $1.2 billion for
the purchase of 15 million shares upon the exercise of outstanding put
warrants. The Company also sold 7.5 million put warrants, receiving proceeds
of $40 million, while 11.3 million put warrants expired unexercised.  From
September 26, 1998 through November 3, 1998, the Company repurchased 10.6
million shares of its Common Stock at a cost of $932 million and 5 million put
warrants expired unexercised. As of November 3, 1998, Intel had the potential
obligation to repurchase 2.5 million shares of Common Stock at an aggregate
cost of $201 million under outstanding put warrants. The exercise price of
these outstanding warrants ranged from $80 to $82 per share, with an average
exercise price of $80 per share. During the first quarter of 1998, the
Company's Board of

<PAGE> 11

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued)

Financial Condition (continued)

Directors approved an increase of up to 100 million additional shares in the
Company's repurchase program. This increase brought the total authorization to
380 million shares. As of November 3, 1998, 89.1 million shares remained
available for repurchase under the authorization, after allowing for the
outstanding put warrants.

In October 1998, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire Shiva Corporation. Intel expects that the total cash
required to complete the transaction will be approximately $185 million, before
consideration of any cash to be acquired. This transaction is subject to
approval by Shiva stockholders and is also subject to regulatory review. In
addition, during October 1998, the Company made a $500 million investment to
acquire a minority nonvoting equity interest in Micron Technology, Inc,.

Management considers cash flow from operations and available sources of
liquidity to be adequate to meet business requirements in the foreseeable
future, including the acquisition and the investment described above, planned 
capital expenditure programs, working capital requirements, the put warrant 
obligation and the dividend program.


Outlook

The outlook section contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of
which are based on current expectations. Actual results may differ materially.
These statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers or
acquisitions that have not closed as of the end of the third quarter of 1998.

The Company expects revenue for the fourth quarter of 1998 to be up
approximately 8 to 10 percent from the third quarter revenue of $6.7 billion.
This represents a change from the previous guidance that fourth quarter revenue
would be up slightly from the third quarter.  Revenue is partly a function of
the mix of microprocessor types and speeds, purchased components and other
products, all of which are difficult to forecast. Because of the large price 
difference between types of microprocessors, this mix affects the average 
price Intel will realize and has a large impact on Intel's revenues. Revenue
is also subject to the rate of growth of the computing industry and the
impact of business and economic conditions, such as the current global
financial difficulties.

Intel's strategy is to introduce ever-higher performance microprocessors
tailored for the different segments of the worldwide computer market, using a
tiered branding approach. To implement this strategy, the Company plans to
cultivate new businesses and continue to work with the software industry to
develop compelling applications that can take advantage of this higher
performance, thus driving demand toward the newer products in each computer
market segment. In line with this strategy, the Company is seeking to develop
higher performance microprocessors for each market segment, including servers,
workstations, high-end business PCs, the basic PC and other product lines.
During the third quarter, the Company launched the Pentium(R) II Xeon(TM)
processor (for mid- and high-range servers and workstations), and introduced
higher performance versions of the Pentium II processor (for desktops and 
entry-level servers and workstations), the Celeron(TM) brand processor
(for basic PC users) and the Pentium II processor for mobile PCs. The Company 
may continue to reduce microprocessor prices at such times as it deems 
appropriate in order to bring its technology to market within each relevant 
market segment.

The Company now expects the gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter of
1998 to be up a couple of points from 53 percent in the third quarter. Previous
guidance was that margin would be flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter.
Intel's gross margin percentage in any period varies depending on the level of
revenues and on the mix of types and speeds of microprocessors sold, as well as
the mix of microprocessors and purchased components. The Pentium II processor
is packaged with purchased components in the SEC cartridge, and the inclusion
of purchased components tends to increase unit costs. Accordingly, sales of the
Pentium II processor increase absolute dollar margins but tend to lower the
gross margin percentage. Various other factors (including

<PAGE> 12

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued)

Outlook (continued)

unit volumes and costs, yield issues associated with production at factories,
ramp of new technologies, excess or obsolete inventory, variations in inventory
valuation and mix of shipments of other semiconductors) will also continue to
affect the amount of cost of sales and the variability of gross margin
percentages.

The Company has expanded manufacturing capacity over the last few years and
continues to plan capacity based on the assumed continued success of its
strategy and the acceptance of its products in specific market segments. The
Company currently expects capital expenditures for 1998 to be approximately
$4.2 billion, down from $4.5 billion in 1997.  This is less than the guidance
for the year of $4.5 to $4.7 billion given in the Form 10-Q for the second
quarter, primarily as a result of a facilities realignment and the Company's
continued efforts to control costs. The current estimate includes the
acquisition of the capital assets of Digital's semiconductor manufacturing
operations. This spending plan is dependent upon expectations regarding
manufacturing efficiencies, delivery times of various machines and construction
schedules for new facilities. Depreciation for the fourth quarter of 1998 is
expected to be approximately $780 million.

Spending on research and development and marketing, general and administrative
expenses in the fourth quarter of 1998 is expected to be approximately 8 to 10
percent higher than the $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 1998, up from
earlier guidance of 3 to 5 percent higher than third quarter expenses. Expense
projections for the fourth quarter of 1998 incorporate expected higher
merchandising, Intel Inside(R) and profit dependent expenses.  Total spending
is subject in part to changes in revenue and profit dependent expenses. Research
and development spending for the fourth quarter of 1998 is expected to be
approximately $650 million.

Intel is still making progress on reducing headcount and the Company expects to
be within a few hundred people of its previously announced headcount reduction
target of approximately 3,000 employees by the end of the year.  In 1999, the
Company expects to complete other previously announced headcount reduction plans
at manufacturing locations in Massachusetts and Puerto Rico.

The Company expects interest and other income for the fourth quarter of 1998 to
be approximately $200 million, up from earlier guidance of $160 million,
assuming no significant changes in expected interest rates or cash balances,
and no unanticipated items.

The tax rate for the fourth quarter of 1998 is expected to be 33%.

Intel has established a team to address the issues raised by the introduction
of the Single European Currency (Euro) for initial implementation as of January
1, 1999 and during the transition period through January 1, 2002.  Intel
expects that its internal systems that will be affected by the initial
introduction of the Euro will be Euro capable by January 1, 1999, and does not
expect the costs of system modifications to be material. The Company does not
presently expect that introduction and use of the Euro will materially affect
the Company's foreign exchange and hedging activities, or the Company's use of
derivative instruments, or will result in any material increase in costs to the
Company. While Intel will continue to evaluate the impact of the Euro
introduction over time, based on currently available information, management
does not believe that the introduction of the Euro currency will have a
material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or overall trends
in results of operations.

Like many other companies, the year 2000 computer issue creates risks for
Intel. If internal systems do not correctly recognize and process date
information beyond the year 1999, there could be an adverse impact on the
Company's operations. There are two other related issues which could also lead
to incorrect calculations or failures: i) some systems' programming assigns
special meaning to certain dates, such as 9/9/99, and ii) the fact that the
year 2000 is a leap year. To address these year 2000 issues with its internal
systems, the Company has initiated a comprehensive program which is designed
to deal with the most critical systems first (the Company has categorized as
"critical" or "priority" those systems whose failure would cause an extended
shut down of all or part

<PAGE> 13

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued)

Outlook (continued)

of a factory, could cause personal injury or would have a sustained and
significant detrimental financial impact). These activities are intended to
encompass all major categories of systems in use by the Company, including
network and communications infrastructure, manufacturing, facilities
management, sales, finance and human resources. The Company is also testing
customer and supplier interfaces as appropriate. The Company's manufacturing
equipment and systems are highly automated, incorporating PC's, embedded
processors and related software to control activity scheduling, inventory
tracking, statistical analysis and automated manufacturing. A significant
portion of the Company's year 2000 efforts on internal systems is intended
to prevent disruption to manufacturing operations. As of October 1998,
approximately 85% of the Company's critical and priority manufacturing systems
and 61% of critical and priority non-manufacturing systems were determined to
be already year 2000 capable, or replacements, changes, upgrades or workarounds
have been determined and tested. These replacements, changes and upgrades may
not yet have been deployed. The Company is in the process of planning a
comprehensive program of integration testing of internal systems. The
integration testing began in the third quarter of 1998 and will continue into
1999 as necessary.

The table below indicates the phases of the year 2000 project related to the
Company's critical and priority internal systems and the expected time frames.

Phases of the Project                  Start Date          End Date

Intel is also actively working with suppliers of products and services to
determine the extent to which the suppliers' operations and the products and
services they provide are year 2000 capable and to monitor their progress
toward year 2000 capability.  Highest priority is being placed on working with
suppliers that are critical to the business, defined by Intel as those whose
failure would shut down manufacturing or other critical operations within a
short period of time. The Company has made inquiry of its major suppliers and
to date has received responses to its initial inquiries from 100% of critical
suppliers. Follow-up activities seek to determine whether the supplier is
taking all appropriate steps to fix year 2000 problems and to be prepared to
continue functioning effectively as a supplier in accord with Intel's
standards and requirements. Contingency plans are being developed to address
issues related to suppliers that are not considered to be making sufficient
progress in becoming year 2000 capable in a timely manner. The Company is also
developing contingency plans to address possible changes in customer order
patterns due to year 2000 issues. As with suppliers, the readiness of customers
to deal with year 2000 issues may affect their operations and their ability to
order and pay for products.

Intel believes that its most reasonably likely worst case year 2000 scenarios
would relate to problems with the systems of third parties rather than with
the Company's internal systems or its products. It is clear that the Company
has the least ability to assess and remediate the year 2000 problems of third
parties and the Company believes the risks are greatest with infrastructure
(e.g. electricity supply, water and sewer service), telecommunications,
transportation supply chains and critical suppliers of materials.

The Company's microprocessor production is conducted in a network of domestic
and foreign facilities. Each location relies on local private and governmental
suppliers for electricity, water, sewer and other needed supplies. Failure of
an electricity grid or an uneven supply of power, as an example, would be a
worst case scenario that would completely shut down the affected facilities.
Electrical failure could also shut down airports and other transportation
facilities. The Company does not currently maintain facilities which would
allow it to generate its

<PAGE> 14

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (continued)

Outlook (continued)

own electrical or water supply in lieu of that supplied by utilities. To the
extent possible, the Company is working with the infrastructure suppliers for
its manufacturing sites, major subcontractor sites and relevant transportation
hubs to seek to better ensure continuity of infrastructure services.
Contingency planning regarding major infrastructure failure generally
emphasizes the shift of production to other, unaffected sites or planned
increases in inventory levels of specific products. Multiple plants engage in
similar tasks in the Intel system and production can be expanded in some sites
to partially make up for capacity unavailable elsewhere. Although overall
capacity would be reduced, it is not expected that the entire production system
would halt due to the unavailability of one or two facilities.

A worst case scenario involving a critical supplier of materials would be the
partial or complete shutdown of the supplier and its resulting inability to
provide critical supplies to the Company on a timely basis. The Company does
not maintain the capability to replace most third party supplies with internal
production. Where efforts to work with critical suppliers to ensure year 2000
capability have not been successful, contingency planning  generally emphasizes
the identification of substitute and second-source suppliers, and in certain
limited situations includes a planned increase in the level of inventory
carried.

The Company is not in a position to identify or to avoid all possible
scenarios; however, the Company is currently assessing scenarios and taking
steps to mitigate the impacts of various scenarios if they were to occur.
This contingency planning will continue through 1999 as the Company learns
more about the preparations and vulnerabilities of third parties regarding
year 2000 issues. Due to the large number of variables involved, the Company
cannot provide an estimate of the damage it might suffer if any of these
scenarios were to occur.

The Company also has a program to assess the capability of its products to
handle the year 2000. To assist customers in evaluating their year 2000 issues,
the Company has developed a list which indicates the capability of Intel's
current products, and certain products no longer being produced, to handle the
year 2000. Products are assigned to one of five categories as defined by the
Company: "Year 2000 Capable", "Year 2000 Capable" with update, not "Year 2000
Capable", under evaluation, or will not test.  The list is located at the
Company's Year 2000 support website and is periodically updated as analysis
on additional products is completed. All Intel processors are "Year 2000
Capable." All Intel microcontrollers (embedded processors) are also "Year 2000
Capable," with the exception of two custom microcontroller products which were
sold to a limited number of customers. However, the assessment of whether a
complete system will operate correctly depends on the firmware (BIOS)
capability and software design and integration, and for many end-users this
will include firmware and software provided by companies other than Intel. As
described more fully at the support website, Intel offers a "Year 2000 Capable"
Limited Warranty on certain of its current products. Except as specifically
provided for in the Limited Warranty, the Company does not believe it is
legally responsible for costs incurred by customers related to ensuring their
year 2000 capability. Nevertheless, the Company is incurring various costs to
provide customer support and customer satisfaction services regarding Year
2000 issues, and it is anticipated that these expenditures will continue
through 1999 and thereafter. An Intel product, when used in accordance with its
associated documentation, is "Year 2000 Capable" when, upon installation, it
accurately stores, displays, processes, provides, and/or receives data from,
into, and between 1999 and 2000, and the twentieth and twenty-first centuries,
including leap year calculations, provided that all other technology used in
combination with the Intel product properly exchanges date data with it.

Various of the Company's disclosures and announcements concerning its products
and year 2000 programs are intended to constitute "Year 2000 Readiness
Disclosures" as defined in the recently-enacted Year 2000 Information and
Readiness Disclosure Act. The Act provides added protection from liability for
certain public and private statements concerning an entity's year 2000
readiness and the year 2000 readiness of its products and services.  The Act
also potentially provides added protection from liability for certain types
of year 2000 disclosures made after January 1, 1996, and before the date of
enactment of the Act.

The Company's year 2000 efforts have been undertaken largely with its existing
personnel. In some instances, consultants have been engaged to provide specific
assessment, remediation or other services. Activities with suppliers and
customers have also involved their staffs and consultants. The Company engaged a
third party firm to assist with planning and taking the inventory of internal
systems and engaged another firm to perform an assessment of the overall scope
and schedule of Intel's year 2000 efforts.

The Company currently expects that the total cost of these programs, including
both incremental spending and redeployed resources, will not exceed $250
million. Approximately $35 million has been spent on the programs to date, of
which approximately $30 million was incurred in the first three quarters of
1998.  Costs in the fourth quarter of 1998 are expected to be approximately $30
million. A majority of the total estimated costs are expected to be incurred in
assessing and remediating issues with manufacturing systems, and as a result, a
majority of the total costs are expected to be included in cost of sales and in
the calculation of gross margin. Expected year 2000 costs for manufacturing and
non-manufacturing internal systems in 1998 represent less than 10% of the total
information technology budget for 1998. No significant internal systems
projects are being deferred due to the year 2000 program efforts. In some
instances, the installation schedule of new software and hardware in the normal
course of business is being accelerated to also afford a solution to year 2000
capability issues. The Company expects that costs related to accelerated
systems replacements will be approximately $15 million in addition to the total
costs noted above. In addition, the estimated costs do not include any
potential costs related to customer or other claims, or potential amounts
related to executing contingency plans, such as costs incurred on account of
an infrastructure or supplier failure. The Company has adequate general
corporate funds with which to pay for the programs' expected costs. All
expected costs are based on the current assessment of the programs and are
subject to change as the programs progress.

Based on currently available information, management does not believe that
the year 2000 matters discussed above related to internal systems or products
sold to customers will have a material adverse impact on the Company's
financial condition or overall trends in results of operations; however, it is
uncertain to what extent the Company may be affected by such matters. In
addition, there can be no assurance that the failure to ensure year 2000
capability by a supplier, customer or another third party would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or overall trends
in results of operations.

The Company is currently party to various legal proceedings. Although
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, management, including internal
counsel, does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these legal proceedings
will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or
overall trends in results of operations. However, were an unfavorable ruling
to occur in any specific period, there exists the possibility of a material
adverse impact on the results of operations of that period. Management
believes, given the Company's current liquidity and cash and investments
balances, that even an adverse judgment would not have a material impact on
cash and investments or liquidity.

The Company's future results of operations and the other forward-looking
statements contained in this outlook, in particular the statements regarding
revenues, pricing, new product development, gross margin, capital spending,
depreciation, research and development expenses, marketing and general and
administrative expenses, headcount reductions, net interest and other, tax
rate, conversion to the Euro, year 2000 issues and legal proceedings involve
a number of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the factors discussed
above, among the other factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially are the following: changes in customer order patterns, including
changes in customer and channel inventory levels; competitive factors, such
as rival chip architectures and manufacturing technologies, competing
software-compatible microprocessors and acceptance of new products in specific
market segments; pricing pressures; continued success in technological
advances, including development and implementation of new processes and
strategic products for specific market segments; execution of the

manufacturing ramp; effects of excess or shortage of manufacturing capacity;
unanticipated costs or other adverse effects associated with processors and
other products containing errata (deviations from published specifications);
impact on the Company's business due to internal systems or systems of
suppliers and other third parties adversely affected by year 2000 problems;
and litigation involving antitrust, intellectual property, consumer and other
issues.

Intel believes that it has the product offerings, facilities, personnel, and
competitive and financial resources for continued business success, but future
revenues, costs, margins and profits are all influenced by a number of factors,
as discussed above, all of which are inherently difficult to forecast.





Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

For financial market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates, reference is made to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in the Registrant's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 1997 and to the subheading
"Financial Market Risks" under the heading "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" on page 23 of the
Registrant's 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders.

The Company is exposed to equity price risks on the marketable portion of
equity securities included in its portfolio of investments entered into for the
promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally
in companies in the high-technology industry sector, many of which are small
capitalization stocks. The Company typically does not attempt to reduce or
eliminate its market exposure on these securities. A 20% adverse change in
equity prices, based on a sensitivity analysis of the Company's investment
portfolio as of September 26, 1998, would result in an approximate $120
million decrease in the fair value of the Company's available-for-sale
securities. This represents an update to the equity risk disclosure contained
in the 1997 Annual Report to Stockholders based an increase in the dollar
value of the marketable portion of the portfolio of equity investments. Actual
results may differ materially.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
- ---------------------------
Item 1.   Legal Proceedings


Reference is made to Item 3. Legal Proceedings, in the Registrant's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 1997 and to Part II,
Item 1. Legal Proceedings, in the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the quarterly periods ended March 28, 1998 and June 27, 1998 for
descriptions of the following and other legal proceedings.

                         Intergraph Corporation v. Intel
   U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama, Northeastern Division
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               (CV-97-N-3023-NE)
                               -----------------
In June of this year, Intel filed a motion for summary judgment on Intergraph's
patent claims on the grounds that Intel is licensed to those patents. In
September, Intergraph filed their opposition to that motion and filed its own
motion which seeks summary judgment in its favor on the same issue. Although
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and the ultimate outcome of
this lawsuit cannot be determined at this time, management, including internal
counsel, does not believe that the ultimate outcome will have a material
adverse effect on Intel's financial position or overall trends in results of
operations.


                      EMI Group, NA v. Intel, DEL (C95-199)
                      -------------------------------------
In March 1995, the plaintiff brought suit in U.S. District Court in Delaware
alleging infringement of a U.S. patent relating to processes for manufacturing
semiconductors. In May 1996, the Court granted Intel's motion for summary
judgment on some of the processes in issue. In November 1996, the Court granted
Intel's motion for summary judgment on the remaining processes in issue and
entered judgment in favor of Intel and against the plaintiff on the claims of
the complaint. A unanimous decision by the Court of Appeals affirmed this
decision in September 1998.



Item 2.   Changes in Securities


(c)    Unregistered sales of equity securities.

Reference is made to the information on sales of put warrants appearing in Note
7 under the heading "Intel Corporation, Notes to Consolidated Condensed
Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1 hereof.  All such transactions are
exempt from registration under Section 4 (2) of the Securities Act of 1933.
Each transaction was privately negotiated and each offeree and purchaser was
an accredited investor/qualified institutional buyer. No public offering or
public solicitation was used by the registrant in the placement of these
securities.



Item 5.   Other Information

On September 16, 1998 the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the
Company's Bylaws to temporarily increase the number of authorized members of
the Board of Directors from 11 to 12. The number of authorized members will
automatically revert to 11 following the 1999 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

of election of directors and for such other business as may lawfully come
before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors, but in no event more than fifteen
(15) months after the date of the preceding annual meeting.

          Section 3.  Special Meetings.
          ---------   ----------------     Special meetings of the
stockholders of the corporation may be called, for any purpose or purposes, 
by the Chairman of the Board or the President or the Board of Directors at 
any time.

          Section 4.  Notice of Meetings.
          ---------   ------------------
          (a)  Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders, specifying the
place, date and hour and purpose or purposes of the meeting, shall be given not
less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting to each
stockholder entitled to vote thereat, directed to his address as it appears
upon the books of the corporation.

<PAGE>

          (b)  If at any meeting action is proposed to be taken which, if
taken, would entitle stockholders fulfilling the requirements of section 262(d)
of the Delaware General Corporation Law to an appraisal of the fair value of
their shares, the notice of such meeting shall contain a statement of that
purpose and to that effect and shall be accompanied by a copy of that statutory
section.

          (c)  When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice
need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place thereof are
announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken unless the
adjournment is for more than thirty days, or unless after the adjournment a
new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, in which event a notice of
the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
vote at the meeting.

          (d)  Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of
stockholders may be waived in writing, either before or after such meeting, and
to the extent permitted by law, will be waived by any stockholder by his
attendance thereat, in person or by proxy.  Any stockholder so waiving notice of
such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all
respects as if due notice thereof had been given.

          (e)  Unless and until voted, every proxy shall be revocable at the
pleasure of the person who executed it or of his legal representatives or
assigns, except in those cases where an irrevocable proxy permitted by statute
has been given.

          Section 5.  Quorum and Voting.
          ---------   -----------------
          (a)  At all meetings of stockholders, except where otherwise
provided by law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, the
presence, in person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum
for the transaction of business.  Shares, the voting of which at said meeting
have been enjoined, or which for any reason cannot be lawfully voted at such
meeting, shall not be counted to determine a quorum at said meeting.  In the
absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to
time, by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented thereat,
but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting.  At such adjourned
meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.  The
stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum is
present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding
the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.

          (b)  Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority of
the voting power represented at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall
be valid and binding upon the corporation.

<PAGE>

          Section 6.  Voting Rights.
          ---------   -------------
          (a)  Except as otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose
names shares entitled to vote stand on the stock records of the corporation on
the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at said
meeting shall be entitled to vote at such meeting.  Shares standing in the
names of two or more persons shall be voted or represented in accordance with
the determination of the majority of such persons, or, if only one of such
persons is present in person or represented by proxy, such person shall have
the right to vote such shares and such shares shall be deemed to be represented
for the purpose of determining a quorum.

          (b)  Every person entitled to vote or execute consents shall have
the right to do so either in person or by an agent or agents authorized by a
written proxy executed by such person or his duly authorized agent, which proxy
shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation at or before the meeting
at which it is to be used.  Said proxy so appointed need not be a stockholder.
No proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date unless the proxy
provides for a longer period.

          Section 7.  List of Stockholders.
          ---------   ---------------------     The officer who has charge of
the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten days
before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders
entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the
address of and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least
ten days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the
meeting is to be held and which place shall be specified in the notice of the
meeting, or, if not specified, at the place where said meeting is to be held,
and the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of meeting during
the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

          Section 8.  Action Without Meeting.
          --------- ------------------------    Unless otherwise provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required by statute to be taken
at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any 
action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such 
stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and 
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action 
so taken, are signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than 
the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such 
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present 
and voted.  To be effective, a written consent must be delivered to the 
corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal 
place of business, or an officer or agent of the corporation having custody 
of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.  
Delivery made to a corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by 
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.  Every written 
consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the
consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action 
referred to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent 
delivered in the manner required by this Section to the corporation, 
written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action 
are delivered to the 

<PAGE>

corporation in accordance with this Section.  Prompt notice of the taking of
the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing.

          Section 9.  Nominations and Stockholder Business.
          ---------   ------------------------------------
          (a)  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors
of the Corporation and the proposal of business to be considered by the
stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (a) pursuant to
the Corporation's notice of meeting, (b) by or at the direction of the Board
of Directors, or (c) by any stockholder of the Corporation who is a stockholder
of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 9, who
is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 9.

          (b)  For nominations or other business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to this Section 9, the
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary
of the Corporation, and such business must be a proper subject for stockholder
action under the Delaware General Corporation Law.   To be timely, a
stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Corporation not less than 45 days nor more than 120
days prior to the date on which the Corporation first mailed its proxy
materials for the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided,
however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by
more than 30 days or delayed (other than as a result of adjournment) by more
than 30 days from the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be delivered not later than the
close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting
or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of
such meeting is first made.  Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (a) as
to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or
reelection as a director all information relating to such person that  is
required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors,
or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including
such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a
nominee and to serving as a director if elected); (b) as to any other business
that the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description
of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for
conducting such business at the meting and any material interest in such
business of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf
the proposal is made; and (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the
beneficial owners if any on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i)
the name and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's
books, and of such beneficial owner, and (ii) the class and number of shares of
the Corporation which are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder
and such beneficial owner.

<PAGE>

          (c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9 to the contrary, in
the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors
of the Corporation is increased and there is no public announcement specifying
the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation at least
70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting,
a stockholder's notice required by this Section 9 shall also be considered
timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by such
increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day
following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the
Corporation.

          (d)  Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting.  Nominations of persons for election to the
Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which
directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting
(a)  by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder
of the Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of
notice provided for in this section, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and
who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this section.  Nominations
by stockholders of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made
at such a special meeting of Stockholders if the stockholder's notice required
by this section shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Corporation not earlier than the 120th day prior to such special
meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 60th day
prior to such special meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting and of the
nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting.

          (e)  Only those persons who are nominated in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this section shall be eligible for election as
directors at any meeting of stockholders.  Only such business shall be
conducted at a meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section.  The
chairman of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a
nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and, if any
proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this section, to
declare that such defective proposal shall be disregarded.

          (f)  For purposes of this section, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly
filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to Section 9 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

          (g)  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set
forth in this Section 9.  Nothing in this Section 9 shall be deemed to affect

<PAGE>

any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the
Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

                                 ARTICLE III
                                  Directors
                                  ---------
          Section 1.  Number and Term of Office.
          ---------   -------------------------   The number of directors
which shall constitute the whole of the Board of Directors shall be twelve
(12).  With the exception of the first Board of Directors, which shall be
elected by the incorporator, and except as provided in Section 3 of this
Article III, the directors shall be elected by a plurality vote of the shares
represented in person or by proxy, at the stockholders annual meeting in each
year and entitled to vote on the election of directors.  Elected directors
shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until their successors
shall be duly elected and qualified.  Directors need not be stockholders.  If,
for any cause, the Board of Directors shall not have been elected at an annual
meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special
meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in
these Bylaws.

          Section 2.  Powers.
          ---------   ------  The powers of the corporation shall be
exercised, its business conducted and its property controlled by or under the
direction of the Board of Directors.

          Section 3.  Vacancies.
          ---------   ---------   Vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors may be filled
by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum,
or by a sole remaining director, and each director so elected shall hold office
for the unexpired portion of the term of the director whose place shall be
vacant, and until his successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.  A
vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this Section
in the case of the death, removal or resignation of any director, or if the
 stockholders fail at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be
elected (including any meeting referred to in Section 4 below) to elect the
number of directors then constituting the whole Board.

          Section 4.  Resignations and Removals.
          ---------   -------------------------
          (a)  Any director may resign at any time by delivering his written

Committee in these Bylaws.

          (c) Term:
              -----  The members of all committees of the Board of Directors
shall serve a term coexistent with that of the Board of Directors which shall
have appointed such committee.  The Board, subject to the provisions of
subsections (a) or (b) of this Section 9, may at any time increase or decrease

the committee.  The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified
member at any meeting of the committee, and, in addition, in the absence or
disqualification of any member of a committee, the member or members thereof
present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or
they constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board
of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or
disqualified member.

pursuant to this Section 9 shall be held at such times and places as are
determined by the Board of Directors, or by any such committee, and when
notice thereof has been given to each member of such committee, no further
notice of such regular meetings need be given thereafter; special meetings of
any such committee may be held at the principal office of the corporation
required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof; or at any
place which has been designated from time to time by resolution of such
committee or by written consent of all members thereof, and may be called by
any director who is a member of such committee, upon written notice to the
members of such committee of the time and place of such special meeting given
in the manner provided for the giving of written notice to members of the
Board of Directors of the time and place of special meetings of the Board of
Directors.  Notice of any special meeting of any committee may be waived in

<PAGE>

writing at any time after the meeting and will be waived by any director by
attendance thereat.  A majority of the authorized number of members of any
such committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, and
the act of a majority of those present at any meeting at which a quorum is
present shall be the act of such committee.

          Section 10.  Emeritus Director.

consultants to the Board of Directors and may be appointed by the Board to
serve as advisors and consultants to committees of the Board.  Emeritus
Directors may be invited to attend meetings of the Board or any committee of
the Board for which they have been appointed to serve as advisors and
consultants and, if present, may participate in the discussions occurring
during such meetings.  Emeritus Directors shall not be permitted to vote on
matters brought before the Board or any committee thereof and shall not be
counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum of the Board or the
committee is present.  Emeritus Directors shall receive no fee for their
services as Emeritus Directors.  Emeritus Directors will not be entitled to
receive reimbursement for expenses of meeting attendance, except as approved
by the Chairman of the Board.  Emeritus Directors may be removed at any time
by the Board of Directors.

entitled to consent (if such written consent is permitted under these Bylaws

not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten

lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date
shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior to such
action.  If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day

such share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall
have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws
of Delaware.

pursuant to which such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall be
issued, the signature of the persons signing and attesting the corporate seal
on such bond, debenture or other corporate security may be the imprinted
facsimile of the signatures of such persons.  Interest coupons appertaining to
any such bond, debenture or other corporate security, authenticated by a
trustee as aforesaid, shall be signed by the Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer
of the corporation, or such other person as may be authorized by the Board of
Directors, or bear imprinted thereon the facsimile signature of such person.
In case any officer who shall have signed or attested any bond, debenture or
other corporate security, or whose facsimile signature shall appear thereon or
before the bond, debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested
shall have been delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security
nevertheless may be adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as
though the person who signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have
been used thereon had not ceased to be such officer of the corporation.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

          ----------  ------------------------  Each person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved (as a party,
witness, or otherwise), in any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit,
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative
(hereinafter a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he, or a person of
whom he is the legal representative, is or was a director, officer, employee,
or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, including
service with respect to employee benefit plans, whether the basis of the
Proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer,
employee, or agent or in any other capacity while serving as a director,
officer, employee, or agent (hereafter an "Agent"), shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the
Delaware General Corporation Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended or interpreted (but, in the case of any such amendment or
interpretation, only to the extent that such amendment or interpretation
permits the corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than were
permitted prior thereto) against all expenses, liability, and loss (including
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or penalties, and amounts
paid or to be paid in settlement, and any interest, assessments, or other
charges imposed thereon, and any federal, state, local, or foreign taxes
imposed on any Agent as a result of the actual or deemed receipt of any
payments under this Article) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in
connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in, or participating
in (including on appeal), or preparing for any of the foregoing in, any
Proceeding (hereinafter "Expenses"); provided, however, that except as to
actions to enforce indemnification rights pursuant to Section 3 of this
Article, the corporation shall indemnify any Agent seeking indemnification in
connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only
if the Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors
of the corporation.  The right to indemnification conferred in this Article
shall be a contract right.

          Section 2.  Authority to Advance Expenses.
          ---------   -----------------------------  Expenses incurred by an
officer or director (acting in his capacity as such) in defending a Proceeding
shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such
Proceeding, provided, however, that if required by the Delaware General
Corporation Law, as amended, such Expenses shall be advanced only upon
delivery to the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director
or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he
is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this
Article or otherwise.  Expenses incurred by other Agents of the corporation
(or by the directors or officers not acting in their capacity as such,
including service with respect to employee benefit plans) may be advanced upon
such terms and conditions as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.  Any
obligation to reimburse the corporation for Expense advances shall be
unsecured and no interest shall be charged thereon.

<PAGE>

          Section 3.  Right of Claimant to Bring Suit.
          ----------  -------------------------------  If a claim under
Section 1 or 2 of this Article is not paid in full by the corporation within
thirty (30) days after a written claim has been received by the corporation,
the claimant may at any time thereafter bring suit against the corporation to
recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part,
the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense (including
attorneys' fees) of prosecuting such claim.  It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in defending a Proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the
required undertaking has been tendered to the corporation) that the claimant
has not met the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the
Delaware General Corporation Law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed.  The burden of proving such a defense shall be on the
corporation.  Neither the failure of the corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a
determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification
of the claimant is proper under the circumstances because he has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation
Law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including its Board of
Directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the claimant
had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the
action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable
standard of conduct.

          Section 4.  Provisions Nonexclusive.
          ---------   -----------------------  The rights conferred on any
person by this Article shall not be exclusive of any other rights that such
person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors, or otherwise, both as to action in an official
capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.  To
the extent that any provision of the Certificate, agreement, or vote of the
stockholders or disinterested directors is inconsistent with these Bylaws,
the provision, agreement, or vote shall take precedence.

          Section 5.  Authority to Insure.
          ---------   -------------------  The corporation may purchase
and maintain insurance to protect itself and any Agent against any Expense,
whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify the Agent
against such Expense under applicable law or the provisions of this Article.

          Section 6.  Survival of Rights.
          ---------   ------------------  The rights provided by this
Article shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be an Agent and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a
person.

          Section 7.  Settlement of Claims.
          ---------   --------------------  The corporation shall not be
liable to indemnify any Agent under this Article (a) for any amounts paid in
settlement of any action or claim effected without the corporation's written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; or (b) for any
judicial award if the corporation was not given a reasonable and timely
opportunity, at its expense, to participate in the defense of such action.

<PAGE>

          Section 8.  Effect of Amendment.
          ---------   -------------------  Any amendment, repeal, or
modification of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of any Agent existing at the time of such amendment, repeal,
or modification.

          Section 9.  Subrogation.
          ---------   -----------  In the event of payment under this
Article, the corporation shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment
to all of the rights of recovery of the Agent, who shall execute all papers
required and shall do everything that may be necessary to secure such rights,
including the execution of such documents necessary to enable the corporation
effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.

          Section 10.  No Duplication of Payments.
          ----------   --------------------------  The corporation shall not
be liable under this Article to make any payment in connection with any claim
made against the Agent to the extent the Agent has otherwise actually received
payment (under any insurance policy, agreement, vote, or otherwise) of the
amounts otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.

                                    ARTICLE X
                                     Notices
                                     -------
          Whenever, under any provisions of these Bylaws, notice is
required to be given to any stockholder, the same shall be given in writing,
timely and duly deposited in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, and
addressed to his last know post office address as shown by the stock record of
the corporation or its transfer agent.  Any notice required to be given to any
director may be given by the method hereinabove stated, or by telegram, except
that such notice other than one which is delivered personally, shall be sent
to such address as such director shall have filed in writing with the
Secretary of the corporation, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last
known post office address of such director.  If no address of a stockholder or
director be known, such notice may be sent to the office of the corporation
required to be maintained pursuant to Section 2 of Article I hereof.  An
affidavit of mailing, executed by a duly authorized and competent employee of
the corporation or its transfer agent appointed with respect to the class of
stock affected, specifying the name and address or the names and addresses of
the stockholder or stockholders, director or directors, to whom any such
notice or notices was or were given, and the time and method of giving the
same, shall be conclusive evidence of the statements therein contained.  All
notices given by mail, as above provided, shall be deemed to have been given
as at the time of mailing and all notices given by telegram shall be deemed
to have been given as at the sending time recorded by the telegraph company
transmitting the same.  It shall not be necessary that the same method of
giving be employed in respect of all directors, but one permissible method may
be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other permissible method
or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.  The period or
limitation of time within which any stockholder may exercise any option or
right, or enjoy any privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within
which any director may exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege,
pursuant to any notice sent him in the manner above provided, shall not be
affected or extended in any manner by the failure of such a stockholder or
such director to receive such notice.  Whenever any notice is required to be
given under the provisions of the statutes or of the Certificate of
Incorporation, or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing signed by the
person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time
stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.  Whenever notice is
required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom
communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not
be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority
or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person.  Any
action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to any such
person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and

<PAGE>

effect as if such notice had been duly given.  In the event that the action
taken by the corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate
shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was
given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with
whom communication is unlawful.

                                    ARTICLE XI
                                    Amendments
                                    ----------
          Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation,
these Bylaws may be repealed, altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by
written consent of stockholders in the manner authorized by Section 8 of
Article II, or at any meeting of the stockholders, either annual or special,
by the affirmative vote of a majority of the stock entitled to vote at such
meeting.  The Board of Directors shall also have the authority to repeal,
alter or amend these Bylaws or adopt new Bylaws (including, without
limitation, the amendment of any Bylaws setting forth the number of directors
who shall constitute the whole Board of Directors) by unanimous written
consent or at any annual, regular, or special meeting by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the whole number of directors, subject to the power of the
stockholders to change or repeal such Bylaws and provided that the Board of
Directors shall not make or alter any Bylaws fixing the qualifications,
classifications, term of office or compensation of directors.
