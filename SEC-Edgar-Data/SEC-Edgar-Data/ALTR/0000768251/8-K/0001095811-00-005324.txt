                ALTERA AGREES TO SELL WAFERTECH INTEREST TO TSMC

     SAN JOSE, CALIF., December 14, 2000--Altera Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTR)
today announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its 23% equity
ownership interest in WaferTech, LLC, to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC) for $350 million cash. Altera expects to close the transaction by
the end of the year and to record a one-time pre-tax gain of approximately $170
million in the quarter ending December 31, 2000.

     WaferTech was founded in 1996 as a joint venture company with TSMC and
several other partners to build and operate a wafer manufacturing plant in
Camas, Washington.

     TSMC, one of the world's leading independent semiconductor foundries, will
remain Altera's strategic manufacturing partner. TSMC has been the largest
source of wafers for Altera, and Altera expects that TSMC, including the Camas
foundry, will continue to supply a significant portion of Altera's wafer needs
for the foreseeable future.

     "Our unique relationship with TSMC represents one of the most important
elements behind our success. We are confident that TSMC's advanced manufacturing
technology and superb operating performance will generate continued benefits for
our customers," said Denis Berlan, executive vice president and chief operating
officer.
