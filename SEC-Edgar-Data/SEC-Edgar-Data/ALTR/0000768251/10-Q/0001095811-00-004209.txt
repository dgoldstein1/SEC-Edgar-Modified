              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (UNAUDITED)


Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation:

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial information of
Altera Corporation and subsidiaries, referred to herein as we, us or our, has
been prepared by us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
and reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
which in our management's opinion are necessary to state fairly our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000 and 1999. The December 31, 1999 balance sheet was
derived from audited financial statements on that date. All significant
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as
well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results will differ from those estimates, and such differences
may be material to the financial statements. These condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 1999 included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, as filed on March 24, 2000 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2000 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future
periods.

This interim period ended on the Friday nearest September 30th. For presentation
purposes, the interim financial statements and accompanying notes refer to our
interim periods ending as of September 30th.

Note 3 - Comprehensive Income:

Comprehensive income, including net income and unrealized gain or loss on
available-for-sale investments, was $118.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2000 and $291.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2000. Comprehensive income approximated net income of $55.6 million for the
three months ended September 30, 1999 and $153.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1999.

<PAGE>   7

Accumulated other comprehensive loss presented in the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2000 consists of the accumulated
unrealized loss on available-for-sale investments, net of income taxes.


Note 4 - Common Stock Split:

On July 13, 2000, we declared a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100
percent stock dividend to holders of record of our common stock on July 26,
2000. Dividend shares were distributed to stockholders on August 10, 2000. All
prior period share and income per share data have been retroactively restated to
give effect to the stock split for all periods presented.


Note 5 - Income Per Share:

Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period and excludes the
dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock. Diluted income per share
reflects the dilution of potential common shares outstanding during a period. In
computing diluted income per share, the tax benefit resulting from employee
stock transactions, unamortized deferred stock-based compensation and the
average stock price for the period are used in determining the number of shares
assumed to be repurchased with the proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

A reconciliation of basic and diluted income per share is presented below (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

Note 6 - Common Stock Repurchase:

During the second quarter of 2000, we repurchased 4,830,000 shares of common
stock for an aggregate cost of $187.4 million. In October 2000, we repurchased
an additional 5,700,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $175.6
million. The repurchased shares were retired upon acquisition. In connection
with our stock split declared in July 2000, our Board of Directors approved
increasing, from 12,000,000 to 24,000,000, the number of shares authorized for
repurchase under our repurchase program. In addition, during October 2000, our
Board of Directors approved a further increase of the number of shares
authorized for repurchase to 48,000,000. Since the inception of our repurchase
program in 1996, we have repurchased a total of 23,300,000 shares.

Note 7 - Put Warrants:

In December 1999 and June 2000, we sold put warrants to independent third
parties. These put warrants entitle the holders the right to sell 2,500,000
shares of our common stock to us at specified prices on stated maturity dates.
The cash proceeds from the sale of the put warrants of $7.0 million in 2000 and
$2.4 million in 1999 have been included in capital in excess of par value. As of
September 30, 2000, warrants for 1,500,000 shares expired unexercised while
warrants for 1,000,000 shares were still outstanding. The outstanding warrants
expire in November 2000 and count against the 48,000,000 shares authorized for
repurchase under our common stock repurchase program. The outstanding put
warrants have exercise prices ranging from $32.97 to $34.40 per share.


Note 8 - New Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, or SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133
establishes standards for accounting and reporting on derivative instruments for
periods beginning after June 15, 2000 and early adoption is permitted. SFAS No.
133 requires that all derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet
as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. Furthermore, SFAS
No. 133 requires current recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of
derivative instruments depending on the intended use of the derivative and the
resulting designation. In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities - An Amendment of SFAS No.
133. SFAS No. 138 amends the accounting and reporting standards for certain
derivatives and hedging activities. We expect that our adoption of SFAS No. 133,
which will become effective in our fiscal year 2001, will not have a material
effect on our financial statements.

In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, or FIN 44, "Accounting for
Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation, an Interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25". FIN 44 clarifies the application of Opinion No. 25 for (a) the
definition of employee for purposes of applying Opinion No. 25, (b) the criteria
for determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the
accounting consequences of various modifications to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination. The adoption of FIN 44, which
became effective July 1, 2000, did not have a material effect on our financial
statements.


Note 9 - Acquisitions:

We completed the acquisitions of all outstanding capital stock of DesignPRO
Inc., a developer and provider of intellectual property cores and custom design
solutions, on April 19, 2000, Right Track CAD Inc., a developer of architectural
and computer aided design tools for advanced programmable logic devices, on May
1, 2000, and Northwest Logic, Inc., a provider of system design services and
intellectual property specializing in telecommunications, data communications
and embedded processor systems design, on September 11, 2000.

We issued 934,381 shares of our common stock and paid approximately $11.5
million in cash, net of cash acquired of $0.3 million, for all of the capital
stock of DesignPRO, Right Track and Northwest Logic. In addition, we granted
options to purchase 323,146 shares of our common stock in exchange for all of
the stock options outstanding of DesignPRO and Right Track. The fair value of
our shares issued was approximately $45.3 million and the fair value of our
options granted was approximately $14.6 million. We incurred direct acquisition
costs of approximately $0.4 million, which were included in the purchase price.
Total consideration for the three acquisitions was $72.1 million. The
acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The
purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed based in part on an independent appraisal of their
respective fair values. Total consideration paid in connection with the
acquisitions was attributable to the following (in thousands):

No supplemental pro forma information is presented due to the immaterial effect
on prior period results of operations.

The allocation of amounts to market ready technology and in-process research and
development were consistent with widely recognized appraisal practices. Our
analysis resulted in a valuation of market ready technology at $21.4 million.
Market ready technology represents technologies that had reached technological
feasibility, and therefore are capitalizable. We are amortizing the market ready
technology on a straight-line basis over a period of three to six years. Our
analysis also resulted in a $6.3 million charge to acquired in-process research
and development. The acquired in-process technology represents the appraised
value of technologies in the development stage that had not yet reached
technological feasibility and do not have alternative future uses. We expensed
this amount as a non-recurring charge upon consummation of the acquisitions.

We determined the value assigned to in-process research and development by
identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had
not been established. For both the Right Track and DesignPRO valuations, we
estimated the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable. We
then discounted the net cash flows back to their present value and applied a
percentage of completion. We determined the percentage of completion using
milestones representing our management's estimate of effort, value added, and
degree of difficulty of the portion of each project completed as of the
acquisition date, as compared to the remaining research and development to be
completed to bring each project to technical feasibility.

If we do not successfully develop our research projects discussed above, our
sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods and the
value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired. Our management
believes that the in-process research and development charge is valued
consistently with the SEC staff's current views regarding valuation
methodologies. We cannot assure you that the SEC staff will not take issue with
any assumptions used in our valuation model and require us to revise the amount
allocated to in-process research and development.


Note 10 - Deferred Stock-Based Compensation:

During the second quarter of 2000, we recorded aggregate deferred stock-based
compensation of $41.3 million representing the value of restricted stock issued
in conjunction with the acquisitions of DesignPRO and Right Track. During the
third quarter of 2000, we recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $7.5
million in conjunction with certain stock options granted to our new employees.
Deferred stock-based compensation represents the difference between the grant
price and the quoted market price of our stock at the date of grant. We are
amortizing deferred stock-based compensation over the vesting period of two to
four years. Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation was $3.5 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2000 and $5.3 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2000.

ITEM 2: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations

        The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, as well as information contained elsewhere
in this Report, contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Forward looking statements are generally written in the
future tense and/or are preceded by words such as "expects," "suggests,"
"believes," "anticipates," or "intends." Forward looking statements include
statements regarding future product and research and development efforts,
expected market demand for silicon wafers and potential supply shortages,
availability of funds and cash to finance operations and market risks relating
to our investment portfolio. Our future results of operations and the other
forward looking statements contained in this Report involve a number of risks
and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control. Some of these risks
and uncertainties are described in proximity to forward looking statements in
this Report. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
projected results include, but are not limited to, risks associated with our
ability to achieve continued cost reductions and maintain gross margins, our
ability to continue to achieve die size reductions, our ability to achieve and
maintain appropriate inventory mix and levels and respond successfully to
changes in product demand, the ability of price reductions to increase demand
and strengthen our market share over the long term, successful development and
subsequent introduction of new products through investment in research and
development and application of new process technologies to old and new product
lines, market acceptance of our new products, continued demand for our existing
products, and general market conditions. Additional risk factors are disclosed
in our 1999 Annual Report and Form 10-K on file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Sales

        Beginning with the second quarter of 2000, we classify our products by
supply voltage, replacing the previous methodology that classified products by
the categories New, Mainstream and Mature. We have updated all prior data to
reflect this change. In general, customers prefer products with lower supply
voltages because they use less power and dissipate less heat, normally resulting
in lower overall system cost. Lower supply voltages result from more advanced
fabricaton processes and yield higher performance at a lower cost. Thus, supply
voltage correlates with product maturity: lower supply voltages represent newer
products. We classify our products into the following supply voltage categories:

        -   1.8-volt products consist of the APEX 20KE family

        -   2.5-volt products include the MAX 7000B, FLEX 10KE, APEX 20K and
            ACEX 1K families

        -   3.3-volt products include the MAX 3000A/7000A, FLEX 6000 and FLEX
            10KA families

        -   5.0-volt products consist of the Classic, MAX 7000/7000S, MAX 9000,
            FLEX 8000 and FLEX 10K families

        -   Other products include tools, FLASHlogic, configuration devices and
            mask programmable logic devices, or MPLDs

        Sales during the third quarter of 2000 were $395.4 million, 83.8% higher
than the $215.1 million reported for the same period last year. The increase in
sales was primarily due to higher unit sales in all supply voltage categories.
The increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in the average unit
selling prices of higher voltage products. Sales of the 1.8-volt products, which
began shipping during the fourth quarter of 1999, were $18.2 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2000. Sales for 2.5-volt products increased
370.9% to $67.6 million from $14.3 million, 3.3-volt product sales increased
132.8% to $133.3 million from $57.3 million, 5.0-volt product sales increased
20.3% to $156.0 million from $129.7 million and sales of other products
increased 47.2% to $20.3 million from $13.8 million.

        Sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2000 were $1,008.9
million, 68.3% higher than the $599.3 million reported for the same period last
year. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher unit sales in all supply
voltage categories. The increase in sales was partially offset by a decrease in
the average unit selling prices of higher voltage products. Sales of the
1.8-volt products, which began shipping during the fourth quarter of 1999, were
$27.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000. Sales for 2.5-volt
products increased 511.6% to $140.9 million from $23.0 million, 3.3-volt product
sales increased 138.3% to $335.5 million from $140.8 million, 5.0-volt product
sales increased 14.9% to $450.3 million from $392.0 million and sales of other
products increased 26.1% to $54.9 million from $43.5 million.


                                       10
<PAGE>   11


        As a percentage of total sales, sales in North America, Europe and Asia
Pacific increased, while sales in Japan declined during the first nine months of
2000 compared to the first nine months of 1999. North America sales increased to
57.5% of sales from 56.3%, Europe increased to 21.7% from 18.7%, Asia Pacific
increased to 6.0% from 5.8%, while Japan decreased to 14.8% from 19.2%. In
absolute dollars, sales in North America increased 71.9% to $579.6 million from
$337.2 million, Europe increased 95.1% to $219.1 million from $112.2 million,
Asia Pacific increased 73.4% to $60.7 million from $35.0 million and Japan sales
increased 30.1% to $149.5 million from $114.9 million.

        As a percentage of total sales for the nine months ended September 30,
2000, sales to the communications market segment represented 68.0% of our
business as compared to 64.6% during the first nine months of 1999. The
electronic data processing market segment was 16.8% compared to 16.7%, the
industrial market segment was 10.2% compared to 12.0%, the consumer market
segment was 2.1% compared to 3.0% and other markets were 2.9% compared to 3.7%.
Our management believes that future revenue growth will be driven by product
demand in the communication market, but we cannot assure you that this will
occur.

        In October 1999, we sold to Cypress Semiconductor Corporation the
exclusive right to manufacture, market and sell our MAX 5000 product family and
our equity interest in Cypress Semiconductor (Texas), Inc. Excluding the MAX
5000 product family, total sales during the three months ended September 30,
2000 grew 86.3%, and total sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2000
grew 70.9%, each over the same period last year.

Gross Margin

        Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, for the three months ended
September 30, 2000 was 66.4% compared to 64.3% for the same period last year.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, gross margin was 66.1% compared to
63.6% for the same period last year. The increases in gross margin were
primarily attributable to cost reductions as a result of manufacturing process
improvements.

        Yields on newer, lower supply voltage products continued to improve for
the nine months ended September 30, 2000 over the same period a year ago. This
includes improvements in the APEX 20K/20KE, FLEX 10KE and FLEX 10KA product
families. We continue to spend a significant amount of financial resources to
improve production yields on both new and established products. Difficulties in
production yields can occur when we begin production of new products, transition
to new processes or when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC,
our principle wafer supplier, moves production of a product from one
manufacturing plant to another. These difficulties can potentially result in
significantly higher costs and lower product availability. For example, in the
fourth quarter of 1999, process control issues associated with WaferTech's
volume ramp up resulted in low die yields on FLEX 10KA and FLEX 10KE products
leading to reduced product availabilty in these families. As a result, we were
unable to support distributor stocking at desired levels and in some cases could
not meet end customer demand. Our management expects to continue to introduce
new and established products using new process technologies and may encounter
similar start-up difficulties during the transition to such process
technologies. Further, production throughput times vary considerably among our
wafer suppliers, and we may experience delays from time to time in processing
some of our products which also may result in higher costs and lower product
availability.

Research and Development

        Research and development expenses for the three months ended September
30, 2000 were $48.5 million, or 12.2% of sales, compared to $23.2 million, or
10.8% of sales, for the same period last year. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2000, excluding the $6.3 million one-time acquired in-process
research and development charge, research and development expenses were $121.8
million, or 12.1% percent of sales, compared to $60.1 million, or 10.0% of
sales, for the first nine months of 1999. Historically, the level of research
and development expenses as a percentage of sales has fluctuated in part due to
the timing of the purchase of masks and wafers used in development and
prototyping of new products. We expect that, in the long term, research and
development expenses will increase in absolute dollars primarily due to our
efforts to develop new products. Research and development expenses include
expenditures for labor, prototype and developmental wafers, the amortization of
deferred stock-based compensation, and expenses for the development of process
technology, new packages, and software to support new products and design
environments.



                                       11
<PAGE>   12


        Research and development expenses increased $25.3 million, or 109.1%,
for the three months ended September 30, 2000, and $61.7 million, or 102.7%, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2000, each over the same period last year.
The increases in absolute dollars were primarily a result of increased
headcount, additional spending on masks, wafers, package development and outside
development services relating to the development of new products including the
FLEX 10KE, MAX 7000B and APEX 20KE families, as well as development of our
Quartus software and Excalibur embedded processor solutions. During the second
quarter of 2000, we recorded deferred stock-based compensation of $41.3 million
for the acquisitions of DesignPRO and Right Track which is being amortized to
research and development expense over a period of two to four years.
Amortization of deferred stock-based compensation included in research and
development expenses was $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30,
2000, and $5.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000.

        We expect to continue to make significant investments in the development
of MAX 7000A/7000B, APEX 20K/20KE, Quartus software, Excalibur embedded
processor solutions and future products. During the first quarter of 1999, we
shipped APEX 20K, a new family of devices, and Quartus, our new fourth
generation software design tool. During the fourth quarter of 1999, we began
shipping our APEX 20KE family of devices. The rollout of the 1.8-volt APEX 20KE
product family progressed further during the second quarter of 2000, during
which time we began shipping four new devices including the APEX 20K1500E, one
of the world's largest programmable devices. The APEX 20KE family offers
advanced features over the APEX 20K family including lower power consumption,
faster performance, expanded I/O support and smaller die sizes. APEX 20K/20KE
devices utilize a new architecture for programmable logic and address higher
density designs. APEX 20K/20KE devices are supported exclusively by Quartus.
Also during the second quarter of 2000, we announced our new Excalibur embedded
processor solutions. Excalibur solutions combine programmable logic, memory and
a processor core, allowing users to integrate an entire system on a single
programmable logic device. These solutions provide programmable flexibility and
system-level integration while bringing advanced processor technology to the
broad marketplace. Our management expects APEX 20K/20KE devices, Quartus
software and Excalibur solutions to be successful in the marketplace, however,
the commercial success of these products depends on market acceptance of the use
of APEX 20K/20KE devices in high-density designs, as well as the acceptance of
the Quartus design software and Excalibur solutions. We cannot assure you that
any of our products will achieve market acceptance.

        We also continue to focus our efforts on the development of new
programmable logic chips, related development software and hardware, and
advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes. However, we cannot assure
you that we will accomplish our goals in the development and subsequent
introduction of new products and manufacturing processes. Also, we cannot assure
you that our new products will achieve market acceptance, that the new
manufacturing processes will be successful, or that our suppliers will provide
us with the quality and quantity of wafers and materials that we require. We
must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner to help
counter the semiconductor industry's historical trend of declining prices as
products mature.

Selling, General and Administrative

        Selling, general and administrative expenses were $57.3 million, or
14.5% of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2000 and $36.8 million,
or 17.0% of sales, for the three months ended September 30, 1999. Selling,
general and administrative expenses were $149.5 million, or 14.8% of sales, for
the nine months ended September 30, 2000 compared to $102.8 million, or 17.2% of
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1999. Although total selling,
general and administrative expenses increased, they decreased as a percentage of
sales because of strong revenue growth. Selling, general and administrative
expenses include salary expenses related to field sales, marketing and
administrative personnel, commissions and incentive expenses, advertising and
promotional expenditures, and legal expenses. Selling, general and
administrative expenses also include costs related to the direct sales force and
field application engineers who work in field sales offices worldwide and
stimulate demand by assisting customers in the use and proper selection of our
products.

        Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $20.5 million, or
55.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2000, and $46.7 million, or
45.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2000, each over the same period
last year. The increases in absolute dollars were mainly driven by increased
headcount for sales, marketing and administration personnel, higher advertising
expenses, and higher commission and incentive expenses associated with increased
sales.

                                       12
<PAGE>   13

In-Process Research and Development

        During the second quarter of 2000, we recorded a non-recurring charge of
$6.3 million to in-process research and development related to the purchase of
DesignPRO and Right Track. We determined this non-recurring charge using
valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high-technology
industry. We immediately expensed this non-recurring charge in the period of
acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no
alternative use had been identified. We discuss this charge in more detail in
Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Income from Operations

        Income from operations was $156.9 million, or 39.7% of sales, for the
three months ended September 30, 2000 compared to $78.4 million, or 36.5% of
sales, for the three months ended September 30, 1999, an increase of $78.5
million or 100.1%. Income from operations was $389.3 million, or 38.6% of sales,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 compared to $218.2 million, or
36.4% of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 1999, an increase of
$171.1 million or 78.4%. The year over year increase in operating income, as a
percentage of sales, was primarily due to improvements in gross margin partially
offset by increased research and development expenses as a percentage of sales.

Interest and Other Income, Net

        Interest and other income was $12.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2000 compared to $8.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 1999, an increase of $4.9 million or 61.3%. Interest and other income was
$33.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2000 compared to $18.6
million for the nine months ended September 30, 1999, an increase of $15.3
million or 82.3%. Interest and other income consists mainly of interest income
on investments in high quality fixed income securities. The increase in interest
and other income was primarily due to the increase in interest income related to
higher investment balances and higher interest rates.

Provision for Income Taxes

        Our effective tax rate was 31.0% for the nine months ended September 30,
2000 and 32.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 1999. The year over year
reduction of the effective tax rate primarily resulted from the reinstitution of
the research and development tax credit and a change in the geographic mix of
revenue.

Equity Investment

        In June 1996, we formed WaferTech, LLC, a joint venture company, with
TSMC and several other partners to build and operate a wafer manufacturing plant
in Camas, Washington. In return for a $140.4 million cash investment, we
received an 18% equity ownership in WaferTech and certain obligations and rights
to procure up to 27% of WaferTech's output at market prices. In January 1999, we
purchased from Analog Devices, Inc. an additional 5% equity ownership interest
in WaferTech for approximately $37.5 million, increasing our ownership interest
to 23%. This increased investment in WaferTech provides us with additional
obligations and rights to procure up to 35% of WaferTech's future output. In
October 1999, we made an additional $23.0 million cash investment in WaferTech.
Despite this additional cash investment, our ownership interest or obligations
and rights for the procurement of WaferTech's output did not change. We account
for our investment under the equity method based on our ability to exercise
significant influence over WaferTech's operating and financial policies. For the
three months ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a marginal profit in
WaferTech, as compared to a loss of $2.8 million for the same period a year ago.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, we recorded a marginal loss in
WaferTech, as compared to a loss of $6.2 million for the same period a year ago.
In past quarters, WaferTech had experienced lower than forecast production
yields resulting in lower than forecast output. During the three months ended
September 30, 2000, WaferTech's production volumes and yields increased over
prior periods and met our targeted levels. We cannot assure you that WaferTech
will continue to make a profit or that WaferTech will not have an adverse impact
on our operating results.

Future Results

        Our industry is intensely competitive. Future operating results will
depend on our ability to develop, manufacture and sell complex semiconductor
components and programming software that offer customers greater value than
solutions offered by competing vendors. We may not succeed in developing,
manufacturing or selling competitive products. We are developing programmable
chips for applications that are presently served by other ASIC vendors. Many of
these vendors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing
resources than we do and have well-established market positions and a solution
that has been proven technically feasible and economically competitive over
several decades. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in displacing
ASIC vendors in the targeted applications and densities. Furthermore, other
programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be
successful in securing market share from us. Moreover, our customers
increasingly use standard cell technologies to achieve greater integration in
their systems; this may not only impede our efforts to penetrate the ASIC
market, but may also displace our products in the applications that we presently
serve.

        As a semiconductor company, we operate in a dynamic market characterized
by rapid product obsolescence. We continue to focus our efforts on developing
new programmable logic chips, related development software and hardware and
advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication processes. We cannot assure you that we
will be able to continue to develop and introduce new products and manufacturing
proceeses or that our products and processes will achieve market acceptance or
be successful. If we do not successfully define, develop and introduce
competitive new products and enhance existing products in response to both
evolving demands of the market place and competitive product offerings, our
future operating results would be adversely affected.

        We own numerous patents and patent applications and have technology
licensing agreements giving us rights to design, manufacture and package
products using certain patents owned by others. We cannot assure you that our
intellectual property rights will provide meaningful protection from competition
or that we will rely on such rights in developing additional products. We may be
unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face
significant future litigation expenses.

        We depend significantly upon subcontractors to manufacture silicon
wafers and assemble, test and ship product to end customers. We also depend on
all of our subcontractors, and especially our principal foundry partner, TSMC,
to improve process technologies in a timely manner to enhance our product
designs and cost structure. Our success depends, in part, on TSMC's ability to
remain successful in its highly competitive industry. Their inability to do so
could have a severe negative impact on us. The vast majority of our products are
manufactured and shipped to customers by subcontractors located in Asia,
principally Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan.
Disruptions or adverse supply conditions arising from market conditions,
political strife, labor disruptions and other factors could adversely affect our
future results. Market demand for silicon wafers increased significantly during
the course of 1999 and through the third quarter of 2000, while supply of such
wafers has increased at a much slower rate. This has resulted in a firmer
pricing environment, less responsiveness to requests for expedited delivery by
wafer suppliers, and in some cases, unsatisfied demand. In general, the lead
time to increase market wafer supply by building additional wafer fabrication
facilities is approximately two years and in periods where demand for wafers
increases rapidly for a prolonged period, market shortages tend to occur. Our
management believes that for at least the next several quarters, demand will
exceed the foundry industry's ability to supply silicon wafers and that certain
companies that rely on the foundry industry will not succeed in securing all of
the wafers that they desire, thereby constraining their revenues. We believe
that under such circumstances it is important to have close business
relationships with wafer suppliers in order to receive the desired quantity of
product. We believe that we enjoy close working relationships with our principal
wafer supplier, TSMC. However, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in
securing our total desired output from TSMC or that the scarcity of silicon
wafers will not impair or prevent any future growth of our business.

        Natural or man-made disasters, normal process fluctuations and variances
in manufacturing yields could have a severe negative impact on our operating
capabilities. For example, in September 1999, a major earthquake struck Taiwan
resulting in widespread physical damage and loss of life. The earthquake halted
wafer fabrication production at our primary vendor, TSMC, for several days and
then only limited production began. Nearly two weeks passed before full
production resumed, and a portion of the inventory in the production process was
scrapped as a result of damage incurred during the earthquake. We have sought to
diversify our operating risk by obtaining silicon wafers from WaferTech.
WaferTech began production of silicon wafers in October 1998 and achieved volume
production in 1999. In past quarters, WaferTech had experienced lower than
forecast production yields resulting in lower than forecast output. During the
three months ended September 30, 2000, WaferTech's production volumes and yields
increased over prior periods and met our targeted levels.

We cannot assure you that the worldwide supply and demand for semiconductor
wafers will be such that WaferTech will continue to make a profit or that
WaferTech will not have an adverse impact on our operating results.

        A number of factors outside of our control, including general economic
conditions and cycles in world markets, exchange rate fluctuations or a lack of
growth in our end markets could also adversely impact future results. The
semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically been subject to
significant downturns as a result of diminished demand, general reductions in
inventory levels by customers, excess production capacity and accelerated
declines in average selling prices. Because of these and other factors that
might affect our operating results, you should not consider our past financial
performance as an indicator of our future performance, and you should not use
historical trends to anticipate our future results. In addition, the price of
our common stock has fluctuated significantly due to the cyclical nature of the
semiconductor industry and other factors.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

        During the first nine months of 2000, cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments increased by $177.1 million to $1,022.8 million from
$845.7 million at December 31, 1999. During the first nine months of 2000, our
operating activities generated net cash of $407.6 million. This cash flow was
primarily attributable to net income of $291.4 million, adjusted by non-cash
items including an increase in deferred income on sales to distributors of
$138.4 million, an increase of income taxes payable of $110.9 million, an
increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $64.1 million,
depreciation and amortization of $28.5 million, the one-time write-off of $6.3
million for acquired in-process research and development and amortization of
deferred stock-based compensation of $5.3 million. These items were partially
offset by increases in inventories of $114.8 million, accounts receivable of
$80.6 million and deferred income taxes of $53.9 million.

        Cash used for investing activities of $125.8 million for the first nine
months of 2000 was primarily the result of net purchases of short-term
investments of $44.6 million, cash payments of $11.5 million for the
acquisitions of DesignPRO and Right Track, as well as our $67.7 million
investment in land, manufacturing and data processing equipment and software,
and building improvements in our headquarter facility.

        For the first nine months of 2000, we used $149.3 million in net cash
for financing activities. We repurchased 4.8 million shares of our common stock
for $187.4 million, partially offset by net proceeds of $31.1 million from the
issuance of 7.1 million shares of common stock to employees through various
option and employee stock purchase plans. In addition, we received $7.0 million
from the sale of put warrants.

Financial Condition

        Since our inception, we have used a combination of equity and debt
financing and cash generated from operations to support our operating
activities.

        As of September 30, 2000, we had $1,022.8 million of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments available to finance our operating
activities and future growth. We believe the available sources of funds and cash
we expect to generate from operations will be adequate to finance current
operations, capital expenditures and common stock repurchases for at least the
next year.

Impact of Currency and Inflation

        We purchase the majority of our materials and services in U.S. dollars,
and transact our foreign sales in U.S. dollars. We have, in the past, entered
into forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations and to meet
contractual commitments denominated in foreign currencies. During the second
quarter of 2000, we entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase
Malaysian ringgit to meet a portion of our firm contractual commitments of
ringgit required. The contract will be settled in June 2001. We may enter into
similar contracts from time to time should conditions appear favorable.
Inflation has not significantly impacted our financial results.

ITEM 3: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

        Our investment portfolio consisted of fixed income securities of $919.9
million as of September 30, 2000 and $710.3 million as of September 30, 1999.
These securities, like all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest
rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market
interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 10% from levels as
of September 30, 2000 and September 30, 1999, the decline in the fair value of
the portfolio would not be material. Additionally, we have the ability to hold
our fixed income investments until maturity and, therefore, we would not expect
to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows.

        We have international subsidiaries and branch operations and are,
therefore, subject to foreign currency rate exposure. To date, our exposure to
exchange rate volatility has not been significant. If the foreign currency rates
fluctuate by 10% from rates at September 30, 2000 and September 30, 1999, our
financial position and results of operations would not be materially affected.
However, we cannot assure you there will not be a material impact in the future.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION


ITEM 1: Legal Proceedings

        We are a party to lawsuits and may in the future become a party to
lawsuits involving various types of claims, including, but not limited to,
unfair competition and intellectual property matters. Legal proceedings tend to
be unpredictable and costly and may be affected by events outside of our
control. We cannot assure you that litigation will not have an adverse effect on
our financial position or results of operations. Our major litigation matters as
of September 30, 2000 are described below.

        In June 1993, Xilinx, Inc. sued us for monetary damages and injunctive
relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents held by Xilinx. In
June 1993, we sued Xilinx for monetary damages and injunctive relief based on
Xilinx's alleged infringement of certain patents held by us. In April 1995, we
filed a separate lawsuit against Xilinx in Delaware, Xilinx's state of
incorporation, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on Xilinx's
alleged infringement of one of our patents. In May 1995, Xilinx counter-claimed
against us in Delaware, asserting defenses and seeking monetary damages and
injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of certain patents held by
Xilinx. Subsequently, the Delaware case was transferred to California. In
October 1998, both parties filed motions for summary judgment with respect to
certain issues in the first two cases regarding infringement or non-infringement
and validity or invalidity of the patents at issue in the respective cases. In
October 1999 - December 1999, the court ruled on the motions. In the Xilinx
suit, the court ruled that one of Xilinx's claims is invalid and another claim
was withdrawn. The court also ruled that issues of infringement and validity on
the remaining claims were subject to trial which began October 5, 2000 and is
scheduled to be completed in November 2000. In our suit, the court granted that
one of our patents is invalid, granted that one patent is not infringed, and
granted another patent is not literally infringed but denied non-infringement
under the doctrine of equivalence. In October 2000, Xilinx withdrew its claims
against our MAX 5000, MAX 7000 and MAX 9000 family products. Court ordered
mediation which began February 24, 2000 did not reach a settlement and has been
terminated. Due to the nature of the litigation with Xilinx and because the
lawsuits are in the liability trial stage, our management cannot estimate the
total expense, the possible loss, if any, or the range of loss that we may
ultimately incur in connection with the allegations. Our management cannot
ensure that Xilinx will not succeed in obtaining significant monetary damages or
an injunction against the manufacture and sale of our products, including but
not limited to our FLEX 8000 family products, or succeed in invalidating our
other patents. Although we cannot make any assurances as to the results of these
cases, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims asserted in
the Xilinx suit and intend to pursue our claims and defend ourselves vigorously
in this matter.

        In May 2000, we sued Xilinx, seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief based on Xilinx's alleged infringement of certain patents held by us. In
July 2000, Xilinx filed a counterclaim against us alleging infringement of
certain patents held by Xilinx. The court has issued an order setting the claim
construction hearing for December 6 and 7, 2000. Due to the nature of the
litigation with Xilinx and because the lawsuit is still in the pre-trial stage,
our management cannot estimate the total expenses, the possible loss, if any, or
the range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the
counterclaim allegations. Although we cannot make any assurances as to the
results of this case, we believe that we have meritorious defenses to Xilinx'
counterclaim and intend to pursue our claims and defend ourselves vigorously in
this matter.

        In August 1994, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., or AMD, sued us seeking
monetary damages and injunctive relief based on our alleged infringement of
certain patents held by AMD. In September 1994, we answered the complaint
asserting that we are licensed to use the patents which AMD claims are infringed
and filed a counterclaim against AMD alleging infringement of certain patents
held by us. In October 1997, upon completion of trials bifurcated from the
infringement claims, the District Court ruled that we are licensed under all
patents asserted by AMD in the suit. In December 1997, AMD filed a Notice of
Appeal of the District Court's rulings. In April 1999, the Federal Circuit Court
ruled in AMD's favor on its appeal, finding that we are not licensed to AMD's
patents, and remanded the case back to the District Court for further
proceedings. In 1999, Lattice Corporation entered into an agreement with AMD
which includes assuming both the claims against us and the claims against AMD
and has replaced AMD in the suit with Vantis, a wholly owned subsidiary of
Lattice. Due to the nature of the litigation, our management cannot estimate the
total expense, the possible loss, if any, or the range of loss that may
ultimately be incurred in connection with the allegations. We cannot ensure that
Lattice will not succeed in obtaining significant monetary damages or an
injunction against the manufacture and sale of the Classic, MAX 7000, FLEX 8000,
MAX 9000 and FLEX 10K product families, or succeed in


                                       17
<PAGE>   18


invalidating any of our patents remaining in the suit. Although we cannot make
any assurances as to the results of this case, we intend to pursue our claims
and defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.

        In May 2000, we sued Lattice seeking monetary damages and injunctive
relief based on Lattice's alleged infringement of certain patents held by us. In
July 2000, Lattice filed a counterclaim against us alleging infringement of
certain patents held by Lattice. Due to the nature of the litigation with
Lattice and because the lawsuit is still in the pre-trial stage, our management
cannot estimate the total expenses, the possible loss, if any, or the range of
loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the counterclaim
allegations. Although we cannot make any assurances as to the results of this
case, we intend to pursue our claims and defend ourselves vigorously in this
matter.

        In November 1999, we sued Clear Logic Inc. alleging that Clear Logic is
unlawfully appropriating our registered mask work technology in violation of the
federal mask work statute and that Clear Logic has unlawfully interfered with
our relationships and contracts with our customers. The lawsuit seeks
compensatory and punitive damages and an injunction to stop Clear Logic from
unlawfully using our mask work technology and from interfering with our
customers. Clear Logic has answered the complaint by denying that it is
infringing our mask work technology and denying that it has unlawfully
interfered with our relationships and contracts with our customers. Clear Logic
has also filed a counterclaim against us for unfair competition under California
law alleging that we have made false statements to our customers regarding Clear
Logic. Due to the nature of the litigation with Clear Logic and because the
lawsuit is still in the pre-trial stage, our management cannot estimate the
total expenses, the possible loss, if any, or the range of loss that may
ultimately be incurred in connection with the counterclaim allegations. Although
we cannot make any assurances as to the results of this case, we intend to
pursue our claims and defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.


ITEM 2: Changes in Securities and Use of Proceeds

        As part of the consideration for our acquisition of all outstanding
capital stock of Northwest Logic, Inc. on September 11, 2000, we issued 48,727
shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Northwest Logic. In
addition, as part of an employment package we granted former employees of
Northwest Logic options to purchase 153,945 shares of our common stock. The
options vest in 25% increments over four years and have a ten-year term. We
issued these shares and granted these options in a private placement in reliance
upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

        determined by the Administrator to be the primary market for the Common
        Stock or the Nasdaq National Market, whichever is applicable or (B) if
        the Common Stock is not traded on any such exchange or national market
        system, the average of the high bid and low asked prices of a Share on

        determination (or, if no such prices were reported on that date, on the
        last date on which such prices were reported), in each case, as reported
        in The Wall Street Journal or such other source as the Administrator
        deems reliable; or

under the Plan pursuant to an Option shall not be returned to the Plan and shall
not become available for future issuance under the Plan.

        4. Administration of the Plan.

                        (i) Administration with Respect to Directors and
        Officers. With respect to grants of Options to Employees who are also
        Officers or Directors of the Company, the Plan shall be administered by
        (A) the Board or (B) a Committee designated by the Board, which
        Committee shall be constituted in such a manner as to satisfy the
        Applicable Laws and to permit such grants and related transactions under
        the Plan to be exempt from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act in

        the Board.



                                       3
<PAGE>   4

                        (ii) Administration With Respect to Other Employees.
        With respect to grants of Options to Employees who are neither Directors
        nor Officers of the Company, the Plan shall be administered by (A) the
        Board or (B) a Committee designated by the Board, which Committee shall
        be constituted in such a manner as to satisfy the Applicable Laws. Once
        appointed, such Committee shall continue to serve in its designated
        capacity until otherwise directed by the Board. The Board may authorize
        one or more Officers to grant such Options and may limit such authority
        as the Board determines from time to time.

                        (iii) Administration Errors. If an Option is granted in
        a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection (a), such
        Option shall be presumptively valid as of its grant date to the extent
        permitted by the Applicable Laws.

                (b) Powers of the Administrator. Subject to Applicable Laws and
the provisions of the Plan (including any other powers given to the
Administrator hereunder), and except as otherwise provided by the Board, the
Administrator shall have the authority, in its discretion:

                        (i) to select the Employees to whom Options may be
        granted from time to time hereunder;

                        (ii) to determine whether and to what extent Options are
        granted hereunder;

                        (iii) to determine the number of Shares or the amount of
        other consideration to be covered by each Option granted hereunder;

                        (iv) to approve forms of Option Agreements for use under
        the Plan;

                        (v) to determine the terms and conditions of any Option
        granted hereunder;

                        (vi) to amend the terms of any outstanding Option
        granted under the Plan, provided that any amendment that would adversely
        affect the Grantee's rights under an outstanding Option shall not be
        made without the Grantee's written consent;

                        (vii) to construe and interpret the terms of the Plan
        and Options granted pursuant to the Plan, including without limitation,
        any notice of Option or Option Agreement, granted pursuant to the Plan;

                        (viii) to establish additional terms, conditions, rules
        or procedures to accommodate the rules or laws of applicable foreign
        jurisdictions and to afford Grantees favorable treatment under such
        laws; provided, however, that no Option shall be granted under any such
        additional terms, conditions, rules or procedures with terms or
        conditions which are inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan; and

                        (ix) to take such other action, not inconsistent with
        the terms of the Plan, as the Administrator deems appropriate.

        5. Eligibility. Options may be granted to Employees.



                                       4
<PAGE>   5

        6. Terms and Conditions of Options.

                (a) Conditions of Option. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the
Administrator shall determine the provisions, terms, and conditions of each
Option including, but not limited to, the Option vesting schedule, repurchase
provisions, rights of first refusal, forfeiture provisions, form of payment
(cash, Shares, or other consideration) upon settlement of the Option, payment
contingencies, and satisfaction of any performance criteria. The performance
criteria established by the Administrator may be based on any one of, or
combination of, increase in share price, earnings per share, total stockholder
return, return on equity, return on assets, return on investment, net operating
income, cash flow, revenue, economic value added, personal management
objectives, or other measure of performance selected by the Administrator.
Partial achievement of the specified criteria may result in a payment or vesting
corresponding to the degree of achievement as specified in the Option Agreement.

                (b) Acquisitions and Other Transactions. The Administrator may
issue Options under the Plan in settlement, assumption or substitution for,
outstanding Options or obligations to grant future Options in connection with
the Company or a Related Entity acquiring another entity, an interest in another
entity or an additional interest in a Related Entity whether by merger, stock
purchase, asset purchase or other form of transaction.

                (c) Deferral of Option Payment. The Administrator may establish
one or more programs under the Plan to permit selected Grantees the opportunity
to elect to defer receipt of consideration upon exercise of an Option,
satisfaction of performance criteria, or other event that absent the election
would entitle the Grantee to payment or receipt of Shares or other consideration
under an Option. The Administrator may establish the election procedures, the
timing of such elections, the mechanisms for payments of, and accrual of
interest or other earnings, if any, on amounts, Shares or other consideration so
deferred, and such other terms, conditions, rules and procedures that the
Administrator deems advisable for the administration of any such deferral
program.

                (d) Separate Programs. The Administrator may establish one or
more separate programs under the Plan for the purpose of issuing particular
forms of Options to one or more classes of Grantees on such terms and conditions
as determined by the Administrator from time to time.

                (e) Buyout Provisions. The Administrator may at any time offer
to buy out for a payment in cash or Shares, an Option previously granted based
on such terms and conditions as the Administrator shall establish and
communicate to the Grantee at the time that such offer is made.

                (f) Early Exercise. The Option Agreement may, but need not,
include a provision whereby the Grantee may elect at any time while an Employee
to exercise any part or all of the Option prior to full vesting of the Option.
Any unvested Shares received pursuant to such exercise may be subject to a
repurchase right in favor of the Company or a Related Entity or to any other
restriction the Administrator determines to be appropriate.

                (g) Term of Option. The term of each Option shall be the term
stated in the Option Agreement.

                (h) Transferability of Options. Options may be transferred by
will and by the laws of descent and distribution or during the Grantee's
lifetime through a domestic relations order to the extent provided in the Option
Agreement or in the manner and to the extent determined by the Administrator.



                                       5
<PAGE>   6

                (i) Time of Granting Options. The date of grant of an Option
shall for all purposes be the date on which the Administrator makes the
determination to grant such Option, or such other date as is determined by the
Administrator. Notice of the grant determination shall be given to each Employee
to whom an Option is so granted within a reasonable time after the date of such
grant.

        7. Option Exercise or Purchase Price, Consideration and Taxes.

                (a) Exercise or Purchase Price. The exercise or purchase price,
if any, for an Option shall be the price determined by the Administrator.

                (b) Consideration. Subject to Applicable Laws, the consideration
to be paid for the Shares to be issued upon exercise or purchase of an Option
including the method of payment, shall be determined by the Administrator. In
addition to any other types of consideration the Administrator may determine,
the Administrator is authorized to accept as consideration for Shares issued
under the Plan the following, provided that the portion of the consideration
equal to the par value of the Shares must be paid in cash or other legal
consideration permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law:

                        (i) cash;

                        (ii) check;

                        (iii) surrender of Shares or delivery of a properly
        executed form of attestation of ownership of Shares as the Administrator
        may require (including withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable upon
        exercise of the Option) which have a Fair Market Value on the date of
        surrender or attestation equal to the aggregate exercise price of the
        Shares as to which said Option shall be exercised (but only to the
        extent that such exercise of the Option would not result in an
        accounting compensation charge with respect to the Shares used to pay
        the exercise price unless otherwise determined by the Administrator);

                        (iv) payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance
        procedure pursuant to which the Grantee (A) shall provide written
        instructions to a Company designated brokerage firm to effect the
        immediate sale of some or all of the purchased Shares and remit to the
        Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement date,
        sufficient funds to cover the aggregate exercise price payable for the
        purchased Shares and (B) shall provide written directives to the Company
        to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares directly to such
        brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction;

                        (v) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability
        to the Grantee, including any liability attributable to the Grantee's
        participation in any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or
        arrangement; or

                        (vi) any combination of the foregoing methods of
        payment.

                (c) Taxes. No Shares shall be delivered under the Plan to any
Grantee or other person until such Grantee or other person has made arrangements
acceptable to the Administrator for the satisfaction of any foreign, federal,
state, or local income and employment tax withholding obligations, including,
without limitation, obligations incident to the receipt of Shares. Upon exercise
of an Option, the Company shall withhold or collect from Grantee an amount
sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations.

        8. Exercise of Option.

                (a) Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Stockholder.

                        (i) Any Option granted hereunder shall be exercisable at
        such times and under such conditions as determined by the Administrator
        under the terms of the Plan and specified in the Option Agreement. No
        Option may be exercised for a fraction of a Share.

                        (ii) An Option shall be deemed to be exercised when (1)
        notice of such exercise has been given to the Company or its authorized
        representative in accordance with the terms of the Option by the person
        entitled to exercise the Option and (2)(a) full payment for the Shares
        with respect to which the Option is exercised has been received by the
        Company or (b) the Shares have been sold as a result of the use of the
        broker-dealer sale and remittance procedure to pay the purchase price as
        provided in Section 7(b)(iv). Until the issuance (as evidenced by the
        appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized
        transfer agent of the Company) of the stock certificate evidencing such
        Shares, no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a
        stockholder shall exist with respect to Shares subject to an Option,
        notwithstanding the exercise of an Option or other Option. The Company
        shall issue (or cause to be issued) such stock certificate promptly upon
        exercise of the Option. No adjustment will be made for a dividend or
        other right for which the record date is prior to the date the stock
        certificate is issued, except as provided in the Option Agreement or
        Section 10 below.

                (b) Exercise of Option Following Termination of Continuous
Service.

                        (i) An Option may not be exercised after the termination
        date of such Option set forth in the Option Agreement and may be
        exercised following the termination of a Grantee's Continuous Service
        only to the extent provided in the Option Agreement.

                        (ii) Where the Option Agreement permits a Grantee to
        exercise an Option following the termination of the Grantee's Continuous
        Service for a specified period, the Option shall terminate to the extent
        not exercised on the last day of the specified period or the last day of
        the original term of the Option, whichever occurs first.

        9. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares.

                (a) Shares shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an
Option unless the exercise of such Option and the issuance and delivery of such
Shares pursuant thereto shall comply with all Applicable Laws, and shall be
further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such
compliance.

                (b) As a condition to the exercise of an Option, the Company may
require the person exercising such Option to represent and warrant at the time
of any such exercise that the Shares are being purchased only for investment and
without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares if, in the
opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any
Applicable Laws.

        10. Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization. Subject to any required
action by the stockholders of the Company, the number of Shares covered by each
outstanding Option, and the number of Shares which have been authorized for
issuance under the Plan but as to which no Options have yet been granted, the
exercise or purchase price of each such outstanding Option, as well as any other
terms



                                       7
<PAGE>   8

that the Administrator determines require adjustment shall be proportionately
adjusted for (i) any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares
resulting from a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, combination
or reclassification of the Shares, or similar event affecting the Shares, (ii)
any other increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares effected without
receipt of consideration by the Company, or (iii) as the Administrator may
determine in its discretion, any other transaction with respect to Common Stock
to which Section 424(a) of the Code applies or any similar transaction;
provided, however that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company
shall not be deemed to have been "effected without receipt of consideration."
Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator and its determination shall
be final, binding and conclusive. Except as the Administrator determines, no
issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities
convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment
by reason hereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of Shares
subject to an Option.

        11. Dissolution or Liquidation; Corporate Transaction.

                (a) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed
dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator shall notify each
Grantee as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed
transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for Grantee to have
the right to exercise his or her Option prior to such transaction as to all of
the Shares covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Option would not
otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any
Company repurchase option applicable to any Shares purchased upon exercise of an
Option shall lapse as to all such Shares, provided the proposed dissolution or
liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the
extent it has not been previously exercised, an Option will terminate
immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.

                (b) Corporate Transaction. In the event of a Corporate
Transaction, each Option which is at the time outstanding under the Plan shall
automatically become fully vested and exercisable and be released from any
restrictions on transfer and repurchase or forfeiture rights, immediately prior
to the specified effective date of such Corporate Transaction, for all of the
Shares at the time represented by such Option if the Option is not assumed by
the successor corporation or the Parent thereof in connection with the Corporate
Transaction. For the purposes of accelerating the vesting and the release of
restrictions applicable to Options pursuant to this subsection (but not for
purposes of termination of such Options), the Option shall be considered assumed
if, in connection with the Corporate Transaction, the option or right confers
the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Option
immediately prior to the Corporate Transaction, the consideration (whether
stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the Corporate
Transaction by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date
of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the
type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Shares) under vesting and terms that give effect to the vesting and terms of the
Options surrendered; provided, however, that if such consideration received in
the Corporate Transaction was not solely common stock of the successor
corporation or its Parent, the Administrator may, with the consent of the
successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the
exercise of the Option, for each Share of Optioned Stock subject to the Option,
to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or its Parent equal in
fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common
Stock in the Corporate Transaction. The determination of Option comparability
above shall be made by the Administrator and its determination shall be final,
binding and conclusive. Effective upon the consummation of the Corporate
Transaction, all outstanding Options under the Plan shall terminate. However,
all such Options shall not terminate if the Options are, in connection with the
Corporate Transaction, assumed by the successor corporation or Parent thereof.



                                       8
<PAGE>   9

        12. Effective Date and Term of Plan. The Plan shall become effective
upon the adoption by the Board of the Company. It shall continue in effect for a
term of ten (10) years unless sooner terminated. Subject to Applicable Laws,
Options may be granted under the Plan upon its becoming effective.

        13. Amendment, Suspension or Termination of the Plan.

                (a) The Board may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the
Plan. To the extent necessary to comply with Applicable Laws, the Company shall
obtain stockholder approval of any Plan amendment in such a manner and to such a
degree as required.

                (b) No Option may be granted during any suspension of the Plan
or after termination of the Plan.

                (c) Any amendment, suspension or termination of the Plan
(including termination of the Plan under Section 12 above) shall not affect
Options already granted, and such Options shall remain in full force and effect
as if the Plan had not been amended, suspended or terminated, unless mutually
agreed otherwise between the Grantee and the Administrator, which agreement must
be in writing and signed by the Grantee and the Company.

        14. Reservation of Shares.

                (a) The Company, during the term of the Plan, will at all times
reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to
satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

                (b) The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any
regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's
counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder,
shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or
sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been
obtained.

        15. No Effect on Terms of Employment. The Plan shall not confer upon any
Grantee any right with respect to the Grantee's Continuous Service, nor shall it
interfere in any way with his or her right or the Company's right to terminate
the Grantee's Continuous Service at any time, for any reason.

        16. No Effect on Retirement and Other Benefit Plans. Except as
specifically provided in a retirement or other benefit plan of the Company or a
Related Entity, Options shall not be deemed compensation for purposes of
computing benefits or contributions under any retirement plan of the Company or
a Related Entity, and shall not affect any benefits under any other benefit plan
of any kind or any benefit plan subsequently instituted under which the
availability or amount of benefits is related to level of compensation. The Plan
is not a "Retirement Plan" or "Welfare Plan" under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.

Definitions:

        As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

        "Adjusted Termination Date" shall be determined by adding ________ days
to the date of termination of Grantee's Continuous Service and subtracting the
number of days of any Vesting Suspension Periods.

        "Cause" shall be deemed to exist if, in the reasonable judgment of the
Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Grantee: (i) commits fraud, theft or
embezzlement of a type that would be subject to prosecution under Federal or
Oregon law, against the Company or any Related Entity, and there is clear and
convincing evidence that such fraud, theft, or embezzlement occurred; (ii) is
convicted for having committed a serious felony, and such conviction has a
significant adverse effect on the affairs or business of the Company; (iii)
compromises or attempts to compromise material trade secrets or other
proprietary information of the Company and such action materially damages the
Company, or in the event of an unsuccessful attempt, would likely have caused
material damage to the Company if successful; (iv) materially breaches any
non-competition or non-solicitation agreement with the Company or any Related
Entity; (v) fails
<PAGE>   2

to devote such business time and effort necessary to adequately and properly
discharge his or her duties to the Company or any Related Entity or engages in
outside activities that substantially interfere with such efforts; or (vi)
engages in any grossly negligent act or willful misconduct in the scope of his
or her duties to the Company or any Related Entity. During any criminal
prosecution covered by subsection (ii) above, the vesting of Shares subject to
the Option shall be suspended. If the prosecution does not result in a
conviction, the Grantee shall receive credit toward vesting for the period of
the prosecution as if the prosecution had not occurred.

        "Vesting Suspension Period" means the period or periods during which the
vesting of Grantee's Options has ceased pursuant to clause (b) under "Vesting
Schedule" below.

Vesting Schedule:

        (a) Subject to Grantee's Continuous Service and other limitations set
forth in this Notice, the Plan and the Option Agreement, the Option may be
exercised, in whole or in part, in accordance with the following schedule: 25%
of the Shares subject to the Option shall vest twelve months after the Vesting
Commencement Date, and an additional 25% of the Shares subject to the Option
shall vest on each yearly anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date
thereafter.

        (b) During any Approved Leave of Absence, the vesting of the Option as
provided in this schedule shall cease after the Approved Leave of Absence
exceeds a period of ninety (90) days. Vesting of the Option shall resume upon
the Grantee's termination of the Approved Leave of Absence and return to
Continuous Service to the Company or a Related Entity. The vesting schedule set
forth in (a) above shall be adjusted in the event that vesting temporarily
ceases pursuant to this paragraph.

        (c) In the event of termination of the Grantee's Continuous Service by
the Company or a Related Entity without Cause, that portion of such Grantee's
unvested Shares subject to the Option that would have vested as of the Adjusted
Termination Date shall fully vest immediately upon termination of such
Continuous Service.

        (d) If the Grantee's Continuous Service ceases for any reason other than
termination by the Company or a Related Entity without Cause, vesting of the
Shares subject to the Option shall immediately cease.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Grantee have executed this
Notice and agree that the Option is to be governed by the terms and conditions
of this Notice, the Plan, and the Option Agreement.

          ALTERA CORPORATION 2000 NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION PLAN NO. 1

                   NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION AWARD AGREEMENT

        1. Grant of Option. Altera Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), hereby grants to the Grantee (the "Grantee") named in the Notice of
Non-Qualified Stock Option Grant (the "Notice"), an option (the "Option") to
purchase the Total Number of Shares of Common Stock subject to the Option (the
"Shares") set forth in the Notice, at the Exercise Price per Share set forth in
the Notice (the "Exercise Price") subject to the terms and provisions of the
Notice, this Non-Qualified Stock Option Award Agreement (the "Option Agreement")
and the Company's 2000 Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan No. 1, as amended from
time to time (the "Plan"), which are incorporated herein by reference. Unless
otherwise defined herein, the terms defined in the Plan shall have the same
defined meanings in this Option Agreement.

        2. Exercise of Option.

                (a) Right to Exercise. The Option shall be exercisable during
its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice and with
the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. The Option
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 11 of the Plan relating to the
exercisability or termination of the Option in the event of a Corporate
Transaction. In no event shall the Company issue fractional Shares.

                (b) Method of Exercise. The Option shall be exercisable only by
delivery to the Company or its authorized representative of an exercise notice
in the form approved by the Administrator and in effect at the time of exercise
by such method as determined from time to time by the Administrator accompanied
by payment of the Exercise Price.

                (c) Taxes. No Shares will be delivered to the Grantee or other
person pursuant to the exercise of the Option until the Grantee or other person
has made arrangements acceptable to the Administrator for the satisfaction of
applicable income tax, employment tax, and social security tax withholding
obligations, including, without limitation, obligations incident to the receipt
of Shares. Upon exercise of the Option, the Company or the Grantee's employer
may offset or withhold (from any amount owed by the Company or the Grantee's
employer to the Grantee) or collect from the Grantee or other person an amount
sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations and/or the employer's withholding
obligations.

        3. Method of Payment. Payment of the Exercise Price shall be by any of
the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Grantee;
provided, however, that such exercise method does not then violate any
Applicable Law and, provided further, that the portion of the Exercise Price
equal to the par value of the Shares must be paid in cash or other legal
consideration permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law:

                (a) cash;

                (b) check;
<PAGE>   5

                (c) surrender of shares of Common Stock or delivery of a
properly executed form of attestation of ownership of shares of Common Stock as
the Administrator may require (including withholding of Shares otherwise
deliverable upon exercise of the Option) which have a Fair Market Value on the
date of surrender or attestation equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the
Shares as to which the Option is being exercised (but only to the extent that
such exercise of the Option would not result in an accounting compensation
charge with respect to the shares of Common Stock used to pay the exercise
price);

                (d) payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance
procedure pursuant to which the Grantee (i) shall provide written instructions
to a Company designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of some or
all of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds
available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate
exercise price payable for the purchased Shares and (ii) shall provide written
directives to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares
directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction;

                (e) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the
Grantee, including any liability attributable to the Grantee's participation in
any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement; or

                (f) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

        4. Restrictions on Exercise. The Option may not be exercised if the
issuance of the Shares subject to the Option upon such exercise would constitute
a violation of any Applicable Laws.

        5. Termination or Change of Continuous Service. If Grantee's Continuous
Service is terminated by the Company or a Related Entity without Cause the
Grantee may, to the extent otherwise so entitled at the date of such termination
(the "Termination Date"), exercise the Option, but only within sixty (60) days
of such Termination Date. If Grantee's Continuous Service is terminated for any
other reason (other than for Disability or death, which is governed by Section 6
below), the Grantee may, to the extent otherwise so entitled at the Termination
Date, exercise the Option, but only within thirty (30) days of such Termination
Date. In no event shall the Option be exercised later than the Expiration Date
set forth in the Notice. Except as provided in Section 6 below, to the extent
that the Grantee is not entitled to exercise the Option on the Termination Date,
or if the Grantee does not exercise the Option within the time specified herein,
the Option shall terminate.

        6. Disability or Death of Grantee. If the Grantee's Continuous Service
terminates as a result of his or her Disability or death, this Option may be
exercised, but only within six (6) months from the Termination Date (and in no
event later than the Expiration Date), and only to the extent the Grantee was
otherwise entitled to exercise it on the Termination Date. To the extent that
the Grantee is not entitled to exercise the Option on the Termination Date, or
if the Option is not exercised to the extent so entitled to be within the time
specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
<PAGE>   6

        7. Transferability of Option. The Option may be transferred to any
person by will and by the laws of descent and distribution or during the
lifetime of the Grantee pursuant to a domestic relations order to the extent and
in the manner determined by the Administrator. The terms of the Option shall be
binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of
the Grantee.

        8. Term of Option. The Option may be exercised no later than the
Expiration Date set forth in the Notice or such earlier date as otherwise
provided herein.

        9. Tax Consequences. THE COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO
THE GRANTEE AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF VESTING OR EXERCISE OF AN OPTION AND
DISPOSITION OF THE SHARES. ACCORDINGLY, THE GRANTEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER
REGARDING VESTING OR EXERCISING OF THE OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.

        10. Entire Agreement: Governing Law. The Notice, the Plan and this
Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings
and agreements of the Company and the Grantee with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Grantee's interest except by
means of a writing signed by the Company and the Grantee. Nothing in the Notice,
the Plan and this Option Agreement (except as expressly provided therein) is
intended to confer any rights or remedies on any persons other than the parties.
The Notice, the Plan and this Option Agreement are to be construed in accordance
with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of Delaware to the
rights and duties of the parties. Should any provision of the Notice, the Plan
or this Option Agreement be determined by a court of law to be illegal or
unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by
law and the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall
remain enforceable.

        11. Headings. The captions used in the Notice and this Option Agreement
are inserted for convenience and shall not be deemed a part of the Option for
construction or interpretation.

        12. Dispute Resolution The provisions of this Section 12 shall be the
exclusive means of resolving disputes arising out of or relating to the Notice,
the Plan and this Option Agreement. The Company, the Grantee, and the Grantee's
assignees pursuant to Section 7 (the "parties") shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disputes arising out of or relating to the Notice, the Plan and this
Option Agreement by negotiation between individuals who have authority to settle
the controversy. Negotiations shall be commenced by either party by notice of a
written statement of the party's position and the name and title of the
individual who will represent the party. Within thirty (30) days of the written
notification, the parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place,
and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to resolve the
dispute. If the dispute has not been resolved by negotiation within ninety (90)
days of the written notification, either party may commence litigation to
resolve the dispute. THE PARTIES ALSO EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE OR MAY
HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. If any one or more
<PAGE>   7

provisions of this Section 12 shall for any reason be held invalid or
unenforceable, it is the specific intent of the parties that such provisions
shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it or its application
valid and enforceable.

        13. Notices. Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given
in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon confirmed electronic or
personal delivery or upon deposit in the United States mail by certified mail
(if the parties are within the United States) or upon deposit for delivery by an
internationally recognized express mail courier service (for international
delivery of notice), with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the Grantee at
its address as shown in the Notice or to the Company at 101 Innovation Drive,
San Jose, California 95134, or to such other address as such party may designate
in writing from time to time to the other party.

Definitions:

        As used herein, the following definitions shall apply:

        "Cause" shall be deemed to exist if (a), in the reasonable judgment of
the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Grantee: (i) commits fraud, theft or
embezzlement of a type that would be subject to prosecution under Federal or
Oregon law, against the Company or any Related Entity, and there is clear and
convincing evidence that such fraud, theft, or embezzlement occurred; (ii) is
convicted for having committed a serious felony, and such conviction has a
significant adverse effect on the affairs or business of the Company; (iii)
compromises or attempts to compromise material trade secrets or other
proprietary information of the Company and such action materially damages the
Company, or in the event of an unsuccessful attempt, would likely have caused
material damage to the Company if successful; (iv) materially breaches any
non-competition or non-solicitation agreement with the Company or any Related
Entity; (v) fails to devote such business time and effort necessary to
adequately and properly discharge his or her duties to the Company or any
Related Entity or engages in outside activities that substantially interfere
with such efforts; or (vi) engages in any grossly negligent act or willful
misconduct in the scope of his or her duties to the Company or any Related
Entity
<PAGE>   2

or (b) if the Related Entity employing the Grantee is sold or otherwise disposed
of by the Company such that it is no longer a Related Entity and the Grantee has
not been offered employment with the Company or any Related Entity on or before
such sale or other disposal. During any criminal prosecution covered by
subsection (a)(ii) above, the vesting of Shares subject to the Option shall be
suspended. If the prosecution does not result in a conviction, the Grantee shall
receive credit toward vesting for the period of the prosecution as if the
prosecution had not occurred.

        "Good Reason" means that the Company or any Related Entity employing the
Grantee has, without such Grantee's express written consent, (1) reduced such
Grantee's base salary, except in the case of a general salary reduction plan;
(2) required such Grantee to assume a position that is not in a
_______________________________ capacity; or (3) moved such Grantee's primary
workplace outside of the greater metropolitan Portland, Oregon area.

Vesting Schedule:

        (a) Subject to Grantee's Continuous Service and other limitations set
forth in this Notice, the Plan and the Option Agreement, the Option may be
exercised, in whole or in part, in accordance with the following schedule: 25%
of the Shares subject to the Option shall vest twelve months after the Vesting
Commencement Date, and an additional 25% of the Shares subject to the Option
shall vest on each yearly anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date
thereafter.

        (b) During any Approved Leave of Absence, the vesting of the Option as
provided in this schedule shall cease after the Approved Leave of Absence
exceeds a period of ninety (90) days. Vesting of the Option shall resume upon
the Grantee's termination of the Approved Leave of Absence and return to
Continuous Service to the Company or a Related Entity. The vesting schedule set
forth in (a) above shall be adjusted in the event that vesting temporarily
ceases pursuant to this paragraph.

        (c) In the event of termination of the Grantee's Continuous Service by
the Company or a Related Entity without Cause or by the Grantee for Good Reason,
such Grantee's unvested Shares subject to the Option shall fully vest
immediately upon termination of such Continuous Service.

        (d) Upon the death or Disability of the Grantee, only that portion of
such Grantee's Shares subject to the Option that would have vested on the next
anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date (subject to any adjustments in the
vesting schedule required by (b) above) shall immediately vest.

        (e) If the Grantee's Continuous Service ceases for any reason other than
by death, Disability or termination by the Company or a Related Entity without
Cause or by the Grantee for Good Reason, vesting of the Shares subject to the
Option shall immediately cease.

        2. Exercise of Option.

                (a) Right to Exercise. The Option shall be exercisable during
its term in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set out in the Notice and with
the applicable provisions of the Plan and this Option Agreement. The Option
shall be subject to the provisions of Section 11 of the Plan relating to the
exercisability or termination of the Option in the event of a Corporate
Transaction. In no event shall the Company issue fractional Shares.

                (b) Method of Exercise. The Option shall be exercisable only by
delivery to the Company or its authorized representative of an exercise notice
in the form approved by the Administrator and in effect at the time of exercise
by such method as determined from time to time by the Administrator accompanied
by payment of the Exercise Price.

                (c) Taxes. No Shares will be delivered to the Grantee or other
person pursuant to the exercise of the Option until the Grantee or other person
has made arrangements acceptable to the Administrator for the satisfaction of
applicable income tax, employment tax, and social security tax withholding
obligations, including, without limitation, obligations incident to the receipt
of Shares. Upon exercise of the Option, the Company or the Grantee's employer
may offset or withhold (from any amount owed by the Company or the Grantee's
employer to the Grantee) or collect from the Grantee or other person an amount
sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations and/or the employer's withholding
obligations.

        3. Method of Payment. Payment of the Exercise Price shall be by any of
the following, or a combination thereof, at the election of the Grantee;
provided, however, that such exercise method does not then violate any
Applicable Law and, provided further, that the portion of the Exercise Price
equal to the par value of the Shares must be paid in cash or other legal
consideration permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law:

                (a) cash;

                (b) check;
<PAGE>   5

                (c) surrender of shares of Common Stock or delivery of a
properly executed form of attestation of ownership of shares of Common Stock as
the Administrator may require (including withholding of Shares otherwise
deliverable upon exercise of the Option) which have a Fair Market Value on the
date of surrender or attestation equal to the aggregate Exercise Price of the
Shares as to which the Option is being exercised (but only to the extent that
such exercise of the Option would not result in an accounting compensation
charge with respect to the shares of Common Stock used to pay the exercise
price);

                (d) payment through a broker-dealer sale and remittance
procedure pursuant to which the Grantee (i) shall provide written instructions
to a Company designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of some or
all of the purchased Shares and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds
available on the settlement date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate
exercise price payable for the purchased Shares and (ii) shall provide written
directives to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased Shares
directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale transaction;

                (e) a reduction in the amount of any Company liability to the
Grantee, including any liability attributable to the Grantee's participation in
any Company-sponsored deferred compensation program or arrangement; or

                (f) any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

        4. Restrictions on Exercise. The Option may not be exercised if the
issuance of the Shares subject to the Option upon such exercise would constitute
a violation of any Applicable Laws.

        5. Termination or Change of Continuous Service. If Grantee's Continuous
Service is terminated by the Company or a Related Entity without Cause or by the
Grantee for Good Reason, the Grantee may, to the extent otherwise so entitled at
the date of such termination (the "Termination Date"), exercise the Option, but
only within sixty (60) days of such Termination Date. If Grantee's Continuous
Service is terminated for any other reason (other than for Disability or death,
which is governed by Section 6 below), the Grantee may, to the extent otherwise
so entitled at the Termination Date, exercise the Option, but only within thirty
(30) days of such Termination Date. In no event shall the Option be exercised
later than the Expiration Date set forth in the Notice. Except as provided in
Section 6 below, to the extent that the Grantee is not entitled to exercise the
Option on the Termination Date, or if the Grantee does not exercise the Option
within the time specified herein, the Option shall terminate.

        6. Disability or Death of Grantee. If the Grantee's Continuous Service
terminates as a result of his or her Disability or death, this Option may be
exercised, but only within six (6) months from the Termination Date (and in no
event later than the Expiration Date), and only to the extent the Grantee was
otherwise entitled to exercise it on the Termination Date. To the extent that
the Grantee is not entitled to exercise the Option on the Termination Date, or
if the Option is not exercised to the extent so entitled to be within the time
specified herein, the Option shall terminate.
<PAGE>   6

        7. Transferability of Option. The Option may be transferred to any
person by will and by the laws of descent and distribution or during the
lifetime of the Grantee pursuant to a domestic relations order to the extent and
in the manner determined by the Administrator. The terms of the Option shall be
binding upon the executors, administrators, heirs, successors and transferees of
the Grantee.

        8. Term of Option. The Option may be exercised no later than the
Expiration Date set forth in the Notice or such earlier date as otherwise
provided herein.

        9. Tax Consequences. THE COMPANY MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY TO
THE GRANTEE AS TO THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF VESTING OR EXERCISE OF AN OPTION AND
DISPOSITION OF THE SHARES. ACCORDINGLY, THE GRANTEE SHOULD CONSULT A TAX ADVISER
REGARDING VESTING OR EXERCISING OF THE OPTION OR DISPOSING OF THE SHARES.

        10. Entire Agreement: Governing Law. The Notice, the Plan and this
Option Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and supersede in their entirety all prior undertakings
and agreements of the Company and the Grantee with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and may not be modified adversely to the Grantee's interest except by
means of a writing signed by the Company and the Grantee. Nothing in the Notice,
the Plan and this Option Agreement (except as expressly provided therein) is
intended to confer any rights or remedies on any persons other than the parties.
The Notice, the Plan and this Option Agreement are to be construed in accordance
with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of
any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of Delaware to the
rights and duties of the parties. Should any provision of the Notice, the Plan
or this Option Agreement be determined by a court of law to be illegal or
unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by
law and the other provisions shall nevertheless remain effective and shall
remain enforceable.

        11. Headings. The captions used in the Notice and this Option Agreement
are inserted for convenience and shall not be deemed a part of the Option for
construction or interpretation.

        12. Dispute Resolution The provisions of this Section 12 shall be the
exclusive means of resolving disputes arising out of or relating to the Notice,
the Plan and this Option Agreement. The Company, the Grantee, and the Grantee's
assignees pursuant to Section 7 (the "parties") shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any disputes arising out of or relating to the Notice, the Plan and this
Option Agreement by negotiation between individuals who have authority to settle
the controversy. Negotiations shall be commenced by either party by notice of a
written statement of the party's position and the name and title of the
individual who will represent the party. Within thirty (30) days of the written
notification, the parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place,
and thereafter as often as they reasonably deem necessary, to resolve the
dispute. If the dispute has not been resolved by negotiation within ninety (90)
days of the written notification, either party may commence litigation to
resolve the dispute. THE PARTIES ALSO EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE OR MAY
HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. If any one or more
<PAGE>   7

provisions of this Section 12 shall for any reason be held invalid or
unenforceable, it is the specific intent of the parties that such provisions
shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it or its application
valid and enforceable.

        13. Notices. Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given
in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon confirmed electronic or
personal delivery or upon deposit in the United States mail by certified mail
(if the parties are within the United States) or upon deposit for delivery by an
internationally recognized express mail courier service (for international
delivery of notice), with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the Grantee at
its address as shown in the Notice or to the Company at 101 Innovation Drive,
San Jose, California 95134, or to such other address as such party may designate
in writing from time to time to the other party.
