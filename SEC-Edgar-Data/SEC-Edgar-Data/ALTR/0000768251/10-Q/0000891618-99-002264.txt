Note 4 - Earnings Per Share:

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period and excludes the dilutive effect of stock options. Diluted earnings
per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding
during a period. In computing diluted earnings per share, the tax benefit
resulting from employee stock transactions and the average stock price for the
period are used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from
exercise of stock options.

A reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share is presented below (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

Note 5 - Common Stock Repurchase:

In March 1999, the Company repurchased 260,000 shares of common stock for an
aggregate cost of $12.8 million. The repurchased shares were retired upon
acquisition. Since the inception of the repurchase program through March 31,
1999, the Company has repurchased a total of 2,370,000 shares.

Note 6 - Convertible Subordinated Notes:

In June 1995, the Company issued $230.0 million of convertible subordinated
notes (the "Notes") due in June 2002 and bearing an interest rate of 5.75%,
payable semiannually. The Notes were convertible into shares of the Company's
common stock at a price of $25.59 per share. On May 15, 1998, the Company called
for the redemption of the Notes effective June 16, 1998. As a result,
substantially all of the Notes were converted into 8,988,649 shares of common
stock with the remaining Notes redeemed at a price of $1,033.06 per $1,000
principal amount of the Notes. Total semi-annual interest paid on the Notes
during 1998 was $6.5 million. The unamortized debt issuance costs as of the
redemption date of approximately $3.1 million was recorded as a reduction to
additional paid-in-capital.


Note 7 - New Accounting Pronouncements:

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 establishes standards for
accounting and reporting on derivative instruments for periods beginning after
June 15, 1999 and early adoption is permitted. SFAS No. 133 requires that all
derivative instruments be recognized in the balance sheet as either assets or
liabilities and measured at fair value. Furthermore, SFAS No. 133 requires
current recognition in earnings of changes in the fair value of derivative
instruments depending on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation. The Company expects that its adoption of SFAS No. 133, which will
become effective in fiscal year 2000, will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial statements.

                               ALTERA CORPORATION
                      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
                OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

         Sales. Sales during the first quarter of 1999 were $186.4 million,
18.6% higher than the $157.2 million reported for the same period last year.
Sales in the first quarter of 1999 increased from the same period last year
primarily due to increases in sales of New and Mainstream products, which were
partially offset by lower sales of Mature products. Sales of New products
increased to $40.0 million in the first quarter of 1999 from $8.9 million in the
first quarter of 1998 while sales of Mainstream products increased to $69.9
million from $43.2 million. During the same periods, sales of Mature products
decreased to $60.2 million from $90.2 million. Management expects that the
decline in sales of the Mature products, which presently comprise approximately
32.3% of the Company's revenue base, will continue. The Company's ability to
maintain or increase sales in the future is dependent on sales of New and
Mainstream product families increasing more rapidly than the decline in sales of
Mature product families. While management is optimistic that New and Mainstream
product sales will increase, there can be no assurances that New and Mainstream
product sales growth will offset the decline in sales of Mature products.

         Sales during the first quarter of 1999 increased over the comparable
quarter a year ago in North America, Japan and Asia Pacific, while sales in
Europe declined slightly. Sales during the first quarter of 1999 as compared to
the first quarter of 1998 from North America increased to $105.2 million from
$86.9 million, Japan increased to $35.7 million from $28.1 million, and Asia
Pacific increased to $9.7 million from $5.6 million, while Europe decreased
slightly to $35.8 million from $36.6 million. The poor economic environment in
Japan and Asia Pacific may limit the Company's future sales of its products in
these regions, particularly in the communications segment. As the economic
environment in Japan and Asia Pacific remains unfavorable, the Company's overall
sales may be adversely impacted as a result.

         Product Categories. In the third quarter of 1998 the composition of the
Company's product categories was changed and prior data reported here have been
restated to reflect those changes. New products now consist of the Company's
3.3-volt (or lower) families, are manufactured on a 0.35-micron (or finer)
geometry and are made up of the FLEX 10KA/10KE, FLEX 6000/6000A, MAX 7000A/7000B
and APEX families. Mainstream products now include the MAX 7000S, MAX 9000 and
FLEX 10K families. Mature products now consist of the Classic, MAX 5000, MAX
7000 and FLEX 8000 families. Other products include Tools, FLASHlogic,
Configuration Devices, MPLDs, and FSPs.

         Gross Margin. The gross margin as a percentage of sales of 62.9% was up
from 61.8% in the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily
attributable to higher margins earned on the increasing mix of the Company's New
products.



                                                                               9
<PAGE>   10

         Yields measured as a total for all product families increased in the
first quarter of 1999 over the same period a year ago primarily due to improved
yields on FLEX 10K and FLEX 10KA products. In addition, the Company achieved
additional cost reductions on its FLEX 10KA family through new wafer process
technologies (die shrinks). The Company continues to spend significant research
and development resources to improve production yields on both new and
established products. Difficulties in production yields can often occur when the
Company is beginning production of new products or transitioning to new
processes. These difficulties can potentially result in significantly higher
costs and lower product availability. Management expects to continue to
introduce new and established products using new process technologies and may
encounter similar start-up difficulties during the transition to such process
technologies. Further, production throughput times vary considerably among the
Company's wafer suppliers, and the Company may experience delays from time to
time in processing some of its products which also may result in higher costs
and lower product availability.

         Research and Development. Research and development expenditures were
$17.0 million in the first quarter of 1999, which is higher than the $14.4
million for the same period a year ago. Relative to the same period a year ago,
expenses increased primarily as a result of increased headcount, spending on
masks and wafers and outside development services. This increased spending
relates to the development of new products including FLEX 10KA/10KE, MAX
7000A/7000B and APEX, as well as the Quartus software. The research and
development expenditures include expenditures for labor, prototype and
pre-production costs, development of process technology, development of software
to support new products and design environments, and development of new
packages. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenditures were
9.1% and 9.2% for the first quarters of 1999 and 1998, respectively.
Historically, the level of research and development expenditures as a percentage
of sales has fluctuated in part due to the timing of the purchase of masks and
wafers used in development and prototyping of new products. The Company expects
that, in the long term, research and development expenses will increase in
absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of sales.

         The Company expects to continue to make significant investments in the
development of FLEX 10KA/10KE, MAX 7000A/7000B, APEX and Quartus software.
During the first quarter of 1999, the Company shipped its newest family of
devices, APEX, and its new fourth generation software design tool, Quartus. APEX
devices utilize a new architecture for programmable logic and address higher
density designs. APEX devices are exclusively supported by the Company's new
software design tool, Quartus. The commercial success of the APEX family is
dependent on the acceptance of its use in high density designs and the
successful introduction and acceptance of the Quartus design software.
Management expects both products to be successful in the market, however, it can
give no assurances that this will be the case. The Company also continues to
focus its efforts on the development of new programmable logic chips, related
development software and hardware, and advanced semiconductor wafer fabrication
processes. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will accomplish
its goals in the development and subsequent introduction of new products and
manufacturing processes. Furthermore, there is no assurance that these products
will achieve 



                                                                              10
<PAGE>   11

market acceptance, that the new manufacturing processes will be successful, or
that the suppliers will provide the Company with the quality or quantity of
wafers and materials that the Company requires. The Company must continue to
develop and introduce new products in a timely manner to help counter the
industry's historical trend of declining prices as products mature.

         Selling, General and Administrative. First quarter selling, general and
administrative expenses of $32.3 million were $4.2 million higher than the same
quarter a year ago. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses
was mainly driven by increased personnel expenses for marketing and
administration, higher commission and incentive expenses associated with higher
sales, and increased legal expenses. Selling, general, and administrative
expenses include commission and incentive expenses, advertising and promotional
expenditures, legal expenses and salary expenses related to field sales,
marketing and administrative personnel.

         Income from Operations. First quarter 1999 operating income of $67.9
million, representing 36.4% of sales, was higher than the $54.6 million for the
same period a year ago, representing 34.7% of sales. The year-to-year increase
in operating income, as a percentage of sales, was primarily due to improvements
in gross margin and to a lesser degree reduced operating expenses (selling,
general and administrative plus research and development) as a percentage of
sales.

         Interest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income was $4.6
million for the first quarter of 1999, which is higher than the $152,000 for the
same period a year ago. Interest and other income in the first quarter of 1999
increased from the same period last year primarily due to the reduction in
interest expense related to the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes
and the increase in interest income related to higher cash balances available
for investment. The increase in interest and other income was partially offset
by a $1.2 million charge attributed to the write-off of an equity investment
during the first quarter of 1999. Interest and other income mainly consists of
interest income on cash balances available for investment.

         Provision for Income Taxes. The Company's effective tax rate was 32.5%
for the three months ended March 31, 1999 and 1998.

         Equity Investment. In June 1996, the Company, TSMC and several other
partners formed WaferTech, LLC ("WaferTech"), a joint-venture company, to build
and operate a wafer manufacturing plant in Camas, Washington. In return for a
$140.4 million cash investment, the Company received an 18% equity ownership in
the joint-venture company and certain rights and obligations to procure up to
27% of the factory's output at market prices. In January 1999, the Company
purchased from Analog Devices, Inc. an additional 5% equity ownership interest
in WaferTech for approximately $37.5 million, increasing its ownership interest
to 23% and enabling the Company to procure up to 35% of the factory's output at
market prices. The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method
based on the Company's ability to exercise significant influence on the
operating and financial policies of WaferTech. The



                                                                              11
<PAGE>   12

Company's equity in the net loss of WaferTech was $2.0 million for the first
quarter of 1999 as compared to $1.8 million for the same period a year ago.

         Future Results. Future operating results will depend on the Company's
ability to develop, manufacture and sell complex semiconductor components and
programming software that offer customers greater value than solutions offered
by competing vendors. The Company's efforts in this regard may not be
successful. The Company plans to sustain future growth by offering programmable
chips for applications that are presently served by other ASIC vendors. These
vendors have well-established market positions and a solution that has been
proven technically feasible and economically competitive over several decades.
There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in displacing ASIC
vendors in the targeted applications and densities. Furthermore, other
programmable logic vendors are targeting these applications and may be
successful in securing market share to the exclusion of the Company. Moreover,
standard cell technologies are increasingly used by the Company's customers to
achieve greater integration in their systems; this may not only impede the
Company's efforts to penetrate the ASIC market but may also displace the
Company's products in the applications that it presently serves. The Company's
future growth will depend on its ability to continue to expand the programmable
logic market.

         The Company is highly dependent upon subcontractors to manufacture
silicon wafers and perform assembly, test and shipment to end customers. The
Company is also dependent on its wafer foundry partners to improve process
technologies in a timely manner to enhance the Company's product designs and
cost structure. Their inability to do so could have a severe negative impact on
the Company. The vast majority of the Company's products are manufactured and
shipped to customers by subcontractors located in Asia, principally Japan,
Taiwan, Korea, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Several of these
countries are experiencing significant economic disruptions including volatile
exchange rates, rising unemployment, insolvencies and government fiscal
austerity programs. Disruptions or adverse supply conditions arising from market
conditions, political strife, labor disruptions and other factors could have
adverse consequences on the Company's future results. Natural or man-made
disasters, normal process fluctuations and variances in manufacturing yields
could have a severe negative impact on the Company's operating capabilities. The
Company has sought to diversify its operating risk by participating in the
WaferTech joint venture to manufacture silicon wafers with other partners in
Camas, Washington. In October 1998 production began at the WaferTech joint
venture. WaferTech is currently in the initial stages of production volumes and
has yet to make a profit. Although the Company expects future WaferTech
production volumes and profitability to increase, there is currently an
oversupply of semiconductor fabrication capacity. There can be no assurances
that the worldwide supply and demand for semiconductor wafers will be such that
WaferTech will make a profit and that WaferTech will not continue to have an
adverse impact on the Company's operating results.

         Also, a number of factors outside of the Company's control, including
general economic conditions and cycles in world markets, exchange rate
fluctuations or a lack of growth in the Company's end markets 



                                                                              12
<PAGE>   13

could adversely impact future results. An important component of the Company's
growth, the networking equipment market, has been growing at a slower rate in
recent years. Should this trend continue, the Company's growth in future years
may be limited.

         Because of the foregoing and other factors that might affect the
Company's operating results, past financial performance should not be considered
an indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical
trends to anticipate future results. In addition, the cyclical nature of the
semiconductor industry and other factors have resulted in a highly volatile
price of the Company's common stock.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

         During the first quarter of 1999, the Company's cash, cash equivalents
and short-term investments increased by $11.8 million as a result of an increase
in cash and cash equivalents of $47.9 million, offset by a decrease in
short-term investments of $36.1 million.

         Operating Activities. During the first quarter of 1999, the Company's
operating activities generated net cash of $61.5 million. This increase was
primarily attributable to net income of $47.0 million adjusted by non-cash items
including depreciation and amortization of $7.5 million and the equity in loss
in WaferTech of $2.0 million. In addition, positive cash flow was generated from
a decrease in accounts receivable and other assets of $10.6 million and an
increase in income taxes payable of $18.7 million. These items were partially
offset by an increase in inventories and deferred income taxes of $6.1 million
and a decrease in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and deferred income on
sales to distributors of $18.0 million.

         Investing Activities. During the first quarter of 1999, the net cash
used by the Company in its investing activities was $7.1 million. The Company
invested $5.7 million mainly for manufacturing and data processing equipment and
software. Also, the Company purchased from Analog Devices, Inc. an additional 5%
equity ownership interest in WaferTech for approximately $37.5 million. Lastly,
the Company had a $36.1 million (net) reduction in short-term investments.

         Financing Activities. During the first quarter of 1999, the net cash
used by the Company in its financing activities was $6.6 million. The Company
repurchased 260,000 shares of its common stock for $12.8 million, partially
offset by net proceeds of $6.3 million from the issuance of approximately
762,000 shares of common stock to employees through various option and employee
stock purchase plans.

         Financial condition. The Company has historically financed its
operations primarily through cash generated from operations.

         As of March 31, 1999, the Company had $590.9 million of cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments available to finance future growth. The
Company believes the available sources of funds and 



                                                                              13
<PAGE>   14

cash expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance
current operations and capital expenditures for at least the next year.

         Impact of Currency and Inflation. The Company purchases the majority of
its materials and services in U.S. dollars, and its foreign sales are transacted
in U.S. dollars. However, Altera does have Japanese yen denominated purchase
contracts with Sharp Corporation of Japan for processed silicon wafers. In
recent years, the Company did not hold or purchase any foreign exchange
contracts for the purchase or sale of Japanese yen. During the first half of
1998, the Company entered into a forward exchange contract to purchase Malaysian
ringgit to meet a portion of its firm contractual commitments for the
construction of its Malaysian design and manufacturing center. At the end of the
first quarter of 1999, the Company had no open forward contracts. The Company
may choose to enter into similar contracts from time to time should conditions
appear favorable. Effects of inflation on Altera's financial results have not
been significant.

Year 2000 Compliance

         Most computer programs were designed to perform data computations on
the last two digits of the numerical value of a year. When a computation
referencing the year 2000 is performed, these systems may interpret "00" as the
year 1900 and could either stop processing date-related computations or could
process them incorrectly. Computations referencing the year 2000 might be
invoked at any time, but are likely to begin occurring in the year 1999.

         Pursuant to its year 2000 ("Y2K") compliance program, the Company has
undertaken various initiatives intended to ensure that its computer equipment
and software will function properly with respect to dates in the year 2000 and
thereafter. As used herein, the term "computer equipment and software" includes
systems that are commonly considered information technology ("IT") systems
(e.g., accounting, data processing and telephone systems) as well as those that
are not commonly considered IT systems (e.g., manufacturing equipment, building
and facility operations systems). In addition, the Company has also reviewed the
software products it sells, and has upgraded and will upgrade such products to
offer full Y2K compliance. Based upon its identification and assessment efforts
to date, the Company anticipates that by the end of June 1999, all computer
equipment and software that are material to Altera's internal business
operations and all software products that Altera sells will be fully compliant
with Y2K standards, specifically DISC PD-2000-1 as published by the British
Standards Institute. The Company has not incurred and does not anticipate that
it will incur material expenditures for the remediation of any Y2K issues.

         The Company could be adversely impacted by Y2K issues faced by major
distributors, suppliers, customers, vendors and financial service organizations
("Third Parties") with which the Company interacts. The most reasonably likely
worst case scenario for the Company with respect to the Y2K problem is the
failure of a major distributor or supplier to be Y2K compliant such that the
distribution of Altera products or the supply of components for such products is
interrupted temporarily. This could result in the Company not being able



                                                                              14
<PAGE>   15

to produce or distribute product for a period of time, which in turn could
result in lost sales and profits. Based solely on responses received from these
Third Parties, the Company has no reason to believe that there will be any
material adverse impact on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations relating to any Y2K issues of such Third Parties. However, if the
responses received from these Third Parties are not accurate or circumstances
change, then there could be an unforeseen material adverse impact on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations. Management will
continue to determine the impact, if any, that Third Parties who are not Y2K
compliant may have on the financial condition or results of operations of the
Company.

         The Company has charged its business resumption planning committee to
evaluate Y2K business disruption scenarios, coordinate the establishment of Y2K
contingency plans, and identify and implement preemptive strategies. Contingency
plans for critical business processes will be developed by the end of June 1999.

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings

         In June 1993, Xilinx, Inc. ("Xilinx") brought suit against the Company
seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the Company's alleged
infringement of certain patents held by Xilinx. In June 1993, the Company
brought suit against Xilinx, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief
based on Xilinx's alleged infringement of certain patents held by the Company.
In April 1995, the Company filed a separate lawsuit against Xilinx in Delaware,
Xilinx's state of incorporation, seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief
based on Xilinx's alleged infringement of one of the Company's patents. In May
1995, Xilinx counterclaimed against the Company in Delaware, asserting defenses
and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the Company's
alleged infringement of certain patents held by Xilinx. Subsequently, the
Delaware case has been transferred to California. Due to the nature of the
litigation with Xilinx and because the lawsuits are still in the pre-trial
stage, the Company's management cannot estimate the total expense, the possible
loss, if any, or the range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection
with the allegations. Management cannot ensure that Xilinx will not succeed in
obtaining significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture
and sale of the Company's MAX 5000, MAX 7000, FLEX 8000 or MAX 9000 families of
products, or succeed in invalidating any of the Company's patents. Although no
assurances can be given as to the results of these cases, based on the present
status, management does not believe that any of such results will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations.

         In August 1994, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD") brought suit
against the Company seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief based on the
Company's alleged infringement of certain patents held by AMD. In September
1994, Altera answered the complaint asserting that it is licensed to use the
patents which AMD claims are infringed and filed a counterclaim against AMD
alleging infringement of certain patents held by the Company. In October 1997,
upon completion of trials bifurcated from the infringement claims, the District
Court ruled that the Company is licensed under all patents asserted by AMD in
the suit. In December 1997, AMD filed a Notice of Appeal of the District Court's
rulings. In April 1999, the Federal Circuit Court ruled in AMD's favor on its
appeal, finding that Altera is not licensed to AMD's patents, and remanded the
case back to the District Court for further proceedings. Altera has filed a
petition for rehearing before the Federal Circuit Court to seek an overturn of
this determination. Due to the nature of the litigation with AMD, the Company's
management cannot estimate the total expense, the possible loss, if any, or the
range of loss that may ultimately be incurred in connection with the
allegations. Management cannot ensure that AMD will not succeed in obtaining
significant monetary damages or an injunction against the manufacture and sale
of the Classic, MAX 5000, MAX 7000, FLEX 8000, MAX 9000, FLEX 10K and FLASHlogic
product families, or succeed in invalidating any of the Company's patents
remaining in the suit. Although no assurances can be given as to the results of
this case, based on its present status, management does not believe that any of
such results will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition or results of operations.

<PAGE>   18

         On April 21, 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a
two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. Holders of record of
the Company's common stock on May 4, 1999 will receive one additional share of
Company common stock for each share held. The market price for Altera common
stock as reported by Nasdaq will reflect the stock split beginning May 20, 1999.
In connection with the stock split, the Board of Directors of the Company also
authorized doubling from 6,000,000 to 12,000,000 the number of shares authorized
for repurchase under the Company's share repurchase program.

      Altera.

      3.4 Distributor's Financial Condition. Distributor is in satisfactory
      financial condition, solvent and able to pay its bills when due. Altera

      requirements as a condition of Distributor's right to place orders with
      Altera and shall also have the right in its reasonable discretion to
      change such credit limits and financial requirements at any time. In
      connection with any decision by Altera to establish a credit limit for

4.    ALTERA'S RESPONSIBILITY

      Altera will furnish Distributor without charge a reasonable supply of
      Altera's current list of published suggested prices, sales literature,
      books, catalogs, etc. as Altera may prepare for distribution, and shall

      be necessary to assist Distributor in effectively carrying out its
      obligations under this Agreement. Altera reserves the right to sell
      directly to any and all customers.

5.    ORDER PROCEDURE

      5.1 Orders. Distributor will place individual orders for the Products from
      time to time during the term of this Agreement either by means of
      electronic data transmission or in written form. This Agreement shall
      govern to the extent that any terms in this Agreement are inconsistent
      with the terms of any agreement between Altera and Distributor relating to
      electronic data transmission. Each order placed by Distributor will
      contain the following minimum information: (i) identification of each
      Product ordered by Product number, quantity, and price; (ii) shipping
      instructions and destination; and (iii) a requested delivery date for each
      Product.

      5.2 Acceptance by Altera. All orders for the Products by Distributor shall
      be subject to acceptance by Altera and shall not be binding until the
      earlier of such acceptance or shipment, and, in the case of acceptance by
      shipment, only as to the portion of the order actually shipped. Altera has
      the right to refuse to accept, for any reason, any order placed by
      Distributor. Altera shall use its reasonable best efforts to accept any
      order for non-custom Products within ten (10) days of its receipt.

      5.3 Controlling Terms. The terms of this Agreement will apply to each
      order accepted or shipped by Altera under this Agreement. In the event
      that any terms or conditions of sale contained in any communication
      between Distributor and Altera contradict or are inconsistent with
      anything contained in this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement shall prevail. Altera's acceptance of any order from Distributor
      under this Agreement is conditioned on Distributor agreeing that the terms
      of this Agreement shall prevail over any additional or inconsistent terms
      communicated by Distributor to Altera in any form whatsoever.

                                                                               5



      5.4 Quantity. All component orders of custom Products only are subject to
      an overrun or underrun of five percent (5%) of the quantity ordered which
      shall constitute fulfillment of the order by Altera.

      5.5  Change Orders and Cancellation by Distributor.

           (a) Standard Products: All orders submitted by Distributor and
      accepted by Altera are firm commitments by Distributor to buy Altera
      Products. Distributor will notify Altera in a timely manner of its desire
      to change any order. Altera shall have the right to deny any change order
      request submitted by Distributor within ninety (90) days of the current
      factory scheduled shipment date. However, within the period from thirty
      (30) to ninety (90) days of the current factory scheduled shipment date,
      Altera will accommodate reasonable requests for changes. Within the period
      from zero (0) to thirty (30) days of current factory scheduled shipment
      date, Altera will accept change orders only in extraordinary
      circumstances; Altera's shall have the sole right to determine what
      circumstances are extraordinary. Altera's acceptance of any change order
      request within 30 days of current factory scheduled shipment shall not
      obligate Altera to accept future change order requests submitted within 30
      days of shipment. On an ongoing and regular basis, Distributor will use
      its best efforts to reconcile its own records of orders on Altera with
      Altera's records of order backlog.

           (b) Custom Products: From time to time, Distributor may place orders
      on Altera for Custom Product. (Custom Product is defined as Product that
      is not listed in Altera's published distributor price list and/or that
      requires special processing by Altera.) Once accepted by Altera, orders
      for Custom Product may not be changed in any way without prior approval of
      Altera. As a pre-condition to approving a request to change an order for
      Custom Product, Altera may require Distributor to compensate Altera for
      any costs incurred by Altera as a result of the change order.

      5.6 Cancellation by Altera. Altera reserves the right to cancel any orders
      placed by Distributor and accepted by Altera as set forth above, or to
      refuse or delay shipment thereof, if:

           (a) Distributor fails to make any payment as provided in this
      Agreement or under the terms of payment set forth in any invoice or
      otherwise agreed to by Altera and Distributor;

           (b) Distributor fails to meet reasonable credit or financial
      requirements established by Altera, including any limitations on allowable
      credit;

           (c) Distributor otherwise fails to comply with the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement;

           (d) this Agreement is terminated and the scheduled delivery would
      take place after the Agreement's termination date; or

           (e) circumstances beyond Altera's control prevent it from shipping
      any order by the requested delivery date.

                                                                               6



      Altera also reserves the right to discontinue the manufacture or
      distribution of any or all of the Products at any time, and to cancel any
      orders for such discontinued Products without liability of any kind to
      Distributor or to any other person except as expressly set forth herein.
      No such discontinuation will be deemed a termination (unless Altera so
      advises Distributor) or breach of this Agreement by Altera. Altera will
      attempt, but is not required, to provide Distributor with at least sixty
      (60) days advance written notice of Product discontinuances in the same
      manner as is provided to customers in general.

6.    PAYMENT  

      6.1 Terms and Interest. Payment shall be made according to the terms
      specified in writing by Altera. Interest shall be payable at the rate of
      one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month or at the maximum rate permitted
      by law, whichever is less, on all overdue and unpaid invoices. Altera has
      the right to invoice Distributor for any unauthorized discounts or
      deductions taken by Distributor, and Distributor shall make payment on
      such invoices net thirty (30) days.

      6.2 Method of Payment. Distributor shall make payment in Dollars as
      designated by Altera or in such other method as agreed to by the parties
      in writing.

      6.3 Taxes, Tariffs, and Fees. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by
      Altera, all prices quoted by Altera for the Products do not include any
      national, state, or local sales, use, value added or other taxes, customs
      duties, or similar tariffs and fees. Distributor shall be responsible and
      liable for the payment of any taxes, customs duties, or other government
      fees and tariffs applicable to the Products, except for taxes based on
      Altera's net income, unless Distributor has provided Altera with an
      exemption resale certificate in the appropriate form for the jurisdiction
      to which the Products are to be directly shipped. Distributor agrees to
      indemnify Altera for any claim for taxes, customs duties, or other
      government fees and tariffs applicable to the Products that may be levied
      on Altera.

7.    SHIPMENT AND RISK OF LOSS:  

      7.1 Shipment. Orders issued by the Distributor will specify requested
      shipment dates. Distributor will select the mode of shipment and the
      carrier. Altera will pay for packing costs. Distributor will be
      responsible for and pay all charges for shipping, freight, and any
      insurance requested by Distributor, which charges Altera may require
      Distributor to pay in advance.

      7.2 Delays in Shipment. Altera will use commercially reasonable efforts to
      ship products to arrive by any requested delivery dates quoted or
      acknowledged. However, Altera will not be liable for any delay in shipment
      or delay in performance under this Agreement due to unforeseen
      circumstances or due to causes beyond its control including but not
      limited to, acts of nature, acts of government, labor disputes, delays in
      transportation, and delays in delivery or inability to deliver by Altera's
      suppliers.

      7.3 Risk of Loss. All risk of loss of, or damage to, the Products will
      pass to Distributor, or to such financing institution or other party or
      parties as may have been designated to Altera by Distributor, upon
      delivery by Altera to the carrier, freight forwarder or Distributor,
      whichever first occurs. Distributor will bear the risk of loss or damage
      in transit.

8.    PRICES

      8.1 Altera's Prices. Distributor shall purchase products at Altera's
      prices as are in effect at the time the order is received from the
      Distributor.

      8.2 Price Changes: From time to time, Altera may decide to change the
      prices for the Products.

           (a) Price decreases: In the event of a price decrease by Altera,
      Altera will invoice Distributor at the lower price for all orders placed
      by Distributor that have not been delivered as of the effective date of
      the price decrease.

           (b) Price increases: In the event of a price increase, Altera will
      announce to Distributor its intention to raise prices at least 30 days
      before the effective date of such a price increase. All orders on Altera's
      backlog as of the announcement of the price increase and scheduled for
      delivery by Altera within 30 days of announcement shall be shipped at the
      price that was effective before the price increase. All other orders shall
      ship at the new, increased price. Distributor shall have the right to
      cancel (within ten days of the announcement of a price increase) any
      orders for Product for which Altera has announced a price increase.

      8.3 Credit for Inventory Invoiced at Higher Price. In the event of a price
      decrease, Altera shall issue a credit to Distributor in the amount of the
      price decrease for all unsold Products then stocked by the Distributor
      provided that Distributor satisfies the terms and conditions specified in
      subparagraph 8.4 and 8.5(b) and (c).

      8.4 Record Keeping for Price Decrease Credits. As a condition of Altera
      issuing Distributor a credit pursuant to subparagraph 8.3, Altera must
      receive an inventory report from Distributor no later than thirty (30)
      days after the effective date of the price decrease. No credit will be due
      Distributor if Distributor fails to furnish such inventory report within
      the thirty-day period. Altera shall have the right to audit the
      information provided in this report against the previous inventory reports
      and subsequent resale reports. Altera may conduct such audit upon
      reasonable notice during normal business hours at the Distributor's place
      of business by, among other things, reviewing the Distributor's applicable
      books and records. Upon verification of Distributor's claim for credit,
      Altera shall issue a credit to Distributor's account.

      8.5  Procedure for Submitting Claims for Credit.


<PAGE>   8

                                                                               8



           (a) Distributor must submit its claims for the following types of
      credits within sixty days of the following:

                  (i) Price Discrepancies: the date of any invoice that contains
                  a price discrepancy; or

                  (ii) SSD (ship from stock debit): sales out date.

      Altera will not honor any claims for credit submitted after the sixty-day
      period.

           (b) All claims for credit must specify the invoice number(s) to
      which the claim applies.

           (c) If Altera provided Distributor with a discount on its regular
      prices at the time that Altera invoiced Distributor for the Products that
      are the subject of a claim for credit, Altera shall subtract from the
      credit the proportional amount of the prior discount.

9.    STOCK ROTATION AND RETURNS

      9.1 Return of Products. If Altera determines in accordance with its Stock
      Rotation Policy that Distributor's inventory is overstocked with certain
      Products, Distributor may return such Products to Altera pursuant to
      subparagraph 9.2. Products that are obsolete or discontinued may be
      returned pursuant to subparagraph 9.3 of this Agreement. Returns of
      Products that are permitted in connection with the termination of this
      Agreement are subject to paragraph 15. All returns require a Return
      Material Authorization ("RMA").

           Distributor shall bear all risk of loss or damage during shipment of
      returned Products and shall ship returned Products in accordance with
      Altera's reasonable instructions.

             Altera will credit distributor's account in the amount of the net
      price paid by Distributor for the returned Products after Altera receives
      the Products and verifies their quantity and quality. All returned
      Products must be unused, undamaged, and in sealed, factory-shipped boxes.
      Distributor may not take any deductions from payments due to Altera before
      Altera has issued a credit to Distributor; Altera will charge interest at
      the rate of one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month or at the maximum
      rate permitted by law, whichever is less, from the date that Distributor
      makes any unauthorized deductions.

      9.2 Procedure for Stock Rotations. At regular six-month intervals, Altera
      will accept a Stock Rotation return from Distributor for the purpose of
      clearing Distributor's inventory of Product that in Distributor's good
      faith judgment is unlikely to be sold. Under this provision, Distributor
      may return to Altera Product valued at up to 5% of Altera's net billings
      to Distributor for the six months prior to the Stock Rotation. A certain
      percentage of this amount may be allocated to scrap in accordance with the
      guidelines established by Altera in the Distributor Policies and
      Procedures Manual. As a precondition for accepting a Stock Rotation,
      Altera may require that Distributor take delivery from Altera of Product
      of value equal to or less than the value of the Product returned.

      9.3 Obsolete and Discontinued Products. Altera may render obsolete or
      discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of any Product ("Discontinued
      Product") and shall notify Distributor of any Discontinued Product.
      Distributor shall have the right to return Discontinued Product to Altera.
      Within thirty (30) days of the last date that orders will be accepted,
      Distributor shall notify Altera of Distributor's intention to return any
      Discontinued Product in its inventory which were purchased by Distributor
      from Altera.

      9.4 Administrative Procedures for Returns. Product returns to Altera
      pursuant to subparagraphs 9.2, 9.3, and 15.5(c) as well as any other
      Product returns to Altera are subject to the following provisions:

           (a) Distributor must request and receive from Altera a Return
      Material Authorization number for each return prior to shipping Product to
      Altera. Altera will not unreasonably withhold return Material
      Authorizations.

           (b) Altera retains the right to review all line items prior to return
      and approve or deny any item requested for return by Distributor. Altera
      will establish and publish reasonable requirements not inconsistent with
      the terms hereof for the approval of return line items, and for the
      handling and packaging of Product to be returned, in order to protect the
      quality of Altera Products and minimize the administrative expenses to
      both parties associated with returns.

           (c) Return Material Authorization numbers are valid for 60 days from
      the date of issuance to Distributor. If Distributor fails to return the
      Products within that 60-day period, Altera shall not be obligated to
      accept the Products or to credit Distributor's account for the Products.

      9.5 Defective Products. Defective or non-conforming Products shall be
      subject to the warranty provision of paragraph 10 of this Agreement.

10.   WARRANTIES

      the Semiconductor Product is non-conforming or defective, and (4) Altera
      determining that this warranty applies to the Semiconductor Product. Any
      replacement of a Semiconductor Product by Altera shall carry only the
      unexpired term of the original warranty.

      (b) Software Products. Altera warrants that Software Products covered by
      this Agreement, when properly installed and used, will perform
      substantially in accordance with Altera's current Software Products
      documentation for a period of up to ninety (90) days from the date of
      shipment to Distributor's customer but in no event longer than one year
      from the date of shipment to Distributor. Altera warrants the diskette(s)
      on which Software Products are furnished to be free from defects in

      Product which performs substantially in accordance with current Software
      Product documentation or a diskette which is free of defects in materials
      or workmanship, Distributor may return the Software Product for a credit
      in the amount paid by Distributor. Any replacement Programs or diskettes
      will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or
      thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.

      (c) THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN PARAGRAPH 10 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE THE
      ONLY WARRANTIES MADE BY ALTERA WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS. EXCEPT AS
      PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 10, ALTERA MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,

      PARAGRAPH 10 MAY BE MODIFIED OR AMENDED BY ALTERA ONLY BY WRITTEN
      INSTRUMENT SIGNED BY A DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT OF ALTERA.

<PAGE>   11

                                                                              11



      11.1 Trademark Use During Agreement. During the term of this Agreement,
      Distributor is authorized by Altera to use the Trademarks in connection
      with Distributor's advertisement, promotion, and distribution of the
      Products. Distributor shall use the Trademarks only in signs and printed
      material furnished or approved in writing by an authorized representative
      of Altera. Distributor shall not use the Trademarks, or any part thereof,
      separately or in combination, as a part of or in connection with its firm,
      trade, or corporate name. Distributor's use of the Trademarks will be in
      accordance with Altera's policies in effect from time to time, including
      but not limited to trademark usage and co-operative advertising policies.

      11.2 Copyright, Patent, and Trademark Notices. As both a covenant by
      Distributor and a condition of Altera's sale or license of the Products to
      Distributor, Distributor will include on each copy of the Products that it
      distributes, and on all containers and storage media, all copyright,
      patent, trademark, and other notices of proprietary rights included by
      Altera on the Products. Distributor agrees not to alter, erase, deface, or
      overprint any such notice on anything provided by Altera.

      11.3 No Distributor Rights in Altera Intellectual Property Rights.
      Distributor has paid no consideration for the use of Altera's copyrights,
      patents, trademarks, or trade secrets and nothing contained in this
      Agreement shall give Distributor any interest in any of them. Distributor
      acknowledges that Altera owns or holds a license to all copyrights,
      patents, trademarks, or trade secrets related to the Products and agrees
      that it will not knowingly at any time during or after this Agreement
      assert or claim any interest in or do anything that may adversely affect
      the validity or enforceability of any copyrights, patents, trademarks, or
      trade secrets owned by or licensed to Altera (including, without
      limitation, any act, or assistance to act, which may infringe or lead to
      the infringement of any copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets
      related to the Products). Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent
      Distributor from challenging the validity of any trademark, copyright, or
      patent. Distributor agrees not to attach any additional trademarks, logos,
      or trade names to any Product. Distributor further agrees not to affix any
      of the Trademarks to any product not manufactured or sold by Altera.

      11.4 No Continuing Rights in Trademarks. Upon expiration or termination of
      this Agreement, Distributor will immediately cease all display,
      advertising and use of all Trademarks and will not thereafter use,
      advertise, or display any name, mark or logo which is, or any part of
      which is, similar to, or confusing with, any Trademark or other name,
      mark, logo or designation associated with any Product.

      11.5 Obligation to Protect Proprietary Information. Altera and Distributor
      have entered into or shall in the future enter into a non-disclosure
      agreement that shall set forth the parties' obligations to protect
      proprietary information.

      11.6 Notification of Suspected Infringement. Distributor agrees to notify
      Altera of any known or suspected infringement of Altera's trademark, trade
      secret, copyright, and patent rights that comes to Distributor's
      attention. Distributor also agrees not to induce, encourage, contribute
      to, or support the infringement of Altera's trademark, trade secret,
      copyright, and

                                                                              12


      patent rights or the breach of the Altera Program License Agreement by
      Distributor's customers or other third parties.

      11.7  Intellectual Property Indemnification.

           (a) Altera shall defend any suit, proceeding, or claim of
      infringement asserted against Distributor in the Territory insofar as such
      suit, proceeding, or claim of infringement alleges that any Product
      manufactured and supplied by Altera to Distributor infringes any duly
      issued patent, registered trademark, or copyright and Altera shall pay all
      damages and costs finally awarded therein against Distributor, provided
      that Altera promptly is informed and furnished a copy of each
      communication, notice or other action relating to the alleged infringement
      and is given authority, information, and assistance (at Altera's expense)
      necessary to defend or settle said suit or proceeding. Altera shall have
      the absolute right to control the defense and settlement of any
      infringement suit or proceeding for which Distributor seeks
      indemnification under this paragraph. Altera shall not be obligated to
      defend or be liable for costs and damages if the infringement arises out
      of (1) Products that are manufactured by Altera in accordance with
      Distributor's specifications, or (2) the Products being combined with or
      added to another product, or (3) the Products being modified after
      delivery to Distributor by Altera (including any programming done by
      Distributor or Distributor's customer), or (4) from use of the Products,
      or any part thereof, in the practice of a process. Altera's obligations
      hereunder shall not apply to any infringement occurring after Distributor
      has received notice of such suit or proceeding alleging the infringement
      unless Altera has given written permission for such use by Distributor.

           (b) If any Product manufactured and supplied by Altera to Distributor
      shall be held by any court in the Territory to infringe any patent,
      registered trademark, or copyright and Distributor shall be enjoined from
      using the same, Altera will at its option and at its expense (1) procure
      for Distributor the right to use such Product free of any liability for
      infringement or (2) replace such Product with non-infringing substitute
      Product or (3) refund the purchase price of such Product.

           (c) If the infringement by Distributor is alleged prior to Altera's
      completion of delivery of the Products, Altera may decline to make further
      shipments without being in breach of this Agreement.

           (d) If any suit, proceeding, or claim of infringement is asserted
      against Altera in the Territory based on a claim that the goods
      manufactured by Altera in compliance with Distributor's specifications and
      supplied to Distributor directly infringe any duly issued patent,
      registered trademark, or copyright, then Distributor shall indemnify
      Altera to the same extent as specified in subparagraph 11.7(a) of this
      Agreement. However, Distributor shall not be obligated to indemnify Altera
      for specifications developed solely by Distributor's end customers.

      PARTIES HERETO FOR PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR COPYRIGHT

      INFRINGEMENT AND IS IN LIEU OF ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR
      STATUTORY, IN REGARD THERETO.

12.   SOFTWARE LICENSE

      Altera grants and Distributor accepts a non-exclusive license to use and
      sublicense Altera Software Products and other copyrighted materials,
      including but not limited to printed materials, on the following terms
      (the "License"):

      12.1 The Software Products covered by this Agreement are confidential and
      proprietary to Altera and its licensors, and Altera and its licensors
      retain all title, copyright, patent and other proprietary rights to the
      Software Products and all copies thereof.

      12.2 Distributor may sublicense Altera Software Products to its customers
      for use in a manner that is not inconsistent with the terms of this
      Agreement. Any sublicense granted to Distributor's customers must be made
      subject to the terms of the Altera Program License Agreement. Any attempt
      by Distributor to sublicense Altera Software Products in contravention of
      this Agreement shall be null and void.

      12.3 Distributor may use Altera Software Products to perform
      demonstrations of the use of Altera Products, or to train sales people in
      the use of Altera Products, or to train customers in the use of Altera
      Products.

      12.4 Distributor may use Altera Software Products to program other Altera
      Products for Distributor's customers. Distributor may not use Altera
      Software Products to program non-Altera Products.

      12.5 Distributor may use a single copy of any Software Product only on a
      single computer or on a single network of workstations.

      12.6 Distributor may make one copy of any Software Product that it has

      Paragraph 12.

      12.7 Except to the extent permitted in the preceding subparagraph,

      decompile or disassemble any Altera Software Product under any
      circumstance without the prior written permission of Altera.

      12.8 Distributor agrees that it will not open any sealed Altera Software
      Products that are intended for sublicensing, nor will it sublicense any
      unsealed Altera Software Products. Distributor will not transfer,
      sublicense, or give away any copy of an Altera Software Product that was
      previously installed on any computer or single network of workstations at
      Distributor's place of business.

      12.9 The terms of this License shall govern with respect to Distributor's
      use of Altera Software products in the event that any such terms are
      inconsistent with or omitted from the Altera Program License Agreement.

13.   CO-OP ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

      Altera shall establish a fund for payment of advertising, promotion, and
      Product literature localization costs ("Co-op Fund") in the Territory
      equal to up to one-half of one percent (1/2%) of the net purchase price of
      all Products purchased by Distributor during the preceding twelve (12)
      months. Funds will be accrued on a 12-month rolling basis, and those funds
      not committed to projects within that period revert to Altera. Specific
      projects may be proposed by either Altera or Distributor, but only
      projects that have been approved in writing by Altera will be eligible for
      payment from the Co-op Fund. 

      If advertising and promotion costs for an approved project are incurred by
      Altera or any of its affiliate companies, Distributor shall reimburse
      Altera for up to one-half of the cost of such project; the exact amount of
      such reimbursement shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties prior to
      implementation of the project. Distributor shall make such payments to
      such entity as may be designated by Altera in writing for the benefit of
      Altera. If advertising and promotion costs for approved projects are
      incurred by Distributor, Altera shall reimburse Distributor for up to
      one-half (1/2) of such costs. Altera shall finally determine the exact
      amount of such reimbursement.

14.   ASSIGNMENT

      This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party without the prior
      written approval of the other party. Except in the case of a corporate
      reorganization, a change in the persons or entities who control fifty
      percent (50%) or more of the equity securities or voting interest of a
      party shall be considered an assignment of that party's rights.

15.   TERM AND TERMINATION

      15.1 Term. This Agreement shall be in force for a period of one (1) year
      from the date of this Agreement, which is indicated above. Thereafter,
      this Agreement shall renew automatically for subsequent periods of one (1)

      subparagraph 15.2 or this Agreement is terminated without notice pursuant
      to subparagraph 15.3.

      15.2 Termination With Notice. At any time, either party may terminate this
      Agreement without cause upon providing the other party with ninety (90)
      days prior written notice.

      under the following circumstances:

      benefit of creditors, or if there are initiated by or

                                                                              15


      against either party proceedings in bankruptcy or under insolvency laws or
      for reorganization, receivership or dissolution, or if either party ceases
      to conduct its operations in the normal course of business, the other
      party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement effective
      immediately upon giving notice.

           (b) If either party is in breach hereof and does not cure such
      breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice thereof.

      15.4 Waiver of Damages in Event of Termination. The right of termination,
      as provided herein, is absolute. Both Altera and Distributor have
      considered the possibility of expenditures necessary in preparing for
      performance of this Agreement and the possible losses and damage incident
      to each in the event of termination, and it is understood that neither
      party shall be liable to the other for damages in any form by reason of
      the termination of this Agreement at any time, other than as expressively
      provided in this Agreement.

      15.5  Procedures Upon Termination.

           (a) Unfilled Orders. Upon termination of this Agreement, Altera may,
      at its option, cancel any or all unfilled orders that were previously
      accepted by Altera pursuant to subparagraph 5.2. Except in those
      circumstances governed by subparagraph 5.6 of the Agreement, Altera agrees
      not to cancel orders which are for Products intended for resale pursuant
      to firm orders (1) that have been placed by a specific customer with
      Distributor and are scheduled for delivery within 90 days of the date that
      notice of termination is given and (2) that Distributor, from among its
      locations, does not have inventory stock to complete. Distributor shall
      notify Altera in writing of such firm orders within 30 days of the date
      that notice of termination is given.

           (b) Promotion. Upon termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees
      to discontinue immediately all activities as an Altera Distributor
      including, without limitation, all use of the Trademarks and all
      advertising of or reference to Altera Products, except as permitted
      pursuant to the disposition of inventory of Products pursuant to
      subparagraph 15.5(c).

           (c) Disposition of Inventory. In the event Altera terminates this
      Agreement without cause pursuant to subparagraph 15.2 or Distributor
      terminates on the ground that Altera has breached the Agreement, Altera
      will repurchase from Distributor at Distributor's option any or all unsold
      non-discontinued and non-obsolete Products in Distributor's inventory at
      the net price paid by Distributor. Products returned under this provision
      are subject to paragraph 9.1. In the event Distributor terminates this
      Agreement without cause or Altera terminates with cause pursuant to
      subparagraph 15.3 above, Altera may, at its option, repurchase from
      Distributor any or all unsold Altera products in Distributor's inventory
      at the same price as set forth in the sentence immediately preceding. The
      party terminating this Agreement shall pay all transportation charges for
      Products returned to Altera.

      Altera's current list of published suggested prices, sales literature,
      books, catalogs, etc. as Altera may prepare for distribution, and shall
      also provide Distributor with such technical and sales assistance as may
      be necessary to assist Distributor in effectively carrying out its
      obligations under this Agreement. Altera reserves the right to sell
      directly to any and all customers.

5.    ORDER PROCEDURE

      5.1 Orders. Distributor will place individual orders for the Products from
      time to time during the term of this Agreement either by means of
      electronic data transmission or in written form. This Agreement shall
      govern to the extent that any terms in this Agreement are inconsistent
      with the terms of any agreement between Altera and Distributor relating to
      electronic data transmission. Each order placed by Distributor will
      contain the following minimum information: (i) identification of each
      Product ordered by Product number, quantity, and price; (ii) shipping
      instructions and destination; and (iii) a requested delivery date for each
      Product.

      5.2 Acceptance by Altera. All orders for the Products by Distributor shall
      be subject to acceptance by Altera and shall not be binding until the
      earlier of such acceptance or shipment, and, in the case of acceptance by
      shipment, only as to the portion of the order actually shipped. Altera
      shall use its reasonable best efforts in completing any open portion of a
      partial shipment of an order. Altera has the right to refuse to accept,
      for any reason, any order placed by Distributor. Altera shall use its
      reasonable best efforts to accept any order for non-custom Products within
      ten (10) days of its receipt.

      5.3 Controlling Terms. The terms of this Agreement will apply to each
      order accepted or shipped by Altera under this Agreement. In the event
      that any terms or conditions of sale contained in any communication
      between Distributor and Altera contradict or are inconsistent with
      anything contained in this Agreement, the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement shall prevail. Altera's acceptance of any order from Distributor
      under this Agreement is conditioned on Distributor agreeing that the terms
      of this Agreement shall prevail over any additional or inconsistent terms
      communicated by Distributor to Altera in any form whatsoever.

      5.4 Quantity. All component orders of custom Products only are subject to
      an overrun or underrun of five percent (5%) of the quantity ordered which
      shall constitute fulfillment of the order by Altera.

      5.5 Change Orders and Cancellation by Distributor.

                                                                               5




           (a) Standard Products: All orders submitted by Distributor and
      accepted by Altera are firm commitments by Distributor to buy Altera
      Products. Distributor will notify Altera in a timely manner of its desire
      to change any order. Altera shall have the right to deny any change order
      request submitted by Distributor within ninety (90) days of the current
      factory scheduled shipment date. However, within the period from thirty
      (30) to ninety (90) days of the current factory scheduled shipment date,
      Altera will use its best efforts to accommodate reasonable requests for
      changes. Within the period from zero (0) to thirty (30) days of current
      factory scheduled shipment date, Altera will accept change orders only in
      extraordinary circumstances; Altera's shall have the sole right to
      determine what circumstances are extraordinary. Altera's acceptance of any
      change order request within 30 days of current factory scheduled shipment
      shall not obligate Altera to accept future change order requests submitted
      within 30 days of shipment. On an ongoing and regular basis, Distributor
      will use its best efforts to reconcile its own records of orders on Altera
      with Altera's records of order backlog.

           (b) Custom Products: From time to time, Distributor may place orders
      on Altera for Custom Product. (Custom Product is defined as Product that
      is not listed in Altera's published distributor price list and/or that
      requires special processing by Altera.) Once accepted by Altera, orders
      for Custom Product may not be changed in any way without prior approval of
      Altera. As a pre-condition to approving a request to change an order for
      Custom Product, Altera may require Distributor to compensate Altera for
      any costs incurred by Altera as a result of the change order.

      5.6 Cancellation by Altera. Altera reserves the right to cancel any orders
      placed by Distributor and accepted by Altera as set forth above, or to
      refuse or delay shipment thereof, if:

           (a) Distributor fails to make any payment as provided in this
      Agreement or under the terms of payment set forth in any invoice or
      otherwise agreed to by Altera and Distributor;

           (b) Distributor fails to meet reasonable credit or financial
      requirements established by Altera, including any limitations on allowable
      credit;

           (c) Distributor otherwise fails to comply with the terms and
      conditions of this Agreement;

           (d) this Agreement is terminated and the scheduled delivery would
      take place after the Agreement's termination date; or

           (e) circumstances beyond Altera's control prevent it from shipping
      any order by the requested delivery date.

           Altera also reserves the right to discontinue the manufacture or
      distribution of any or all of the Products at any time, and to cancel any
      orders for such discontinued Products without liability of any kind to
      Distributor or to any other person except as expressly set forth herein.
      No such discontinuation will be deemed a termination (unless Altera so
      advises Distributor)

                                                                               6


      or breach of this Agreement by Altera. Altera will provide Distributor
      with notice of product discontinuances in accordance with ISO Standards
      Book, 01P-01454-01, as amended or updated.

6.    PAYMENT

      6.1 Terms and Interest. Payment shall be made according to the terms
      specified in writing by Altera. Interest shall be payable at the rate of
      one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month or at the maximum rate permitted
      by law, whichever is less, on all overdue and unpaid invoices. Altera has
      the right to invoice Distributor for any unauthorized discounts or
      deductions taken by Distributor, and Distributor shall make payment on
      such invoices net thirty (30) days.

      6.2 Method of Payment. Distributor shall make payment in Dollars as
      designated by Altera or in such other method as agreed to by the parties
      in writing.

      Altera, all prices quoted by Altera for the Products do not include any
      national, state, or local sales, use, value added or other taxes, customs
      duties, or similar tariffs and fees. Distributor shall be responsible and
      liable for the payment of any taxes, customs duties, or other government
      fees and tariffs applicable to the Products, except for taxes based on
      Altera's net income, unless Distributor has provided Altera with an
      exemption resale certificate in the appropriate form for the jurisdiction
      to which the Products are to be directly shipped. Distributor agrees to
      indemnify Altera for any claim for taxes, customs duties, or other
      government fees and tariffs applicable to the Products that may be levied
      on Altera.

7.    SHIPMENT AND RISK OF LOSS

      7.1 Shipment. Orders issued by the Distributor will specify requested
      shipment dates. Distributor will select the mode of shipment and the
      carrier. Altera will pay for packing costs. Distributor will be
      responsible for and pay all charges for shipping, freight, and any
      insurance requested by Distributor, which charges Altera may require
      Distributor to pay in advance.

      7.2 Delays in Shipment. Altera will use commercially reasonable efforts to
      ship products to arrive by any requested delivery dates quoted or
      acknowledged. However, Altera will not be liable for any delay in shipment
      or delay in performance under this Agreement due to unforeseen
      circumstances or due to causes beyond its control including but not
      limited to, acts of nature, acts of government, labor disputes, delays in
      transportation, and delays in delivery or inability to deliver by Altera's
      suppliers.

      7.3 Risk of Loss. All risk of loss of, or damage to, the Products will
      pass to Distributor, or to such financing institution or other party or
      parties as may have been designated to Altera by Distributor, upon
      delivery by Altera to the carrier, freight forwarder or Distributor,
      whichever first occurs. Distributor will bear the risk of loss or damage
      in transit.

8.    PRICES

      8.1 Altera's Prices. Distributor shall purchase products at Altera's
      prices as are in effect at the time the order is received from the
      Distributor.

      8.2 Price Changes: From time to time, Altera may decide to change the
      prices for the Products.

           (a) Price decreases: In the event of a price decrease by Altera,
      Altera will invoice Distributor at the lower price for all orders placed
      by Distributor that have not been delivered as of the effective date of
      the price decrease.

           (b) Price increases: In the event of a price increase, Altera will
      announce to Distributor its intention to raise prices at least 30 days
      before the effective date of such a price increase. All orders on Altera's
      backlog as of the announcement of the price increase and scheduled for
      delivery by Altera within 30 days of announcement shall be shipped at the
      price that was effective before the price increase. All other orders shall
      ship at the new, increased price. Distributor shall have the right to
      cancel (within ten days of the announcement of a price increase) any
      orders for Product for which Altera has announced a price increase.

      8.3 Credit for Inventory Invoiced at Higher Price. In the event of a price
      decrease, Altera shall issue a credit to Distributor in the amount of the
      price decrease for all unsold Products then stocked by the Distributor
      provided that Distributor satisfies the terms and conditions specified in
      subparagraph 8.4 and 8.5(b) and (c).

      8.4 Record Keeping for Price Decrease Credits. As a condition of Altera
      issuing Distributor a credit pursuant to subparagraph 8.3, Altera must
      receive an inventory report from Distributor no later than thirty (30)
      days after the effective date of the price decrease. No credit will be due
      Distributor if Distributor fails to furnish such inventory report within
      the thirty-day period. Altera shall have the right to audit the
      information provided in this report against the previous inventory reports
      and subsequent resale reports. Altera may conduct such audit upon
      reasonable notice during normal business hours at the Distributor's place
      of business by, among other things, reviewing the Distributor's applicable
      books and records. Upon verification of Distributor's claim for credit,
      Altera shall issue a credit to Distributor's account.

      8.5  Procedure for Submitting Claims for Credit.

           (a) Distributor must submit its claims for the following types of
      credits within sixty days of the following:

                  (i) Price Discrepancies: the date of any invoice that contains
            a price discrepancy; or


<PAGE>   8

                                                                               8

                  (ii) SSD (ship from stock debit): sales out date.

      Altera will not honor any claims for credit submitted after the sixty-day
      period.

           (b) All claims for credit must specify the invoice number(s) to
      which the claim applies.

           (c) If Altera provided Distributor with a discount on its regular
      prices at the time that Altera invoiced Distributor for the Products that
      are the subject of a claim for credit, Altera shall subtract from the
      credit the proportional amount of the prior discount.

9.    STOCK ROTATION AND RETURNS

      9.1 Return of Products. If Altera determines in accordance with its Stock
      Rotation Policy that Distributor's inventory is overstocked with certain
      Products, Distributor may return such Products to Altera pursuant to
      subparagraph 9.2. Products that are obsolete or discontinued may be
      returned pursuant to subparagraph 9.3 of this Agreement. Returns of
      Products that are permitted in connection with the termination of this
      Agreement are subject to paragraph 15. All returns require a Return
      Material Authorization ("RMA").

           Distributor shall bear all risk of loss or damage during shipment of
      returned Products and shall ship returned Products in accordance with
      Altera's reasonable instructions.

             Altera will credit distributor's account in the amount of the net
      price paid by Distributor for the returned Products after Altera receives
      the Products and verifies their quantity and quality. All returned
      Products must be unused, undamaged, and in sealed, factory-shipped boxes.
      Distributor may not take any deductions from payments due to Altera before
      Altera has issued a credit to Distributor; Altera will charge interest at
      the rate of one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month or at the maximum
      rate permitted by law, whichever is less, from the date that Distributor
      makes any unauthorized deductions.

      9.2 Procedure for Stock Rotations. At regular six-month intervals, Altera
      will accept a Stock Rotation return from Distributor for the purpose of
      clearing Distributor's inventory of Product that in Distributor's good
      faith judgment is unlikely to be sold. Under this provision, Distributor
      may return to Altera Product valued at up to 5% of Altera's net billings
      to Distributor for the six months prior to the Stock Rotation. As a
      precondition for accepting a Stock Rotation, Altera may require that
      Distributor take delivery from Altera of Product of value equal to or less
      than the value of the Product returned.

           9.3 Obsolete and Discontinued Products. Altera may render obsolete or
      discontinue the manufacture and/or sale of any Product ("Discontinued
      Product") and shall notify Distributor of any Discontinued Product.
      Distributor shall have the right to return Discontinued Product to Altera.
      Within thirty (30) days of the last date that orders will be accepted,
      Distributor shall notify Altera of Distributor's intention to return any
      Discontinued Product in its inventory which were purchased by Distributor
      from Altera.

      9.4 Administrative Procedures for Returns. Product returns to Altera
      pursuant to subparagraphs 9.2, 9.3, and 15.5(c) as well as any other
      Product returns to Altera are subject to the following provisions:

           (a) Distributor must request and receive from Altera a Return
      Material Authorization number for each return prior to shipping Product to
      Altera. Altera will not unreasonably withhold return Material
      Authorizations.

           (b) Altera retains the right to review all line items prior to return
      and approve or deny any item requested for return by Distributor. Altera
      will establish and publish reasonable requirements not inconsistent with
      the terms hereof for the approval of return line items, and for the
      handling and packaging of Product to be returned, in order to protect the
      quality of Altera Products and minimize the administrative expenses to
      both parties associated with returns.

           (c) Return Material Authorization numbers are valid for 60 days from
      the date of issuance to Distributor. If Distributor fails to return the
      Products within that 60-day period, Altera shall not be obligated to
      accept the Products or to credit Distributor's account for the Products.

      9.5 Defective Products. Defective or non-conforming Products shall be
      subject to the warranty provision of paragraph 10 of this Agreement.

10.   WARRANTIES

      10.1 Altera's Warranties to Distributor.

           (a) Semiconductor Products and Other Hardware Products. Altera
      warrants that the Products (other than Software Products) (hereinafter
      referred to as "Semiconductor Products") covered by this Agreement shall
      be free from defects in materials and workmanship and shall conform to
      Altera's published specifications for a period of up to one year from the
      date of shipment to Distributor's customer but in no event longer than two
      years from the date of shipment by Altera to Distributor. The foregoing
      warranty does not apply to any Semiconductor Products that (i) have not
      been stored, handled, or maintained in accordance with Altera's published
      quality standards and procedures, including those set out in the
      Distributor Policies and Procedures Manual, or (ii) have not been
      programmed in accordance with Altera's published programming standards and
      procedures, including those set out in the Distributor Policies and
      Procedures Manual, or (iii) have otherwise been subject to misuse,
      including static discharge, neglect, accident or modification or (iv) have
      been soldered or altered and are not capable of being tested by Altera
      under its normal test conditions. Altera's sole obligation to Distributor
      for Semiconductor Products failing to meet this warranty shall be to
      replace the defective or non-conforming Semiconductor Products. This
      obligation is conditioned on all of the following: (1) Distributor or
      Distributor's customer providing Altera with written notice of any
      nonconformity or defect within the applicable warranty period, and (2)

      defective Semiconductor Product to Altera within 30 days of receiving
      Altera's written notification to do so, and (3) Altera determining that
      the Semiconductor Product is non-conforming or

      Semiconductor Product. Any replacement of a Semiconductor Product by
      Altera shall carry only the unexpired term of the original warranty.

           (b) Software Products. Altera warrants that Software Products covered
      by this Agreement, when properly installed and used, will perform
      substantially in accordance with Altera's current Software Products
      documentation for a period of up to ninety (90) days from the date of
      shipment to Distributor's customer but in no event longer than one year
      from the date of shipment to Distributor. Altera warrants the diskette(s)
      on which Software Products are furnished to be free from defects in
      materials and workmanship under normal use for a period of up to ninety

      event longer than one year from the date of shipment to Distributor. The
      foregoing warranty does not apply to any Software Products that have been
      damaged as a result of accident, abuse, misuse, neglect, or modification.

      During the warranty period, (1) Altera will replace any Software Product
      or diskette not meeting the foregoing warranty and which is returned to
      Altera; or (2) if Altera is unable to deliver a replacement Software
      Product which performs substantially in accordance with current Software
      Product documentation or a diskette which is free of defects in materials
      or workmanship, Distributor may return the Software Product for a credit
      in the amount paid by Distributor. Any replacement Programs or diskettes
      will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or
      thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.

           (c) THE WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN PARAGRAPH 10 OF THIS AGREEMENT ARE
      THE ONLY WARRANTIES MADE BY ALTERA WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCTS. EXCEPT AS
      PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 10, ALTERA MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
      INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF QUALITY, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. THE WARRANTIES PROVIDED IN
      PARAGRAPH 10 MAY BE MODIFIED OR AMENDED BY ALTERA ONLY BY WRITTEN
      INSTRUMENT SIGNED BY A DULY AUTHORIZED AGENT OF ALTERA.

      10.2 Distributor Shall Make No Inconsistent Warranties. Distributor shall
      make no representation, guarantee or warranty on Altera's behalf to
      Distributor's customers with respect to the Products that is inconsistent
      with the above warranties.

11.   ALTERA'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

      11.1 Trademark Use During Agreement. During the term of this Agreement,
      Distributor is authorized by Altera to use the Trademarks in connection
      with Distributor's advertisement, promotion, and distribution of the
      Products. Distributor shall use the Trademarks only in signs and printed
      material furnished or approved in writing by an authorized representative
      of Altera. Distributor shall not use the Trademarks, or any part thereof,
      separately or in combination, as a part of or in connection with its firm,
      trade, or corporate name. Distributor's use of the Trademarks will be in
      accordance with Altera's policies in effect

<PAGE>   11

                                                                              11


      from time to time, including but not limited to trademark usage and
      co-operative advertising policies.

      11.2 Copyright, Patent, and Trademark Notices. As both a covenant by
      Distributor and a condition of Altera's sale or license of the Products to
      Distributor, Distributor will include on each copy of the Products that it
      distributes, and on all containers and storage media, all copyright,
      patent, trademark, and other notices of proprietary rights included by
      Altera on the Products. Distributor agrees not to alter, erase, deface, or
      overprint any such notice on anything provided by Altera.

      11.3 No Distributor Rights in Altera Intellectual Property Rights.
      Distributor has paid no consideration for the use of Altera's copyrights,
      patents, trademarks, or trade secrets and nothing contained in this
      Agreement shall give Distributor any interest in any of them. Distributor
      acknowledges that Altera owns or holds a license to all copyrights,
      patents, trademarks, or trade secrets related to the Products and agrees
      that it will not knowingly at any time during or after this Agreement
      assert or claim any interest in or do anything that may adversely affect
      the validity or enforceability of any copyrights, patents, trademarks, or
      trade secrets owned by or licensed to Altera (including, without
      limitation, any act, or assistance to act, which may infringe or lead to
      the infringement of any copyrights, patents, trademarks, or trade secrets
      related to the Products). Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent
      Distributor from challenging the validity of any trademark, copyright, or
      patent. Distributor agrees not to attach any additional trademarks, logos,
      or trade names to any Product. Distributor further agrees not to affix any
      of the Trademarks to any product not manufactured or sold by Altera.

      11.4 No Continuing Rights in Trademarks. Upon expiration or termination of
      this Agreement, Distributor will immediately cease all display,
      advertising and use of all Trademarks and will not thereafter use,
      advertise, or display any name, mark or logo which is, or any part of
      which is, similar to, or confusing with, any Trademark or other name,
      mark, logo or designation associated with any Product.

      11.5 Obligation to Protect Proprietary Information. Altera and Distributor
      have entered into or shall in the future enter into a non-disclosure
      agreement that shall set forth the parties' obligations to protect
      proprietary information.

      11.6 Notification of Suspected Infringement. Distributor agrees to notify
      Altera of any known or suspected infringement of Altera's trademark, trade
      secret, copyright, and patent rights that comes to Distributor's
      attention. Distributor also agrees not to induce, encourage, contribute
      to, or support the infringement of Altera's trademark, trade secret,
      copyright, and patent rights or the breach of the Altera Program License
      Agreement by Distributor's customers or other third parties.

      11.7  Intellectual Property Indemnification.

           (a) Altera shall defend any suit, proceeding, or claim of
      infringement asserted against Distributor in the Territory insofar as such
      suit, proceeding, or claim of infringement alleges that any Product
      manufactured and supplied by Altera to Distributor infringes any duly
      issued patent, registered trademark, or copyright and Altera shall pay all
      damages and costs finally awarded therein against Distributor, provided
      that Altera promptly is informed and furnished a copy of each
      communication, notice or other action relating to the alleged infringement
      and is given authority, information, and assistance (at Altera's expense)
      necessary to defend or settle said suit or proceeding. Altera shall have
      the absolute right to control the defense and settlement of any
      infringement suit or proceeding for which Distributor seeks
      indemnification under this paragraph. Altera shall not be obligated to
      defend or be liable for costs and damages if the infringement arises out
      of (1) Products that are manufactured by Altera in accordance with
      Distributor's specifications, or (2) the Products being combined with or
      added to another product, or (3) the Products being modified after
      delivery to Distributor by Altera (including any programming done by
      Distributor or Distributor's customer), or (4) from use of the Products,
      or any part thereof, in the practice of a process. Altera's obligations
      hereunder shall not apply to any infringement occurring after Distributor
      has received notice of such suit or proceeding alleging the infringement
      unless Altera has given written permission for such use by Distributor.

           (b) If any Product manufactured and supplied by Altera to Distributor
      shall be held by any court in the Territory to infringe any patent,
      registered trademark, or copyright and Distributor shall be enjoined from
      using the same, Altera will at its option and at its expense (1) procure
      for Distributor the right to use such Product free of any liability for
      infringement or (2) replace such Product with non-infringing substitute
      Product or (3) refund the purchase price of such Product.

           (c) If the infringement by Distributor is alleged prior to Altera's
      completion of delivery of the Products, Altera may decline to make further
      shipments without being in breach of this Agreement.

           (d) If any suit, proceeding, or claim of infringement is asserted
      against Altera in the Territory based on a claim that the goods
      manufactured by Altera in compliance with Distributor's specifications and
      supplied to Distributor directly infringe any duly issued patent,
      registered trademark, or copyright, then Distributor shall indemnify
      Altera to the same extent as specified in subparagraph 11.7(a) of this
      Agreement. However, Distributor shall not be obligated to indemnify Altera
      for specifications developed solely by Distributor's end customers.

           (e) THE FOREGOING STATES THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE LIABILITY OF THE
      PARTIES HERETO FOR PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND IS IN
      LIEU OF ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, IN REGARD THERETO.

12.   SOFTWARE LICENSE

      Altera grants and Distributor accepts a non-exclusive license to use and
      sublicense Altera Software Products and other copyrighted materials,
      including but not limited to printed materials, on the following terms
      (the "License"):

      12.1 The Software Products covered by this Agreement are confidential and
      proprietary to Altera and its licensors, and Altera and its licensors
      retain all title, copyright, patent and other proprietary rights to the
      Software Products and all copies thereof.

      12.2 Distributor may sublicense Altera Software Products to its customers
      for use in a manner that is not inconsistent with the terms of this
      Agreement. Any sublicense granted to Distributor's customers must be made
      subject to the terms of the Altera Program License Agreement. Any attempt
      by Distributor to sublicense Altera Software Products in contravention of
      this Agreement shall be null and void.

      12.3 Distributor may use Altera Software Products to perform
      demonstrations of the use of Altera Products, or to train sales people in
      the use of Altera Products, or to train customers in the use of Altera
      Products.

      12.4 Distributor may use Altera Software Products to program other Altera
      Products for Distributor's customers. Distributor may not use Altera
      Software Products to program non-Altera Products.

      12.5 Distributor may use a single copy of any Software Product only on a
      single computer or on a single network of workstations.

      12.6 Distributor may make one copy of any Software Product that it has
      installed on a single computer or single network of workstations at
      Distributor's place of business in any computer-readable or printed form
      for back-up or archival purposes only and subject to the terms of this
      Paragraph 12.

      12.7 Except to the extent permitted in the preceding subparagraph,
      Distributor may not copy, modify, revise, alter, reverse engineer,
      decompile or disassemble any Altera Software Product under any
      circumstance without the prior written permission of Altera.

      12.8 Distributor agrees that it will not open any sealed Altera Software
      Products that are intended for sublicensing, nor will it sublicense any
      unsealed Altera Software Products. Distributor will not transfer,
      sublicense, or give away any copy of an Altera Software Product that was
      previously installed on any computer or single network of workstations at
      Distributor's place of business.

      12.9 The terms of this License shall govern with respect to Distributor's
      use of Altera Software products in the event that any such terms are
      inconsistent with or omitted from the Altera Program License Agreement.

13.   CO-OP ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION

      Altera shall establish a fund for payment of advertising, promotion, and
      Product literature localization costs ("Co-op Fund") in the Territory
      equal to up to one-half of one percent (1/2%) of the net purchase price of
      all Products purchased by Distributor during the preceding twelve (12)
      months. Funds will be accrued on a 12-month rolling basis, and those funds
      not committed to projects within that period revert to Altera. Specific
      projects may be proposed by either Altera or Distributor, but only
      projects that have been approved in writing by Altera will be eligible for
      payment from the Co-op Fund.

      If advertising and promotion costs for an approved project are incurred by
      Altera or any of its affiliate companies, Distributor shall reimburse
      Altera for up to one-half of the cost of such project; the exact amount of
      such reimbursement shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties prior to
      implementation of the project. Distributor shall make such payments to
      such entity as may be designated by Altera in writing for the benefit of
      Altera. If advertising and promotion costs for approved projects are
      incurred by Distributor, Altera shall reimburse Distributor for up to
      one-half (1/2) of such costs. Altera shall finally determine the exact
      amount of such reimbursement.

14.   ASSIGNMENT

      This Agreement shall not be assignable by either party without the prior
      written approval of the other party. Except in the case of a corporate
      reorganization, a change in the persons or entities who control fifty
      percent (50%) or more of the equity securities or voting interest of a
      party shall be considered an assignment of that party's rights.

15.   TERM AND TERMINATION

      15.1 Term. This Agreement shall be in force for a period of one (1) year
      from the date of this Agreement, which is indicated above. Thereafter,
      this Agreement shall renew automatically for subsequent periods of one (1)
      year unless notice of termination is served in accordance with
      subparagraph 15.2 or this Agreement is terminated without notice pursuant
      to subparagraph 15.3.

      15.2 Termination With Notice. At any time, either party may terminate this
      Agreement without cause upon providing the other party with ninety (90)
      days prior written notice.

      15.3 Termination For Cause. The Agreement may be terminated without notice
      under the following circumstances:

           (a) If either party is or becomes insolvent or admits its inability
      to pay its debts as they become due, or makes an assignment for the
      benefit of creditors, or if there are initiated by or against either party
      proceedings in bankruptcy or under insolvency laws or for reorganization,
      receivership or dissolution, or if either party ceases to conduct its
      operations in the normal

                                                                              15


      course of business, the other party shall have the right to terminate this
      Agreement effective immediately upon giving notice.

           (b) If either party is in breach hereof and does not cure such
      breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice thereof.

      15.4 Waiver of Damages in Event of Termination. The right of termination,
      as provided herein, is absolute. Both Altera and Distributor have
      considered the possibility of expenditures necessary in preparing for
      performance of this Agreement and the possible losses and damage incident
      to each in the event of termination, and it is understood that neither
      party shall be liable to the other for damages in any form by reason of
      the termination of this Agreement at any time, other than as expressively
      provided in this Agreement.

      15.5  Procedures Upon Termination.

           (a) Unfilled Orders. Upon termination of this Agreement, Altera may,
      at its option, cancel any or all unfilled orders that were previously
      accepted by Altera pursuant to subparagraph 5.2. Except in those
      circumstances governed by subparagraph 5.6 of the Agreement, Altera agrees
      not to cancel orders which are for Products intended for resale pursuant
      to firm orders (1) that have been placed by a specific customer with
      Distributor and are scheduled for delivery within 90 days of the date that
      notice of termination is given and (2) that Distributor, from among its
      locations, does not have inventory stock to complete. Distributor shall
      notify Altera in writing of such firm orders within 30 days of the date
      that notice of termination is given.

           (b) Promotion. Upon termination of this Agreement, Distributor agrees
      to discontinue immediately all activities as an Altera Distributor
      including, without limitation, all use of the Trademarks and all
      advertising of or reference to Altera Products, except as permitted
      pursuant to the disposition of inventory of Products pursuant to
      subparagraph 15.5(c).

           (c) Disposition of Inventory. In the event Altera terminates this
      Agreement without cause pursuant to subparagraph 15.2 or Distributor
      terminates on the ground that Altera has breached the Agreement, Altera
      will repurchase from Distributor at Distributor's option any or all unsold
      non-discontinued and non-obsolete Products in Distributor's inventory at
      the net price paid by Distributor. Products returned under this provision
      are subject to paragraph 9.1. In the event Distributor terminates this
      Agreement without cause or Altera terminates with cause pursuant to
      subparagraph 15.3 above, Altera may, at its option, repurchase from
      Distributor any or all unsold Altera products in Distributor's inventory
      at the same price as set forth in the sentence immediately preceding less
      a five (5%) percent handling charge to be deducted by Altera from any
      credit to be issued to Distributor. The party terminating this Agreement
      shall pay all transportation charges for Products returned to Altera.

16.   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION

      In no event shall either party be liable to the other party for indirect,
      special, incidental, or consequential damages as a result of any claim or
      liability relating to or arising out of this Agreement. Distributor shall

      or relating to Distributor's breach of this Agreement, negligence, or
      wrongful conduct.

17.   RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES

      It is expressly understood and agreed that the relationship between Altera
      and Distributor under this Agreement is solely that of seller and buyer.
      Distributor is an independent contractor and is in no way Altera's legal
      representative or agent. Distributor has no authority to assume or create
      any obligation on behalf of Altera, express or implied, with respect to
      Products or otherwise. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
      construed as a limitation or restriction upon Altera in the sale or other
      disposition of any Product to any person, firm or corporation or in any
      territory or country.

18.   GOVERNING LAW, CHOICE OF FORUM, ATTORNEYS' FEES

      or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties hereby
      agree that the party who does not prevail with respect to any dispute,
      claim, or controversy relating to this Agreement shall pay the costs
      actually incurred by the prevailing party, including any attorneys' fees.

19.   WAIVER

      Either party's failure to enforce at any time any of the provisions of
      this Agreement, or any right with respect thereto, or to exercise any
      option herein provided, shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of
      such provisions, rights or options or in any way affect the validity of
      this Agreement. Either party's exercise of any of its rights hereunder or
      of any options hereunder under the terms or covenants herein shall not
      preclude or prejudice either party from thereafter exercising the same or
      any other right it may have under this Agreement, irrespective of any
      previous action or proceeding taken by either party.

23.   COMPLETE AGREEMENT

      This Agreement supersedes and cancels any previous understanding or
      agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties relating to the
      subject matter hereof, including any existing distribution agreement
      involving Altera semiconductor products. This Agreement supersedes but
