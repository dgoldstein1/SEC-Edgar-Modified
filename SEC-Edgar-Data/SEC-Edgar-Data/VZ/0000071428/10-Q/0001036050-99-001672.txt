                     NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (Unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation

   Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell
Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic). The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange
Commission rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods.  These
financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a fair
presentation of results of operations and financial position for the interim
periods shown including normal recurring accruals. The results for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.  For a more
complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other
information, you should refer to the financial statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998.

   We have reclassified certain amounts from the prior year's data to conform to
the 1999 presentation.

2. Dividend

   On August 2, 1999, we declared and paid a dividend in the amount of $98.1
million to Bell Atlantic.

3. Transfer of Directory Publishing Activities

   On March 1, 1998, we transferred, at net book value without gain or loss,
certain assets and liabilities associated with our directory publishing
activities to a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary. The stock of the newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary was immediately distributed to Bell Atlantic.
The transfer of such assets and liabilities was completed as part of our and
Bell Atlantic's response to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, which prohibits us from engaging in electronic publishing or joint sales
and marketing of electronic products.

   Net assets that we transferred totaled approximately $2 million, and
consisted of deferred directory production costs (included in prepaid expenses),
fixed assets and related deferred tax liabilities.

   Revenues related to the directory publishing activities we transferred were
approximately $47 million for the six months ended June 30, 1998.  Direct
expenses related to the directory publishing activities we transferred were
approximately $18 million for the same period.  We do not separately identify
indirect expenses attributable to the directory publishing activities, including
expenses related to billing and data management and processing services, legal,
external affairs, depreciation, interest expense and any corresponding tax
expense.

   Effective March 1, 1998, we no longer earned revenues from directory
publishing activities that we transferred, and we no longer incurred the related
expenses.  We continue to earn certain other revenues, primarily fees for
nonpublication of telephone numbers and multiple white page listings.
Additionally, contracts between us and another affiliate of Bell Atlantic for
billing and collection services related to the directory activities, use of
directory listings, and rental charges have created new revenues sources for us.

4. New Accounting Standards

Costs of Computer Software

   Effective January 1, 1999, we adopted Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1,
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use." Under SOP No. 98-1, we capitalize the cost of internal-use
software which has a useful life in excess of one year. Subsequent additions,
modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized only to the
extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not
perform. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period in
which they are incurred. Also, we now capitalize interest associated with the
development of internal-use software. The effect of adopting SOP No. 98-1 for
Bell Atlantic was an increase in net income of approximately $115 million for
the six months ended June 30, 1999.

<PAGE>
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

Costs of Start-Up Activities

   Effective January 1, 1999, we adopted SOP No. 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs
of Start-up Activities."  Under this accounting standard, we expense costs of
start-up activities as incurred, including pre-operating, pre-opening and other
organizational costs.  The adoption of SOP No. 98-5 did not have a material
effect on our results of operations or financial condition because we have not
historically capitalized start-up activities.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This statement requires that
all derivatives be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet.  Changes in the fair values of derivative
instruments will be recognized in either earnings or comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use and effectiveness of the instruments.  The FASB
amended this pronouncement in June 1999 to defer the effective date of SFAS No.
133 for one year.

   Under the amended pronouncement, we must adopt SFAS No. 133 no later than
January 1, 2001.  The adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have no material effect on
our results of operations or financial condition because we currently do not
enter into the use of derivative instruments or participate in hedging
activities.

</TABLE>

      Net income and comprehensive income were the same for the six months ended
 June 30, 1999 and 1998.

6. Litigation and Other Contingencies

   Various legal actions and regulatory proceedings are pending to which we are
a party.  We have established reserves for specific liabilities in connection
with regulatory and legal matters that we currently deem to be probable and
estimable.  We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of pending regulatory
and legal matters in future periods will have a material effect on our financial
condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations.

7. Proposed Bell Atlantic  GTE Merger

   Bell Atlantic and GTE Corporation (GTE) have announced a proposed merger of
equals under a definitive merger agreement dated as of July 27, 1998.  Under the
terms of the agreement, GTE shareholders will receive 1.22 shares of Bell
Atlantic common stock for each share of GTE common stock that they own.  Bell
Atlantic shareholders will continue to own their existing shares after the
merger.

   It is expected that the merger will qualify as a pooling of interests, which
means that for accounting and financial reporting purposes the companies will be
treated as if they had always been combined.  At annual meetings held in May
1999, the shareholders of each company approved the merger.  The completion of
the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including certain regulatory
approvals and receipt of opinions that the merger will be tax-free.

   Bell Atlantic and GTE are working diligently to complete the merger at the
earliest practicable date. However, the companies must obtain the approval of a
variety of state and federal regulatory agencies and, accordingly, the merger
may close in the first half of 2000.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
         (Abbreviated Pursuant to General Instruction H(2).)

   This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements
and Notes to Financial Statements.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

   We reported net income of $301.7 million for the six months ended June 30,
1999, compared to net income of $263.3 million for the same period in 1998.

   Our results for 1999 and 1998 were affected by special items.  The special
items in both periods include our allocated share of charges from Bell Atlantic
Network Services, Inc. (NSI).  Results for 1998 also included the effect of
transferring certain assets and liabilities of our directory publishing
activities to a subsidiary, as described below.

   The following table shows how special items are reflected in our condensed
statements of income for each period:

Merger-related Costs

   In connection with the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger, which was completed in
August 1997, we recorded pre-tax transition and integration costs of $4.9
million in the first six months of 1999 and $5.1 million in the first six months
of 1998.

   Transition and integration costs consist of our proportionate share of costs
associated with integrating the operations of Bell Atlantic and NYNEX, such as
systems modifications costs and advertising and branding costs.  Transition and
integration costs are expensed as incurred.

Transfer of Directory Publishing Activities

   On March 1, 1998, we transferred, at net book value without gain or loss,
certain assets and liabilities associated with our directory publishing
activities to a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary. The stock of the newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary was immediately distributed to Bell Atlantic.
The transfer of such assets and liabilities was completed as part of our and
Bell Atlantic's response to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of
1996 (1996 Act), which prohibits us from engaging in electronic publishing or
joint sales and marketing of electronic products.

   Net assets that we transferred totaled approximately $2 million, and
consisted of deferred directory production costs (included in prepaid expenses),
fixed assets and related deferred tax liabilities.

   Revenues related to the directory publishing activities we transferred were
approximately $47 million for the six months ended June 30, 1998.  Direct
expenses related to the directory publishing activities we transferred were
approximately $18 million for the same period.  We do not separately identify
indirect expenses attributable to the directory publishing activities, including
expenses related to billing and data management and processing services, legal,
external affairs, depreciation, interest expense and any corresponding tax
expense.

   Effective March 1, 1998, we no longer earned revenues from directory
publishing activities that we transferred, and we no longer incurred the related
expenses.  We continue to earn certain other revenues, primarily fees for
nonpublication of telephone numbers and multiple white page listings.
Additionally, contracts between us and another affiliate of Bell Atlantic for
billing and collection services related to the directory activities, use of
directory listings, and rental charges have created new revenue sources for us.

LOCAL SERVICES REVENUES

   1999 - 1998                       Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                   $45.3         5.9%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Local services revenues are earned from the provision of local exchange,
local private line, public telephone (pay phone) and value-added services.
Value-added services are a family of services that expand the utilization of the
network.  These services include products such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and
Return Call.

   Growth in local services revenues in 1999 was primarily due to higher usage
of our network facilities. This growth was generated, in part, by an increase in
access lines in service of 4.5% from June 30, 1998, and strong growth in message
volumes.  Access line growth primarily reflects higher demand for Centrex
services and an increase in additional residential lines.

   Local services revenue growth in 1999 also reflects strong customer demand
and usage of our data transport and digital services.  Revenues from our value-
added services were boosted in 1999 by marketing and promotional campaigns
offering new service packages.

   Growth in local services revenues was partially offset by a decline in
revenues from our pay phone services, due to the increasing popularity of
wireless communications.  In addition, the resale of access lines and the
provision of unbundled network elements to competitive local exchange carriers
reduced revenues in 1999.

NETWORK ACCESS SERVICES REVENUES

   1999 - 1998                       Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                   $51.3        8.8%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Network access services revenues are earned from end-user subscribers and
long distance and other competing carriers who use our local exchange facilities
to provide usage services to their customers. Switched access revenues are
derived from fixed and usage-based charges paid by carriers for access to our
local network. Special access revenues originate from carriers and end-users
that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks.
End-user access revenues are earned from our customers and from resellers who
purchase dial-tone services.

   Network access services revenue growth in 1999 was mainly attributable to
higher customer demand, as reflected by growth in access minutes of use of 8.0%
from the same period in 1998.  Volume growth also reflects a continuing
expansion of the business market, particularly for high-capacity services.  In
1999, demand for special access services increased, reflecting a greater
utilization of our network. Higher network usage by alternative providers of
intraLATA toll services and higher end-user revenues attributable to an increase
in access lines in service also contributed to revenue growth in 1999.

   Volume-related growth was partially offset by net price reductions mandated
by a federal price cap plan.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
regulates the rates that we charge long distance carriers and end-user
subscribers for interstate access services.  We are required to file new access
rates with the FCC each year under the rules of the Price Cap Plan.

   In July 1999, we implemented interstate price decreases of approximately $4
million on an annual basis in connection with the FCC's Price Cap Plan.  The
rate changes include amounts necessary to recover our contributions to the FCC's
universal service fund, which are included in Other Operating Expenses.  The FCC
has created a multi-billion dollar interstate fund to link schools and libraries
to the Internet and to subsidize low-income customers and rural health care
providers.  Under the FCC's rules, all providers of interstate
telecommunications services must contribute to the universal service fund.
Contributions to the schools and libraries fund have been assessed based on
total interstate and intrastate retail revenues.  As described in Other Matters
- - FCC Regulation and Interstate Rates - Universal Service, the U.S. Court of
Appeals recently reversed the decision to include intrastate revenues in the
calculation of contributions to the schools and libraries fund. It also reversed
the decision to require local telephone companies to recover their universal
service contributions through access charges rather than charges to their end-
user customers. Our rates are subject to change every quarter due to potential
increases or decreases in our contribution to the universal service fund. The
July 1999 rate changes include an annual increase of approximately $12 million
in the required contributions to this fund. These rates will be in effect
through June 2000. Interstate price decreases were $14 million on an annual
basis for the period July 1998 through June 1999. These rates were increased by
approximately $8 million on an annual basis for the period January 1999 through
June 1999 to reflect primarily the unification of pre-merger Bell Atlantic and
NYNEX access rates.


LONG DISTANCE SERVICES REVENUES

   1999 - 1998                      (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                  $(8.6)         (3.3)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Long distance services revenues are earned primarily from calls made to
points outside a customer's local calling area, but within our service area
(intraLATA toll).  Other long distance services that we provide include 800
services, Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS), and corridor services (between
LATAs in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and between LATAs in northern New
Jersey and New York City).

   The decline in long distance services revenues was principally caused by the
competitive effects of presubscription for intraLATA toll services.
Presubscription permits customers to use an alternative provider of their choice
for intraLATA toll calls without dialing a special access code when placing a
call.  In response to presubscription, we have implemented customer win-back and
retention initiatives that include toll calling discount packages and product
bundling offers.  These revenue reductions were partially offset by additional
revenues generated from higher calling volumes.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                  $(37.0)       (19.9)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Our ancillary services include such services as billing and collections for
long distance carriers and affiliates, collocation by competitive local exchange
carriers, usage of separately priced (unbundled) components of our network by
competitive local exchange carriers, facilities rentals to affiliates and
nonaffiliates, voice messaging, customer premises equipment (CPE) and wiring and
maintenance services, and sales of materials and supplies to affiliates.

   As described earlier, we transferred certain assets and liabilities
associated with our directory publishing activities to a newly formed, wholly
owned subsidiary, effective March 1, 1998.  As a result, we no longer earn
revenues associated with the directory publishing activities transferred.
Beginning March 1, 1998, our ancillary services revenues include directory
services revenues earned primarily from fees paid by customers for
nonpublication of telephone numbers and multiple white page listings and fees
paid by an affiliate for usage of our directory listings.

   The decrease in ancillary services revenues in 1999 was principally due to
the effect of the transfer of directory publishing activities and the
recognition in 1998 of revenues associated with a marketing program.

   These revenue decreases were partially offset by increased demand for billing
and collection services and higher payments from competitive local exchange
carriers for interconnection of their network with our network. Growth in voice
messaging services revenues and higher facilities rental revenues from
affiliates in 1999 also offset decreases in ancillary services revenues, but to
a lesser extent.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                   $(5.5)        (1.6)%

   Employee costs consist of salaries, wages and other employee compensation,
employee benefits and payroll taxes paid directly by us.  Similar costs incurred
by employees of NSI, who provide centralized services on a contract basis, are
allocated to us and are included in Other Operating Expenses.

   Employee costs decreased in the first six months of 1999 primarily as a
result of lower pension and benefit costs and the effect of lower work force
levels.  Annual salary and wage increases for management and associate employees
substantially offset these cost reductions.

   The decline in pension and benefit costs was due to a number of factors,
principally, lower pension costs as a result of favorable pension plan
investment returns and changes in plan provisions and actuarial assumptions.
These factors were partially offset by increased health care costs caused by
inflation and benefit plan improvements provided for under new contracts with
associate employees.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                   $19.5         5.5%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the first six months of
1999 over the same period in 1998 principally as a result of growth in
depreciable telephone plant and changes in the mix of plant assets.  The
adoption of Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of
Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" also contributed to
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in the first six months of
1999, but to a lesser extent.  Under this new accounting standard, computer
software developed or obtained for internal use is now capitalized and
amortized.  Previously, we expensed most of these software purchases as
incurred.  For additional information on SOP No. 98-1, see Note 4 to the
condensed financial statements.  These expense increases were partially offset
by the effect of lower rates of depreciation.


OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

   1999 - 1998                      (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                  $(28.1)        (4.7)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Other operating expenses consist of contract services including centralized
services expenses allocated from NSI, rent, network software costs, operating
taxes other than income, the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable,
and other costs.

   As a result of the transfer of directory publishing activities in March 1998,
we no longer incur certain direct and allocated expenses related to the
activities that we transferred.

   The decrease in other operating expenses in the first six months of 1999 was
largely attributable to the transfer of directory publishing activities and the
effect of adopting SOP No. 98-1.  Other items contributing to the decline in
other operating expenses, but to a lesser extent, were a reduction in the
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable and lower centralized services
expenses allocated from NSI, primarily as a result of lower employee costs
incurred by NSI.

   These decreases were partially offset by higher property taxes and contracted
services and by higher interconnection payments to competitive local exchange
and other carriers to terminate calls on their networks (reciprocal
compensation). Certain competitive local exchange carriers with which we have
interconnection agreements have requested payment for "reciprocal compensation"
to terminate calls on their networks, including a large volume of one-way
traffic from our customers to internet service providers that are their
customers. In February 1999, the FCC confirmed that such traffic is largely
interstate but concluded that it would not interfere with state regulatory
decisions requiring payment of reciprocal compensation for such traffic and that
carriers are bound by their existing interconnection agreements. The FCC
tentatively concluded that future compensation arrangements for calls to
Internet service providers should be negotiated by carriers and arbitrated, if
necessary, before the state commissions under the terms of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act). The FCC has initiated a proceeding to
consider, alternatively, the adoption of federal rules to govern future inter-
carrier compensation for this traffic. We have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals
to review the FCC's decision that state commissions may require payment of
reciprocal compensation for this traffic. The New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities recently decided that, in view of the FCC decision, Internet-bound
traffic is interstate and reciprocal compensation does not apply.

   Six Months                   $(1.5)       (51.7)%

   The change in other income, net, was attributable to the recognition of
interest income in connection with the settlement of tax-related matters in 1998
and lower interest income from our short-term investments.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Six Months                    $1.3        2.5%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Interest expense includes costs associated with borrowings and capital
leases, net of interest capitalized as a cost of acquiring or constructing plant
assets.

   Interest expense increased in the first six months of 1999 over the same
period in 1998 principally due to a reduction in capitalized interest costs
primarily resulting from lower levels of average telephone plant under
construction.  This increase was partially offset by the effect of lower
interest rates on average short-term debt.


EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES

   Six Months Ended June 30
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1999                           40.6%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1998                           40.9%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The effective income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a
percentage of income before the provision for income taxes.  Our effective
income tax rate was lower in the first six months of 1999 principally due to
non-recurring income tax benefits recorded in 1999.


FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

   We use the net cash generated from operations and from external financing to
fund capital expenditures for network expansion and modernization, and pay
dividends.  While current liabilities exceeded current assets at both June 30,
1999 and 1998 and December 31, 1998, our sources of funds, primarily from
operations and, to the extent necessary, from readily available financing
arrangements with an affiliate, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating
requirements. Management expects that presently foreseeable capital requirements
will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds.
Additional long-term debt may be needed to fund development activities or to
maintain our capital structure to ensure financial flexibility.

   As of June 30, 1999, we had $305.8 million of an unused line of credit with
an affiliate, Bell Atlantic Network Funding Corporation.  In May 1999, we
increased our shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission for the issuance of unsecured debt securities from $50.0 million to
$350 million.  Our debt securities continue to be accorded high ratings by
primary rating agencies.  Subsequent to the announcement of the Bell
Atlantic - GTE merger, rating agencies have maintained current credit ratings,
but have placed our ratings under review for potential downgrade.

   Our debt ratio was 48.2% at June 30, 1999, compared to 49.9% at June 30, 1998
and 48.5% at December 31, 1998.

   On August 2, 1999, we declared and paid a dividend in the amount of $98.1
million to Bell Atlantic.



OTHER MATTERS

FCC Regulation and Interstate Rates

   Price Caps

   In May 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the FCC's establishment of a
6.5% productivity factor in calculating the annual price cap index applied to
our interstate access rates. The court directed the FCC to reconsider and
explain the methods used in selecting the productivity factor. The court granted
the FCC a stay of its order, however, until April 1, 2000. As a result, our
annual price cap filing effective July 1, 1999 includes the effects of the FCC's
6.5% productivity factor (see Operating Revenues - Network Access Services).

   Universal Service

   On July 30, 1999, the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed certain aspects of the
FCC's universal service order.  While the court generally upheld the FCC's rules
creating a fund to support service to schools and libraries, it reversed that
portion of the rules that included intrastate revenues as part of the basis for
assessing contributions to that fund.  The court also reversed the portion of
the FCC's order that required local telephone companies to recover their
universal service contributions generally through increases to their interstate
access revenues, rather than through charges directly to their end-user
customers.

Recent Accounting Pronouncement - Derivatives and Hedging Activities

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This statement requires that all
derivatives be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet.  Changes in the fair values of the derivative
instruments will be recognized in either earnings or comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use and effectiveness of the instruments. The FASB
amended this pronouncement in June 1999 to defer the effective date of SFAS No.
133 for one year.

   Under the amended pronouncement, we must adopt SFAS No. 133 no later than
January 1, 2001.  The adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have no material effect on
our results of operations or financial condition because we currently do not
enter into the use of derivative instruments or participate in hedging
activities.


Year "2000" Update

   Bell Atlantic has a comprehensive program to evaluate and address the impact
of the Year 2000 date transition on its subsidiaries' operations, including our
operations.  This program includes steps to:

   .  inventory and assess for Year 2000 compliance our equipment, software and
      systems;
   .  determine whether to remediate, replace or retire noncompliant items, and
      establish a plan to accomplish these steps;
   .  remediate, replace or retire the items;
   .  test the items, where required; and
   .  provide management with reporting and issues management to support a
      seamless transition to the Year 2000.

State of Readiness

   For Bell Atlantic's operating telephone subsidiaries, centralized services
   entities and general corporate operations, the program focuses on the
   following project groups: Network Elements, Applications and Support Systems,
   and Information Technology Infrastructure.  Bell Atlantic's goal for these
   operations was to have its network and other mission critical systems Year
   2000 compliant (including testing) by June 30, 1999 and it has substantially
   met this goal. What follows is a more detailed breakdown of Bell Atlantic's
   efforts to date.

 .  Network Elements

   Approximately 350 different types of network elements (such as central office
   switches) appear in over one hundred thousand instances. When combined in
   various ways and using network application systems, these elements are the
   building blocks of customer services and networked information transmission
   of all kinds. Bell Atlantic originally assessed approximately 70% of these
   element types, representing over 90% of all deployed network elements, as
   Year 2000 compliant. As of July 31, 1999, Bell Atlantic has completed the
   repair/replacement for approximately 99% of deployed network elements
   requiring remediation. Bell Atlantic's plan is to remediate/replace or where
   applicable retire, the remaining elements prior to August 31, 1999, with the
   following exceptions: two element types which are planned for
   remediation/replacement in September, and a single switch in New York which,
   under an agreement with the New York Public Service Commission, is scheduled
   to be retired later this year.

 .  Application and Support Systems

   Bell Atlantic has approximately 1,200 application and systems that support:
   (i) the administration and maintenance of its network and customer service
   functions (network information systems); (ii) customer care and billing
   functions; and (iii) human resources, finance and general corporate
   functions. Bell Atlantic originally assessed approximately 48% of these
   application and support systems as either compliant or to be retired. As of
   July 31, 1999, Bell Atlantic has successfully completed repair/replacement of
   more than 99% of all mission critical application and support systems. The
   remaining systems are
                                       13
<PAGE>

                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   scheduled for remediation/replacement or retirement prior to August 31, 1999,
   with the exception of certain accounting subsystems scheduled for replacement
   in October 1999.

 .  Information Technology Infrastructure

   Approximately 40 mainframe, 1,000 mid-range, and 90,000 personal computers,
   related network components, and software products comprise Bell Atlantic's
   information technology (IT) infrastructure.  Of the approximately 1,350
   unique types of elements in the inventory for the IT infrastructure, Bell
   Atlantic originally assessed approximately 73% as compliant or to be retired.
   As of July 31, 1999, Bell Atlantic has successfully completed
   remediation/replacement of all mission critical elements.

   Bell Atlantic's project to remediate/replace or retire mission critical
systems supporting buildings and other facilities used by its operating
telephone subsidiaries, such as HVAC, access control and alarm systems, is now
complete and its efforts to remediate/replace or retire any other Bell Atlantic
mission critical system used by those subsidiaries are virtually complete, with
only a small number of such systems still requiring attention. Work on these few
miscellaneous systems is expected to be completed by the end of September.
Remediation/replacement or retirement of non-mission critical systems, where
applicable, and supplemental testing and verification/correction activities, for
both mission critical and non-mission critical systems, are likely to continue
throughout the balance of 1999.


Third Party Issues

 .  Vendors

   In general, Bell Atlantic's product vendors have made available either Year
   2000-compliant versions of their offerings or new compliant products as
   replacements of discontinued offerings. The compliance "status" of a given
   product is typically determined using multiple sources of information,
   including Bell Atlantic's own internal testing and analysis. However, in some
   instances certification is based on detailed test results or similar
   information provided by the product vendor and analysis by Bell Atlantic or
   contractors specializing in this type of review. Bell Atlantic is also
   continuing Year 2000-related discussions with utilities and similar services
   providers. Although Bell Atlantic has received assurances and other
   information suggesting that substantially all of its primary services
   providers have completed or are well along in their respective Year 2000
   projects, Bell Atlantic does not usually have sufficient access to or control
   over the providers' systems and equipment to undertake verification efforts
   as to such systems and equipment, and as a general matter, it would be
   impractical to do so. Bell Atlantic has also participated in interoperability
   testing of various mission critical network elements, purchased from a number
   of vendors, through the Telco Year 2000 Forum, an industry group comprised of
   leading local telecommunications services companies. Bell Atlantic intends to
   monitor critical service provider activities, as appropriate, through the
   completion of their respective remediation projects.

 .  Customers

   Bell Atlantic's customers remain keenly interested in the progress of its
   Year 2000 efforts, and it anticipates increased demand for information,
   including detailed testing data and company-specific responses.  Bell
   Atlantic is providing limited warranties of Year 2000 compliance for certain
   new telecommunications services and other offerings, but it does not expect
   any resulting warranty costs to be material.

 .  Interconnecting Carriers

   Bell Atlantic's network operations interconnect with domestic and
   international networks of other carriers. If one of these interconnecting
   carrier networks should fail or suffer adverse impact from a Year 2000
   problem, Bell Atlantic's customers could experience impairment of service.
   Bell Atlantic has participated in various internetworking testing efforts, as
   a member of the Association for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS),
   the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and the
   International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Bell Atlantic intends to
   monitor the activities of the primary interconnecting carriers through the
   completion of their respective remediation projects.

   Costs

   From the inception of Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 project through June 30,
1999, and based on the cost tracking methods it has historically applied to this
project, Bell Atlantic has incurred total pre-tax expenses of approximately $180
million, and it has made capital expenditures of approximately $116 million. For
1999, Bell Atlantic expects to incur total pre-tax expenses

                                       14
<PAGE>

                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

for its Year 2000 project of approximately $75 million to $150 million
(approximately $58 million of which was incurred through June 30, 1999) and
total capital expenditures of $75 million to $125 million (approximately $36
million of which was incurred through June 30, 1999). Bell Atlantic anticipates
that the balance of the costs incurred for 1999 will be primarily attributable
to additional testing and verification/correction, rollover transition
management, contingency planning and repair/replacement of non-mission critical
systems. These cost estimates should not be used as the sole gauge of progress
on its Year 2000 project or as an indication of Year 2000 readiness.

   Risks

   The failure to correct a material Year 2000 problem could cause an
interruption or failure of certain of Bell Atlantic's normal business functions
or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations, liquidity or financial condition; however, it considers such a
likelihood remote. Due to the uncertainty inherent in other Year 2000 issues
that are ultimately beyond Bell Atlantic's control, including, for example, the
final Year 2000 readiness of its suppliers, customers, interconnecting carriers,
and joint venture and investment interests, it is unable to determine at this
time the likelihood of a material impact on its results of operations, liquidity
or financial condition due to such Year 2000 issues. However, Bell Atlantic is
taking appropriate prudent measures to mitigate that risk. Bell Atlantic
anticipates that, in the event of material interruption or failure of its
service resulting from an actual or perceived Year 2000 problem within or beyond
its control, it could be subject to third party claims.

   Contingency Plans

   As a public telecommunications carrier, Bell Atlantic has had considerable
experience successfully dealing with natural disasters and other events
requiring contingency planning and execution.  Bell Atlantic's Year 2000
contingency plans are built upon its existing Emergency Preparedness and
Disaster Recovery plans.

   Bell Atlantic will continue to fine-tune and test its corporate Year 2000
contingency plans to help ensure that core business functions and key support
processes will continue to function without material disruption, in the event of
external (e.g. power, public transportation, water), internal or supply chain
failures (i.e. critical dependencies on another entity for information, data or
services). Bell Atlantic's individual business unit contingency plans for Year
2000 are being integrated and coordinated under an enterprise wide command and
control structure.
