                    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (Unaudited)
                                        
1.   Basis of Presentation
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic). The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange
Commission rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These
financial statements reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair
presentation of results of operations and financial position for the interim
periods shown including normal recurring accruals. The results for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. For a more
complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other
information, refer to the financial statements included in the Company's 1997
Form 10-K.

     The Company has reclassified certain amounts from prior year's data to
conform with the 1998 presentation.

2.   Dividend
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On May 1, 1998, the Company declared and paid a dividend in the amount of $93.4
million to Bell Atlantic.

3.   Transfer of Directory Publishing Activities
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On March 1, 1998, the Company transferred, at net book value without gain or
loss, certain assets and liabilities associated with its directory publishing
activities to a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary. The stock of the
subsidiary was immediately distributed to Bell Atlantic. The transfer of such
assets and liabilities was completed as part of Bell Atlantic's and the
Company's response to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
which prohibits the Company from engaging in electronic publishing or joint
sales and marketing of electronic products.

     Net assets transferred by the Company totaled approximately $2 million, and
consisted of deferred directory production costs (included in prepaid expenses),
fixed assets and related deferred tax liabilities.

     Revenues related to the Company's directory publishing activities
transferred were approximately $47 million and $75 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Direct expenses related to the
directory publishing activities transferred were approximately $18 million and
$33 million for the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The Company does not separately identify indirect expenses attributable to the
directory publishing activities, including expenses related to billing and data
management and processing services, legal, external affairs, depreciation,
interest expense and any corresponding tax expense.

4.   Litigation and Other Contingencies
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Various legal actions and regulatory proceedings are pending to which the
Company is a party. The Company has established reserves for liabilities in
connection with regulatory and legal matters which it currently deems to be
probable and estimable. The Company does not expect that the ultimate resolution
of these matters in future periods will have a material effect on the Company's
financial position, but it could have a material effect on results of
operations.

5.   Recent Accounting Pronouncement
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued
Statement of Position No. 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software
Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," (SOP 98-1). The Company is required to
adopt SOP 98-1 effective January 1, 1999, although earlier adoption is
permitted. SOP 98-1 provides, among other things, guidance for determining
whether computer software is for internal use and when the cost related to such
software should be expensed as incurred or capitalized and amortized. The
Company is currently evaluating the provisions of SOP 98-1 and has not yet
determined what the impact of adopting this statement will be on its future
results of operations or financial position.

     (Abbreviated pursuant to General Instruction H(2).)

     This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements
and Notes to Financial Statements.


- -----------------------------
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- -----------------------------

     The Company reported net income of $144.2 million for the three month
period ended March 31, 1998, compared to net income of $153.6 million for the
same period in 1997.

Transfer of Directory Publishing Activities

     On March 1, 1998, the Company transferred, at net book value without gain
or loss, certain assets and liabilities associated with its directory publishing
activities to a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary. The stock of the
subsidiary was immediately distributed to Bell Atlantic. The transfer of such
assets and liabilities was completed as part of Bell Atlantic's and the
Company's response to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
which prohibits the Company from engaging in electronic publishing or joint
sales and marketing of electronic products.

     Net assets transferred by the Company totaled approximately $2 million, and
consisted of deferred directory production costs (included in prepaid expenses),
fixed assets and related deferred tax liabilities.

     Revenues related to the Company's directory publishing activities
transferred were approximately $47 million and $75 million for the three months
ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Direct expenses related to the
directory publishing activities transferred were approximately $18 million and
$33 million for the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.
The Company does not separately identify indirect expenses attributable to the
directory publishing activities, including expenses related to billing and data
management and processing services, legal, external affairs, depreciation,
interest expense and any corresponding tax expense.

     Effective March 1, 1998, revenues from directory publishing activities
transferred are no longer earned, and the related expenses are no longer
incurred, by the Company.  Certain other revenues, primarily fees for
nonpublication of telephone numbers and multiple white page listings continue to
be earned by the Company.  Additionally, contracts between the Company and
another affiliate of Bell Atlantic for billing and collection services related
to the directory activities, use of directory listings, and rental charges have
created new revenue sources for the Company.

     These and other items affecting the comparison of the Company's results of
operations for the three month periods ended March 31, 1998 and 1997 are
discussed in the following sections.  This Management's Discussion and Analysis
should also be read in conjunction with the Company's 1997 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

LOCAL SERVICES REVENUES

     1998-1997                             Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter              $30.2                   8.8%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Local services revenues are earned by the Company from the provision of
local exchange, local private line, public telephone (pay phone) and value-added
services. Value-added services are a family of services which expand the
utilization of the network. These services include products such as Caller ID,
Call Waiting and Return Call.

     Higher usage of the Company's network facilities was the primary reason for
the increase in local services revenues in the first quarter of 1998. This
growth was generated by an increase in access lines in service of 5.8% from
March 31, 1997, and higher business message volumes. Access line growth reflects
primarily higher demand for Centrex services and an increase in additional
residential lines. Higher revenues from private line and switched data services
also contributed to the revenue growth in the first quarter of 1998.

     The Company also recognized higher revenues from public telephone and 
value-added services. Value-added services revenues grew principally as a result
of higher customer demand and usage, while price increases for usage of the
Company's pay phones were the principal reason for the improvement in public
telephone services revenues.


NETWORK ACCESS SERVICES REVENUES

     1998-1997                             Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter              $13.6                   5.0%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Network access services revenues are earned from carriers for their use of
the Company's local exchange facilities in providing usage services to their
customers.  In addition, end-user subscribers pay flat rate access fees to
connect to the Company's network.

     Network access services revenues grew in the first quarter of 1998
primarily as a result of higher customer demand as reflected by growth in access
minutes of use of 14.3% from March 31, 1997. Volume growth was boosted by the
expansion of the business market, particularly for high-capacity services.
Demand for special access services grew as Internet service providers and other
high-capacity users increased their utilization of the Company's network. Growth
in access revenues also reflects higher network usage by alternative providers
of intraLATA toll services. In addition, higher end-user revenues attributable
to an increase in access lines in service contributed to revenue growth in the
first quarter of 1998.

     Volume-related growth was partially offset by net price reductions mandated
by a federal price cap plan. Price decreases of approximately $71 million
annually were implemented under the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC)
Interim Price Cap Plan, effective July 1, 1997. An additional price reduction of
$4.8 million was implemented in December 1997, following the resolution of
certain issues previously under review by the FCC. The rates included in the
1997 filings will be in effect through June 1998. In addition, effective January
1, 1998, the Company increased its annual rates to recover contributions that it
owes to the new universal service fund. These revenues are being entirely offset
by the universal service fund contribution amount, which 

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

is included in Other Operating Expenses. Under an FCC order, all providers of
telecommunications services must contribute to a universal service fund. The new
rules create a multi-billion dollar interstate fund for linking schools and
libraries to the Internet and subsidizing low-income consumers and rural health
care providers. Finally, the Company increased certain end-user subscriber line
rates, effective January 1, 1998, as ordered by the FCC.


LONG DISTANCE SERVICES REVENUES

     1998-1997                          (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter               $(35.9)          (21.6)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Long distance services revenues are earned primarily from calls made
outside a customer's local calling area, but within the same service area of the
Company (intraLATA toll). Other long distance services that the Company provides
include 800 services, Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS), and corridor services
(between LATAs in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and between LATAs in
northern New Jersey and New York City).

     Long distance services revenues declined in the first quarter of 1998 due
to increased competition for intraLATA toll services as a result of the
introduction of presubscription in May 1997. Presubscription permits customers
to use an alternative provider of their choice for intraLATA toll calls without
dialing a special access code when placing a call. Toll message volumes declined
by 16.6% from March 31, 1997, principally as a result of presubscription. The
adverse impact on revenues as a result of presubscription was partially
mitigated by increased network access services revenues for usage of the
Company's network from these alternative providers. Long distance services
revenues were also negatively affected by customers switching to discount
calling plans.


ANCILLARY SERVICES REVENUES

     1998-1997                           Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter                   $1.4        2.2%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The Company provides ancillary services which include billing and
collection services provided to long distance carriers and affiliates, customer
premises equipment (CPE) services, facilities rental services for affiliates and
nonaffiliates, sales of materials and supplies to affiliates and voice messaging
services.

     Ancillary services revenues grew in the first quarter of 1998 as a result
of increased demand by long distance carriers and affiliates for billing and
collection services and increased market penetration for voice messaging
services, principally Home Voice Mail. These revenue increases were partially
offset by a reduction in sales of materials to an affiliate.


DIRECTORY AND INFORMATION SERVICES  REVENUES

     1998-1997                          (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter               $(26.9)          (33.4)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     As described earlier, the Company transferred certain assets and
liabilities associated with its directory publishing activities to a newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary, effective March 1, 1998. As a result, revenues
associated with directory publishing activities transferred are no longer earned
by the Company. Beginning March 1, 1998, the Company's directory and information
services revenues are earned primarily from fees for nonpublication of telephone
numbers, multiple white page listings and usage of directory listings.

     The decrease in directory and information services revenues in the first
quarter of 1998 was principally due to the effect of the transfer of directory
publishing activities. This decrease was partially offset by higher revenues
earned from an affiliate for the usage of the Company's directory listings.

EMPLOYEE COSTS

     1998-1997                          (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter                $(2.0)          (1.2)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Employee costs consist of salaries, wages and other employee compensation,
employee benefits and payroll taxes paid directly by the Company.  Similar costs
incurred by employees of Bell Atlantic Network Services, Inc. (NSI), who provide
centralized services on a contract basis, are allocated to the Company and are
included in Other Operating Expenses.

     Employee costs decreased in the first quarter of 1998 primarily as a result
of lower pension and benefit costs.  The reduction in pension and benefit costs
was caused by a number of factors, including changes in actuarial assumptions,
favorable pension plan asset returns and lower than expected medical claims.  A
decline in repair and maintenance activity further reduced employee costs.
These cost reductions were substantially offset by annual salary and wage
increases for management and associate employees, the effect of higher work
force levels and an increase in overtime pay.

     Associate employee wages and pension and other employee benefits are
determined under contracts ratified by the Communications Workers of America
(CWA) and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), the unions
representing associate employees of the Company.  The contract with the CWA will
expire in August 1998.


DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

     1998-1997                          (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter                 $(.6)          (.3)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in the first quarter of
1998 over the same period in 1997 principally due to the effect of lower rates
of depreciation and amortization. This decrease was substantially offset by
additional expense resulting from growth in depreciable telephone plant.


TAXES OTHER THAN INCOME

     1998-1997                          (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter               $(23.0)          (44.4)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Taxes other than income consist principally of taxes for gross receipts,
property, capital stock and business licenses.

     The decrease in taxes other than income was largely attributable to the
enactment of a New Jersey tax law that repealed the gross receipts tax
applicable to telephone companies and extended the net-income-based corporate
business tax to include telephone companies formerly subject to the gross
receipts tax.  This state tax law change, which became effective on January 1,
1998, resulted in the reduction of gross receipts tax of approximately $18
million in the first three months of 1998. This reduction was offset by the
recognition of state income taxes of approximately $22 million attributable to
the enactment of the law.

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter                 $(.4)          (.2)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Other operating expenses consist of contract services including centralized
services expenses allocated from NSI, rent, network software costs, the
provision for uncollectible accounts receivable, and other costs.

     As a result of the transfer of directory publishing activities, certain
direct and allocated expenses related to the activities transferred are no
longer incurred by the Company.

     The decrease in other operating expenses was largely attributable to the
transfer of directory publishing activities and lower centralized services
expenses allocated from NSI.  The decline in centralized services expenses was
primarily caused by a reduction in pension and benefit costs incurred by NSI.
These decreases were substantially offset by higher costs for network software
purchases, contract services from an affiliate for labor and material and the
Company's contribution to the federal universal service fund, as described
earlier.


OTHER INCOME, NET

     1998-1997                           Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter                          $.6
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The change in other income, net, was attributable to additional interest
income primarily resulting from the purchase of short-term investments to pre-
fund a trust for the payment of certain employee benefits.


INTEREST EXPENSE

     1998-1997                           Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     First Quarter                   $2.2        9.0%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Interest expense increased in the first quarter of 1998 principally as a
result of higher levels of average short-term debt. This increase was partially
offset by higher capitalized interest costs resulting from higher levels of
average telephone plant under construction.


EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES

     Three Months Ended March 31
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1998                                    40.6%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1997                                    34.9%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     The effective income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a
percentage of income before the provision for income taxes.  The Company's
effective income tax rate was higher in the first quarter of 1998 principally as
a result of the recognition of state income taxes caused by the aforementioned
change in the state tax law in New Jersey.

FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

     The Company uses the net cash generated from operations and from external
financing to fund capital expenditures for network expansion and modernization,
and pay dividends.  While current liabilities exceeded current assets at both
March 31, 1998 and 1997 and December 31, 1997, the Company's sources of funds,
primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary, from readily available
financing arrangements with an affiliate, are sufficient to meet ongoing
operating requirements. Management expects that presently foreseeable capital
requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated
funds.  Additional long-term debt may be needed to fund development activities
or to maintain the Company's capital structure to ensure financial flexibility.

     As of March 31, 1998, the Company had $200.3 million of an unused line of
credit with an affiliate, Bell Atlantic Network Funding Corporation.  In
addition, the Company had $50.0 million remaining under a shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of
unsecured debt securities.

     The Company's debt ratio was 48.2% as of March 31, 1998, compared to 46.3%
as of March 31, 1997 and 50.7% as of December 31, 1997.

     On May 1, 1998, the Company declared and paid a dividend in the amount of
$93.4 million to Bell Atlantic.
