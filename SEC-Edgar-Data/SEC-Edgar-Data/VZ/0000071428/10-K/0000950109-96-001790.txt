                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                                    GENERAL

   Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. (the "Company") is incorporated under the
laws of the State of New Jersey and has its principal offices at 540 Broad
Street, Newark, New Jersey 07101 (telephone number 201-649-9900).  The Company
is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic Corporation ("Bell Atlantic"),
which is one of the seven regional holding companies ("RHCs") formed in
connection with the court-approved divestiture (the "Divestiture"), effective
January 1, 1984, of those assets of  American Telephone and Telegraph Company
("AT&T") related to exchange telecommunications, exchange access functions,
printed directories and cellular mobile communications.

   The Company presently serves a territory consisting of three Local Access and
Transport Areas ("LATAs").  These LATAs are generally centered on a city or
based on some other identifiable common geography and, with certain limited
exceptions, each LATA marks the boundary within which the Company has
historically been permitted to provide telephone service.

   The Company currently provides two basic types of telecommunications
services.  First, the Company transports telecommunications traffic between
subscribers located within the same LATA ("intraLATA service"), including both
local and toll services.  Local service includes the provision of local exchange
("dial tone"), local private line and public telephone services (including dial
tone service for pay telephones owned by the Company and other pay telephone
providers).  Among other local services provided are Centrex (telephone company
central office-based switched telephone service enabling the subscriber to make
both intercom and outside calls) and a variety of special and custom calling
services.  Toll service includes message toll service (calling service beyond
the local calling area) within LATA boundaries, and intraLATA Wide Area Toll
Service (WATS)/800 services (volume discount offerings for customers with highly
concentrated demand).  The Company also earns toll revenue from the provision of
telecommunications service between LATAs ("interLATA service") in the corridors
between the cities (and certain surrounding counties) of (i) New York, New York
and Newark, New Jersey and (ii) Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Camden, New
Jersey.  Second, the Company provides exchange access service, which links a
subscriber's telephone or other equipment to the transmission facilities of
interexchange carriers which, in turn, provide interLATA service to their
customers.  The Company also provides exchange access service to interexchange
carriers which provide intrastate intraLATA long distance telecommunications
service.


      LINE OF BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1996

   The consent decree entitled "Modification of Final Judgment" ("MFJ") approved
by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the "D.C.
District Court") which, together with the Plan of Reorganization ("Plan")
approved by the D.C. District Court, set forth the terms of Divestiture also
established certain restrictions on the post-Divestiture activities of the RHCs,
including Bell Atlantic and its subsidiaries.  The MFJ's principal restrictions
on post-Divestiture RHC activities included prohibitions on (i) providing
interexchange telecommunications, and (ii) engaging in the manufacture of
telecommunications equipment and customer premises equipment ("CPE").

   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the "Act") became effective on February
8, 1996 and replaces the MFJ.  In general, the Act includes provisions that
would open the Company's local exchange markets to competition and would permit
local exchange carriers, such as the Company, to provide interLATA services
(long distance) and video programming and to engage in manufacturing.  However,
the ability of the Company to engage in businesses previously prohibited by the
MFJ is largely dependent on satisfying certain conditions contained in the Act
and regulations to be promulgated thereunder.  For a brief discussion of certain
provisions of the Act, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations - Factors That May Impact Future Results, Federal Legislation" on
pages 14 and 15.

                                   OPERATIONS

   During 1993, Bell Atlantic reorganized certain functions formerly performed
by each of the seven Bell System operating companies ("BOCs") transferred to it
pursuant to the Divestiture, including the Company (collectively, the "Network
Services Companies"), into lines of business ("LOBs") organized across the
Network Services Companies around specific market segments.  The Network
Services Companies, however, remain responsible within their respective service
areas for the provision of telephone services, financial performance and
regulatory matters.  The LOBs are:

   The Consumer Services LOB markets communications services to residential
       -----------------                                                   
customers within the service territories of the Network Services Companies,
including the service territory of the Company.

   The Carrier Services LOB markets (i) switched and special access to the
       ----------------                                                   
Company's local exchange network, and (ii) billing and collection services,
including recording, rating, bill processing and bill rendering.  The principal
customers of this LOB are interexchange carriers; AT&T is the largest single
customer.  Other customers include business customers and government agencies
with their own special access network connections, wireless companies and other
local exchange carriers ("LECs") which resell network connections to their own
customers.

   The Small Business Services LOB markets communications and information
       -----------------------                                           
services to small businesses (customers having up to 20 access lines).

   The Large Business Services LOB markets communications and information
       -----------------------                                           
services to large businesses (customers having more than 20 access lines).
These services include voice switching/processing services (e.g., dedicated
private lines, custom Centrex, call management and voice messaging), end-user
networking (e.g., credit and debit card transactions, and personal computer-
based conferencing, including data and video), internetworking (establishing
links between the geographically disparate networks of two or more companies or
within the same company), network integration (integrating multiple
geographically disparate networks into one system), network optimization
(disaster avoidance, 911, intelligent vehicle highway systems), video services
(distance learning, telemedicine, videoconferencing) and interactive multi-media
applications services.

   The Directory Services LOB manages the provision of (i) advertising and
       ------------------                                                 
marketing services to advertisers, and (ii) listing information (e.g., White
Pages and Yellow Pages).  These services are currently provided primarily
through print media, but the Company expects that use of electronic formats will
increase in the future.  In addition, the Directory Services LOB manages the
provision of photocomposition, database management and other related products
and services to publishers.

   The Public and Operator Services LOB markets pay telephone and operator
       ----------------------------                                       
services in the service territories of the Network Services Companies to meet
consumer needs for accessing public networks, locating and identifying network
subscribers, providing calling assistance and arranging billing alternatives
(e.g., calling card, collect and third party calls).

   The Federal Systems LOB markets communications and information technology and
       ---------------                                                          
services to departments, agencies and offices of the executive, judicial and
legislative branches of the federal government.

   The Network LOB manages the technologies, services and systems platforms
       -------                                                             
required by the other LOBs and the Network Services Companies, including the
Company, to meet the needs of their respective customers, including switching,
feature development and on-premises installation and maintenance services.


                      FCC REGULATION AND INTERSTATE RATES

   The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications
Commission ("FCC") with respect to interstate services and certain related
matters.  The FCC prescribes a uniform system of accounts for telephone
companies, interstate depreciation rates and the principles and standard
procedures used to separate plant investment, expenses, taxes and reserves
between those applicable to interstate services under the jurisdiction of the
FCC and those applicable to intrastate services under the jurisdiction of the
respective state regulatory authorities ("separations procedures").  The FCC
also prescribes procedures for allocating costs and revenues between regulated
and unregulated activities.

                                       2
<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   The FCC has prescribed structures for exchange access tariffs to specify the
charges ("access charges") for use and availability of the Company's facilities
for the origination and termination of interstate interLATA service.  In
general, the tariff structures prescribed by the FCC provide that interstate
costs which do not vary based on usage ("non-traffic sensitive costs") are
recovered from subscribers through flat monthly charges ("subscriber line
charges"), and from interexchange carriers through usage-sensitive Carrier
Common Line ("CCL") charges.  Traffic-sensitive interstate costs are recovered
from carriers through variable access charges based on several factors,
primarily usage.

   Price Caps

   The price cap system, which became effective in 1991, (the "Prior Price Cap
Plan") placed a cap on overall LEC prices for interstate access services which
was modified annually, in inflation-adjusted terms, by a fixed percentage which
was intended to reflect increases in productivity.  The price cap level could
also be adjusted to reflect "exogenous" changes, such as changes in FCC
separations procedures or accounting rules.  Under the Prior Price Cap Plan, the
Company was required to share with customers in the form of prospective rate
reductions a portion of its earnings above a certain authorized rate of return.

   In March 1995, the FCC approved an Interim Price Cap Plan ("Interim Plan")
for interstate access charges, which became effective on August 1, 1995, and
replaced the Prior Price Cap Plan.

   Under the Interim Plan, the Company's price cap index must be adjusted by an
inflation index (GDP-PI), less a fixed percentage, either 4.0%, 4.7% or 5.3%,
which is intended to reflect increases in productivity ("Productivity Factor").
Companies selecting the 4.0% or 4.7% Productivity Factor are required to reduce
future prices and share a portion of their interstate return in excess of
12.25%.  Companies selecting the 5.3% Productivity Factor are also required to
reduce prices but are not required to share a portion of their future interstate
earnings.  The Interim Plan also provided for a reduction in the price cap index
of 2.8% to adjust for what the FCC believes was an underestimate in its
calculation of the Productivity Factor in prior years.  The Interim Plan also
eliminated the recovery of certain "exogenous" cost changes, including changes
in accounting costs that the FCC believes have no economic consequences.

   In May 1995, Bell Atlantic selected the 5.3% Productivity Factor for the
August 1995 to June 1996 tariff period. The rates included in the May 1995
filing resulted in price decreases totaling approximately $87.8 million on an
annual basis. These price decreases included the scheduled expiration of a
temporary rate increase of approximately $28.2 million on an annualized basis
that was in effect from March 17, 1995 through July 31, 1995 to recover prior
years "exogenous" postemployment benefit costs.  Approximately 80% of the
remaining $59.6 million reduction resulted from compliance with the Interim
Plan.  The remaining 20% represented reductions that the Company was required to
make under the Prior Price Cap Plan.

   Bell Atlantic appealed the Interim Price Cap Order to the Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit, and that case is currently pending.

   FCC Cost Allocation and Affiliate Transaction Rules

   FCC rules govern: (i) the allocation of costs between the regulated and
unregulated activities of a communications common carrier and (ii) transactions
between the regulated and unregulated affiliates of a communications common
carrier.

   The cost allocation rules apply to certain unregulated activities: activities
that have never been regulated as communications common carrier offerings and
activities that have been preemptively deregulated by the FCC.  The costs of
these activities are removed prior to the separations procedures process and are
assigned to unregulated activities in the aggregate, not to specific services,
for pricing purposes.  Other activities must be accounted for as regulated
activities, and their costs are subject to separations procedures.

   The affiliate transaction rules govern the pricing of assets transferred to
and services provided by affiliates.  These rules generally require that assets
be transferred between affiliates at "market price", if such price can be
established through a tariff or a prevailing price actually charged to third
parties.  In the absence of a tariff or prevailing price, "market price" cannot
be established, in which case (i) asset transfers from a regulated to an
unregulated affiliate must be valued at the higher of cost or fair market value,
and (ii) asset transfers from an unregulated to a regulated affiliate must be
valued at the lower of cost or fair market value.

                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   The FCC has not attempted to make its cost allocation or affiliate
transaction rules preemptive. State regulatory authorities are free to use
different cost allocation methods and affiliate transaction rules for intrastate
ratemaking and to require carriers to keep separate allocation records.

 
                  STATE REGULATION AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

   The communications services of the Company are subject to regulation by the
New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (the "BPU") with respect to intrastate
rates and services and certain other matters.

   The New Jersey Telecommunications Act of 1992 authorized the BPU to adopt
alternative regulatory frameworks to address changes in technology and the
structure of the telecommunications industry and to promote economic
development.  It also deregulated services which the BPU found to be
competitive.  Pursuant to that legislation, the Company filed a Plan for
Alternative Form of Regulation (the "NJPAR"), which became effective with
modifications required by the BPU in May 1993.

   The NJPAR divides the Company's services into Rate-Regulated Services and
Competitive Services.  Rate-Regulated Services are grouped in two categories:

  -"Protected Services": Basic residence and business service, Touch-Tone,
  access services, message toll services and the ordering, installation and
  restoration of these services.  Rates for Protected Services, other than basic
  residence service, may be increased in an amount limited to the prior year's
  increase in the Gross National Product-Price Index ("GNP-PI") less a 2%
  productivity offset, as long as the return on equity for Rate-Regulated
  Services does not exceed 11.7%.  Basic residence service rates are capped
  through December 1999.  However, revenue neutral rate restructuring for Rate-
  Regulated Services, including Protected Services and basic residence service,
  is permitted.

  -"Other Services": Custom Calling, Custom Local Area Signaling Services
  ("CLASS" services which utilize Signaling System 7), operator services and 911
  enhanced service.  Rates for Other Services may be increased beginning January
  1996 in an amount limited to the prior year's increase in the GNP-PI less a 2%
  productivity offset, as long as the return on equity for Rate-Regulated
  Services does not exceed 12.7%.

   All earnings above a return on equity of 13.7% for Rate-Regulated Services
will be shared equally with customers.  There is no point at which the earnings
are capped.  Competitive Services are deregulated under the New Jersey
Telecommunications Act.  An appeal of the NJPAR is pending.

COMPETITION

   General

   Regulatory changes, as well as new technology, are continuing to expand the
types of available communications services and equipment and the number of
competitors offering such services.  An increasing amount of this competition is
from large companies which have substantial capital, technological and marketing
resources.  For a discussion of competition in the local exchange and intraLATA
toll markets, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
- - Factors That May Impact Future Results" on pages 14 and 15.

   Alternative Access

   A substantial portion of the Company's revenues from business and government
customers is derived from a relatively small number of large, multiple-line
subscribers.

   The Company faces competition from alternative communications systems,
constructed by large end users, interexchange carriers and alternative access
vendors, which are capable of originating and/or terminating calls without the
use of the Company's plant. Teleport Communications Group Inc. ("Teleport") and
MFS Communications Company, Inc. ("MFS") provide competitive access service in
the Princeton-Trenton corridor and northern New Jersey.

                                       4
<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   The ability of such alternative access providers to compete with the Company
has been enhanced by the FCC's orders requiring the Company to offer virtual
collocated interconnection for special and switched access services.

   Other potential sources of competition are cable television systems, shared
tenant services and other non-carrier systems which are capable of bypassing the
Company's local plant, either partially or completely, through substitution of
special access for switched access or through concentration of
telecommunications traffic on fewer of the Company's lines.

   Personal Communications Services

   Radio-based personal communications services ("PCS") also constitute
potential sources of competition to the Company.  PCS consists of wireless
portable telephone services which would allow customers to make and receive
telephone calls from any location using small handsets, and which could also be
used for data transmission.

   Directories

   The Company continues to face significant competition from other providers of
directories, as well as competition from other advertising media.  In
particular, the former sales representative of several of the Network Services
Companies publishes directories in competition with those published by the
Company in its service territory.

   Public Telephone Services

   The Company faces increasing competition in the provision of pay telephone
services from other pay telephone service providers.  In addition, the growth of
wireless communications negatively impacts usage of public telephones.

   Operator Services

   Alternative operator services providers have entered into competition with
the Company's operator services product line.


                      CERTAIN CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS

   Certain planning, marketing, procurement, financial, legal, accounting,
technical support and other management services are provided on behalf of the
Company on a centralized basis by Bell Atlantic's wholly owned subsidiary, Bell
Atlantic Network Services, Inc. ("NSI").  Bell Atlantic Network Funding
Corporation provides short-term financing and cash management services to the
Company.

   The seven RHCs each own (directly or through subsidiaries) a one-seventh
interest in Bell Communications Research, Inc. ("Bellcore").  Pursuant to the
Plan, Bellcore furnishes the RHCs and their BOC subsidiaries with technical
assistance such as network planning, engineering and software development, as
well as various other consulting services that can be provided more effectively
on a centralized basis.  Bellcore is the central point of contact for
coordinating the efforts of the RHCs in meeting the national security and
emergency preparedness requirements of the federal government. It also helps to
mobilize the combined resources of the RHCs in times of natural disasters.


                                   EMPLOYEES

   As of December 31, 1995, the Company had approximately 12,800 employees.
This workforce is augmented by employees of the centralized staff of NSI, who
perform services for the Company on a contract basis.

   "Central office equipment" consists of switching equipment, transmission
equipment and related facilities.  "Cable, wiring and conduit" consists
primarily of aerial cable, underground cable, conduit and wiring.  "Land and
buildings" consists of land owned in fee and improvements thereto, principally
central office buildings.  "Other equipment" consists of public telephone
terminal equipment and other terminal equipment, poles, furniture, office
equipment, and vehicles and other work equipment.  "Other" property consists
primarily of plant under construction, capital leases and leasehold
improvements.

   The Company's customers are served by electronic switching systems that
provide a wide variety of services.  The Company's network is in a transition
from an analog to a digital network, which provides the capabilities to furnish
advanced data transmission and information management services.  At December 31,
1995, approximately 80% of the access lines were served by digital capability.


                              CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

   The Company has been making and expects to continue to make significant
capital expenditures to meet the demand for communications services and to
further improve such services.  Capital expenditures were approximately $590
million in 1993, $629 million in 1994 and $604 million in 1995.  The total
investment in plant, property and equipment was approximately $8.38 billion at
December 31, 1993, $8.70 billion at December 31, 1994, and $8.98 billion at
December 31, 1995, in each case after giving effect to retirements, but before
deducting accumulated depreciation at such date.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

   PRE-DIVESTITURE CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND LITIGATION

   The Plan provides for the recognition and payment by AT&T and the former BOCs
(including the Company) of liabilities that are attributable to pre-Divestiture
events but do not become certain until after Divestiture.  These contingent
liabilities relate principally to litigation and other claims with respect to
the former Bell System's rates, taxes, contracts and torts (including business
torts, such as alleged violations of the antitrust laws).  Except to the extent
that affected parties otherwise agree, contingent liabilities that are
attributable to pre-Divestiture events are shared by AT&T and the BOCs in
accordance with formulas prescribed by the Plan, whether or not an entity was a
party to the proceeding and regardless of whether an entity was dismissed from
the proceeding by virtue of settlement or otherwise.  Each company's allocable
share of liability under these formulas depends on several factors, including
the type of contingent liability involved and each company's relative net
investment as of the effective date of Divestiture.  Under the formula generally
applicable to most of the categories of these contingent liabilities, the
Company's aggregate allocable share of liability is approximately 2.8%.

   AT&T and various of its subsidiaries and the BOCs (including, in some cases,
the Company) have been and are parties to various types of litigation relating
to pre-Divestiture events, including actions and proceedings involving
environmental claims and allegations of violations of equal employment laws.
Damages, if any, ultimately awarded in the remaining actions relating to pre-
Divestiture events could have a financial impact on the Company whether or not
the Company is a defendant since such damages will be treated as contingent
liabilities and allocated in accordance with the allocation rules established by
the Plan.

   Effective in 1994, the Company and the other Regional Holding Companies
agreed to discontinue sharing of new pre-Divestiture claims and certain existing
claims other than claims relating to environmental matters.  AT&T is not a party
to this agreement.

   While complete assurance cannot be given as to the outcome of any contingent
liabilities or litigation, in the opinion of the Company's management, any
monetary liability or financial impact to which the Company would be subject
after final adjudication of all of the remaining potential or actual pre-
Divestiture claims would not be material in amount to the financial position of
the Company.

   This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements
and Notes to the Financial Statements included in the index set forth on page 
F-1.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

   The Company reported net income of $496.2 million in 1995, compared to a loss
of $140.7 million in 1994.

   In 1994, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $44.9 million, in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits" (Statement No. 112), to recognize the Company's
proportionate share of benefit costs for the separation of employees who are
entitled to benefits under preexisting Bell Atlantic separation pay plans.
Results for 1994 also included noncash, after-tax extraordinary charges of
$589.7 million in connection with the Company's decision to discontinue
application of regulatory accounting principles required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation" (see Note 2 to the Financial Statements) and $6.7 million
for the early extinguishment of debt.

   These and other items affecting the comparison of operating results between
1995 and 1994 are discussed in the following sections.

</TABLE>

LOCAL SERVICE REVENUES

   DOLLARS IN MILLIONS                          INCREASE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1995 - 1994                              $ 33.7      4.0%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Local service revenues are earned by the Company from the provision of local
exchange, local private line and public telephone services.

   Local service revenues increased primarily due to a 3.6% growth in network
access lines in service.


NETWORK ACCESS REVENUES

   DOLLARS IN MILLIONS                          INCREASE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1995 - 1994                              $ 67.3      7.4%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Network access revenues are received from interexchange carriers (IXCs) for
their use of the Company's local exchange facilities in providing long distance
services to IXCs' customers and from end-user subscribers.  Switched access
service revenues are derived from usage-based charges paid by IXCs for access to
the Company's network.  Special access revenues arise from access charges paid
by IXCs and end-users who have private networks.  End-user access revenues are
earned from local exchange carrier customers who pay for access to the network.

   Network access revenues increased principally due to higher customer demand
for access services as reflected by growth of 9.5% in access minutes of use.
Higher revenues from affiliated companies pursuant to an interstate revenue
sharing agreement and higher end-user revenues attributable to increases in
access lines in service also contributed to revenue growth in 1995.  Revenues in
1995 were positively impacted by a temporary rate increase that was in effect
from March 17, 1995 through July 31, 1995 to recover prior years "exogenous"
postemployment benefit costs.

   Revenue growth from volume increases was partially offset by the effect of
price reductions under the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Price Cap
Plans.

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   In March 1995, the FCC adopted an order approving an Interim Price Cap Plan
for interstate access charges, which replaced the prior Price Cap Plan.  As
required by the FCC's order, Bell Atlantic filed its Transmittal of Interstate
Rates, which resulted in price decreases for the Company totaling approximately
$87.8 million on an annual basis, effective August 1, 1995. These price
decreases included the scheduled expiration of a temporary rate increase of
approximately $28.2 million on an annualized basis that was in effect from March
17, 1995 through July 31, 1995 to recover prior years "exogenous" postemployment
benefit costs.  Also as part of the filing, Bell Atlantic selected a 5.3%
Productivity Factor, which eliminates the requirement to share a portion of
interstate overearnings related to the August 1995 to June 1996 tariff period.

   While the Company expects current volume growth trends to continue, the
impact of the August 1, 1995 price decreases is expected to substantially offset
volume-related growth during the first half of 1996, relative to 1995 network
access revenues.


TOLL SERVICE REVENUES

   DOLLARS IN MILLIONS                         (DECREASE)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1995 - 1994                             $ (41.8)    (5.7)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Toll service revenues are earned from calls made outside a customer's local
calling area, but within the same service area boundaries of the Company,
commonly referred to as Local Access and Transport Areas (LATAs).  Other toll
services include 800 services, Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS) and corridor
services (between southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and northern New Jersey
and New York City).

   The reduction in toll service revenues was caused by a decline in toll
message volumes of 1.7% and company-initiated price reductions on certain toll
services.  The decrease in toll messages was due primarily to increased
competition for intraLATA toll, WATS, private line and corridor services,
including the July 1994 introduction of intraLATA toll services competition on
an access code basis.  Price reductions were implemented on certain toll
services as part of the Company's competitive response.

   The Company expects that competition for toll service revenues will continue
in 1996.  See "Factors That May Impact Future Results" below for a further
discussion of toll service revenue issues.

DIRECTORY PUBLISHING REVENUES

   DOLLARS IN MILLIONS                         (DECREASE)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Directory publishing revenues are earned primarily from local advertising and
marketing services provided to businesses in White and Yellow Pages directories.
Other directory publishing services include database and foreign directory
marketing.

   Directory publishing revenues decreased due to lower advertising volumes
resulting from competition from other directory companies as well as other
advertising media, and the effect of a change in billing procedures in 1994.
This decrease was partially offset by increased revenues resulting from higher
rates charged for advertising services.


OTHER ANCILLARY SERVICES REVENUES

   DOLLARS IN MILLIONS                         (DECREASE)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1995 - 1994                             $ (16.0)   (11.3)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Other ancillary services include billing and collection services provided to
IXCs and facilities rental services provided to affiliates and non-affiliates.

<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   Other ancillary services revenues decreased primarily due to a reduction in
billing and collection services revenues as a result of the elimination of
certain services from a contract with an IXC.  Also contributing to the decline
in other ancillary services revenues was a decrease in facilities rental
revenues and the elimination of intraLATA toll compensation coincident with the
July 1994 commencement of intraLATA toll competition.


VALUE-ADDED SERVICES REVENUES

   DOLLARS IN MILLIONS                          INCREASE
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1995 - 1994                             $  20.0      4.7%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Value-added services represent a family of services which expand the
utilization of the network.  These services include recent products such as
voice messaging services, Caller ID and Return Call as well as more mature
products such as Centrex, Touch-Tone, and customer premises wiring and
maintenance services.

   Continued growth in the network customer base (access lines) and higher
demand by customers for certain value-added central office and voice messaging
services offered by the Company increased value-added services revenues in 1995.
These increases were partially offset by a reduction in contract billing for
certain advanced premises services for large business customers.  Such premises
services, which were primarily performed by the Company until May 1994, are now
contracted with another affiliate of Bell Atlantic.

   Employee costs consist of salaries, wages and other employee compensation,
employee benefits and payroll taxes paid directly by the Company.  Similar costs
incurred by employees of Bell Atlantic Network Services, Inc. (NSI), who provide
centralized services on a contract basis, are allocated to the Company and are
included in other operating expenses.

   The decrease in employee costs was principally due to the effect of a third
quarter 1994 charge of $35.4 million to recognize benefit costs, in accordance
with Statement No. 112, for the separation of employees who are entitled to
benefits under preexisting Bell Atlantic separation pay plans.  Benefit costs
associated with the separation of employees of NSI were allocated to the Company
and included in other operating expenses.  Decreased overtime pay, the effect of
lower workforce levels and a reduction in pension cost further reduced employee
costs in 1995.  These cost reductions were partially offset by annual salary and
wage increases and the recognition of certain contract labor and separation pay
costs in 1995 associated with a new five-year labor contract with the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the contract
settlement with the Communications Workers of America (CWA).

                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   In June 1995, the Company executed a contract with the IBEW, representing
approximately 7,400 employees.  The IBEW contract, which became effective May
21, 1995, provided for a 14.5% wage increase over the five-year contract period,
a ratification bonus, improved benefits and pensions, and certain employment
security provisions.  The base wage increases in the second and third years were
modified in a revised agreement, dated March 6, 1996, to total 17.4% over the
five years.

   The Company's contract with the CWA, representing approximately 4,200
employees, expired on August 5, 1995. In January 1996, a tentative three-year
labor agreement was reached, which was subsequently ratified in February 1996.
The agreement includes a 10.6% wage increase over the three-year contract
period, a ratification bonus, improved pensions and benefits, and certain
employment security provisions.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Depreciation and amortization increased due to higher depreciation rates and
growth in depreciable telephone plant.  The composite depreciation rates were
7.9% in 1995 and 7.7% in 1994.


OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

   1995 - 1994                             $  10.7       .9%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Other operating expenses consist primarily of contract services including
centralized services expenses allocated from NSI, rent, network software costs,
operating taxes other than income, provision for uncollectible accounts
receivable and other costs.

   The increase in other operating expenses was attributable to higher
centralized services costs allocated from NSI, primarily as a result of
additional costs incurred in that organization to enhance systems, consolidate
work activities and market value-added services at Bell Atlantic's network
services subsidiaries.

   This increase was substantially offset by a reduction in the provision for
uncollectibles, principally as a result of a lower level of fraudulent calling
card toll calls in 1995.  The effect of a third quarter 1994 charge for the
Company's allocated share of separation benefit costs associated with employees
of NSI also partially offset the increase in other operating expenses.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The change in other income and (expense), net was attributable to the
elimination of the allowance for funds used during construction.  Upon the
discontinued application of regulatory accounting principles, effective August
1, 1994, the Company began recognizing capitalized interest costs as a reduction
of interest expense.  Previously, the Company recorded an allowance for funds
used during construction as an item of other income.  This reduction was offset,
in part, by the recognition of interest income related to short-term
investments.

   Interest expense decreased principally due to the recognition of increased
capitalized interest costs, subsequent to the discontinued application of
regulatory accounting principles, effective August 1, 1994.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The Company's effective income tax rate was higher in 1995 principally due to
the reduction in the amortization of investment tax credits and the elimination
of the benefit of the income tax rate differential applied to reversing timing
differences, both as a result of the discontinued application of regulatory
accounting principles in August 1994.

   A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective
income tax rate for each period is provided in Note 8 to the Financial
Statements.


FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT FUTURE RESULTS
- --------------------------------------

   FEDERAL LEGISLATION

   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the Act), which became effective on
February 8, 1996, is the most comprehensive revision of the federal
communications laws in over 60 years.  In general, the Act includes provisions
that would open the Company's local exchange markets to competition and would
permit local exchange carriers, such as the Company, upon meeting certain
conditions, to provide interLATA services (long distance) and video programming
and to engage in manufacturing.

   With regard to the rules governing competition in the interLATA market, the
Act takes a two-fold approach. Effective February 8, 1996, Bell Atlantic is
permitted to apply for approval to offer interLATA services outside of the
geographic region in which it currently operates as a local exchange carrier.
Bell Atlantic has announced its plans to offer such services in several states.

   Secondly, within Bell Atlantic's geographic region, each of the telephone
subsidiaries, including the Company, must demonstrate to the FCC that it has
satisfied certain requirements in order to be permitted to offer interLATA
services within its jurisdiction.  Among the requirements with which the Company
must comply is a 14-point "competitive checklist" which is aimed at ensuring
that competitors have the ability to connect to the Company's network.  The
Company must also demonstrate to the FCC that its entry into the interLATA
market would be in the public interest.

   The Act also imposes specific requirements on the Company that are intended
to promote competition in the local exchange markets.  These requirements
include the duty to: (i) provide interconnection to any other carrier for the
transmission and routing of telephone exchange service and exchange access at
any technically feasible point; (ii) provide unbundled access to network
elements at any technically feasible point; (iii) provide retail services for
resale at wholesale 

                                       14

prices; (iv) establish reciprocal compensation arrangements for the origination
and termination of telecommunications and (v) provide physical collocation.

   No definitive prediction can be made as to the specific impact of the Act on
the business or financial condition of the Company.  The financial impact on the
Company will be dependent on several factors, including the timing, extent and
success of competition in the Company's market and the timing, extent and
success of the Company's pursuit of new business opportunities resulting from
the Act.

   COMPETITION

   IntraLATA Toll Services

   Competition to offer intrastate intraLATA toll services is currently
permitted in the Company's jurisdiction. Increased competition from IXCs has
resulted in a decline in several components of the Company's toll services
revenues.

   Currently, intraLATA toll calls are completed by the Company unless the
customer dials a five-digit access code. Presubscription for intraLATA toll
services would enable customers to make intraLATA toll calls using the carrier
of their choice without having to dial the five-digit access code.

   In general, the Act prohibits a state from requiring presubscription or
"dialing parity" until the earlier of such time as an  operating telephone
company in the state is authorized to provide long distance services within the
state or three years from the effective date of the Act.  This prohibition does
not apply to a final order requiring an operating telephone company to implement
presubscription that was issued on or prior to December 19, 1995.

   During 1995, the Board of Public Utilities (BPU) conducted proceedings to
determine whether, and under what conditions, to authorize presubscription.  On
December 14, 1995, the BPU issued an order finding that implementation of
presubscription for intraLATA toll services in New Jersey would be in the public
interest and proposed rules for implementation.  The BPU is expected to issue
final rules in the second quarter of 1996.  Implementation of presubscription
for intraLATA toll services could have a material negative impact on toll
service revenues, especially if the Company is not permitted contemporaneously
to offer interLATA services.

   Local Exchange Services

   The ability to offer local exchange services has historically been subject to
regulation by the BPU.  Applications from competitors to provide local exchange
services are currently pending.  The Act is expected to significantly increase
the level of competition in the Company's local exchange market. However,
increased competition in the local exchange market will facilitate FCC approval
of the Company's entry into the interLATA markets.

   See Item 1 - Description of Business, Competition on pages 4 and 5 for
additional information on the Company's competitive environment.

   OTHER STATE REGULATORY MATTERS

   The communications services of the Company are subject to regulation by the
BPU with respect to intrastate rates and certain other matters.

   See Item 1 - Description of Business, State Regulation on page 4 for a
description of the Company's current regulatory plan.

OTHER MATTERS
- -------------

   ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

   The Company is subject to a number of environmental proceedings as a result
of its operations and the shared liability provisions in the Plan of
Reorganization related to the Modification of Final Judgment.  Certain of these
environmental matters relate to a Superfund site for which the Company has been
joined as a third-party defendant in pending Superfund litigation. Such joinder
subjects the Company to potential liability for costs relating to cleanup of the
affected site.  The Company is also responsible for the remediation of sites
with underground fuel storage tanks and other expenses associated with
environmental compliance.

   The Company continually monitors its operations with respect to potential
environmental issues, including changes in legally mandated standards and
remediation technologies.  The Company's recorded liabilities reflect those
specific situations where remediation activities are currently deemed to be
probable and where the cost of remediation is estimable.  Management believes
that the aggregate amount of any additional potential liability would not have a
material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition.


FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

   Management believes that the Company has adequate internal and external
resources available to meet ongoing operating requirements, including network
expansion and modernization, and payment of dividends.  Management expects that
presently foreseeable capital requirements will be financed primarily through
internally generated funds.  Additional long-term debt may be needed to fund
development activities and to maintain the Company's capital structure within
management's guidelines.

   As of December 31, 1995, the Company had $244.9 million of an unused line of
credit with an affiliate, Bell Atlantic Network Funding Corporation.  In
addition, the Company had $50.0 million remaining under a shelf registration
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of
unsecured debt securities.

   The Company's debt ratio was 49.5% at December 31, 1995, compared to 48.2% at
December 31, 1994.

   On February 1, 1996, the Company declared and paid a dividend in the amount
of $149.0 million to Bell Atlantic.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS



To the Board of Directors and Shareowner of
Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.



We have audited the financial statements and financial statement schedule of
Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. as listed in the index on page F-1 of this Form
10-K.  The financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Bell Atlantic - New Jersey,
Inc. as of December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1995 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  In addition, in our
opinion, the financial statement schedule referred to above, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in
all material respects, the information required to be included therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements, the Company
discontinued accounting for its operations in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation," effective August 1, 1994.  Also, as discussed in Notes 1,
7 and 8 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of
accounting for income taxes and postemployment benefits in 1993.

                         NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

   Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. (the Company) is a wholly owned subsidiary
of Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic).  The Company provides two basic
types of telecommunications services in a territory consisting of three Local
Access and Transport Areas (LATAs) in the state of New Jersey.  First, the
Company transports telecommunications traffic between subscribers located within
the same LATA (intraLATA service), including both local and toll services.
Local service includes the provision of local exchange, local private line and
public telephone services.  Toll service includes message toll services and
intraLATA Wide Area Toll Service/800 services.  The Company also earns toll
revenue from the provision of telecommunications service between LATAs
(interLATA service) in the corridors between southern New Jersey and
Philadelphia and northern New Jersey and New York City.  Second, the Company
provides exchange access service, which links a subscriber's telephone equipment
to the facilities of an interexchange carrier (IXC) which, in turn, provides
interLATA telecommunications service to their customers.  The Company also
provides exchange access service to IXCs which provide intrastate intraLATA long
distance telecommunications service.  Other services provided by the Company
include directory publishing, customer premises wiring and maintenance, and
billing and collection services.

   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 is the most comprehensive revision of the
federal communications laws in over 60 years.  In general, the
Telecommunications Act includes provisions that would open the Company's local
exchange markets to competition and would permit local exchange carriers, such
as the Company, upon meeting certain conditions, to provide interLATA services
(long distance) and video programming and to engage in manufacturing.

   BASIS OF PRESENTATION

   Effective August 1, 1994, the Company discontinued accounting for its
operations under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation" (Statement
No. 71) (see Note 2).

   USE OF ESTIMATES

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities and
disclosure of contingencies.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   REVENUE RECOGNITION

   Revenues are recognized as earned on the accrual basis, which is generally
when services are rendered based on the usage of the Company's local exchange
network and facilities.

   CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

   The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90
days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.  Cash equivalents are stated
at cost, which approximates market value.

   SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

   Short-term investments consist of investments that mature 91 days to 12
months from the date of purchase.  Short-term investments are stated at cost,
which approximates market value.

   MATERIAL AND SUPPLIES

   New and reusable materials are carried in inventory, principally at average
original cost, except that specific costs are used in the case of large
individual items.

                                      F-7

                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   PREPAID DIRECTORY

   Costs of directory production and advertising sales are principally deferred
until the directory is published.  Such costs are amortized to expense and the
related advertising revenues are recognized over the average life of the
directory, which is generally 12 months.

   PLANT AND DEPRECIATION

   The Company's provision for depreciation is based principally on the
composite group remaining life method of depreciation and straight-line
composite rates.  This method provides for the recovery of the remaining net
investment in telephone plant, less anticipated net salvage value, over the
remaining asset lives.  The composite group method requires periodic revisions
to depreciation rates based on a number of variables, including retirement
estimates, survivor curves, salvage, and cost of removal.

   In connection with the discontinued application of Statement No. 71,
effective August 1, 1994, for financial reporting purposes, the Company began
using estimated asset lives for certain categories of plant and equipment that
were shorter than the regulatory lives used prior to the discontinuance of
Statement No. 71.  The shorter lives result principally from the Company's
expectation as to the revenue-producing lives of the assets.

   The following asset lives were used in 1994 and 1995:

   Other equipment............            6 - 35          6 - 35      6 - 35
</TABLE>

   When depreciable plant is replaced or retired, the amounts at which such
plant has been carried in plant, property and equipment are removed from the
respective accounts and charged to accumulated depreciation, and any gains or
losses on disposition are amortized over the remaining asset lives of the
remaining net investment in telephone plant.

   MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS

   The cost of maintenance and repairs, including the cost of replacing minor
items not constituting substantial betterments, is charged to operating expense.

   CAPITALIZED INTEREST COST

   Upon the discontinued application of Statement No. 71, effective August 1,
1994, the Company began reporting capitalized interest as a cost of telephone
plant and equipment and a reduction in interest expense, in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34,
"Capitalization of Interest Cost."

   Prior to the discontinued application of Statement No. 71, the Company
recorded an allowance for funds used during construction, which included both
interest and equity return components, as a cost of plant and as an item of
other income.

   EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

   Pensions, Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and Postemployment
Benefits

   Substantially all employees of the Company are covered under multi-employer
noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and postretirement health and life
insurance benefit plans sponsored by Bell Atlantic and certain of its
subsidiaries, including the Company.

                                      F-8
<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   Amounts contributed to the Company's pension plans are actuarially
determined, principally under the aggregate cost actuarial method, and are
subject to applicable federal income tax regulations.  Amounts contributed to
501(c)(9) trusts and 401(h) accounts under applicable federal income tax
regulations to pay certain postretirement benefits are actuarially determined,
principally under the aggregate cost actuarial method.

   The Company also provides employees with postemployment benefits such as
disability benefits, workers' compensation, and severance pay.  Effective
January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits."

   INCOME TAXES

   Bell Atlantic and its domestic subsidiaries, including the Company, file a
consolidated federal income tax return.

   Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (Statement No. 109).

   The consolidated amount of current and deferred tax expense is allocated by
applying the provisions of Statement No. 109 to each subsidiary as if it were a
separate taxpayer.

   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 repealed the investment tax credit (ITC) as of
January 1, 1986, subject to certain transitional rules.  ITCs were deferred and
are being amortized as a reduction to income tax expense over the estimated
service lives of the related assets.

   RECLASSIFICATIONS

   Certain reclassifications of prior years' data have been made to conform to
1995 classifications.


2. DISCONTINUATION OF REGULATORY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

   In the third quarter of 1994, the Company determined that it was no longer
eligible for continued application of the accounting required by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain
Types of Regulation" (Statement No. 71).  In connection with the decision to
discontinue regulatory accounting principles under Statement No. 71, the Company
recorded a noncash, extraordinary charge of $589.7 million, which is net of an
income tax benefit of $423.2 million.

   The Company's determination that it was no longer eligible for continued
application of the accounting required by Statement No. 71 was based on the
belief that the convergence of competition, technological change, actual and
potential regulatory, legislative and judicial actions, and other factors were
creating fully open and competitive markets.  In such markets, the Company does
not believe it can be assured that prices can be maintained at levels that will
recover the net carrying amount of existing telephone plant and equipment, which
has been depreciated over relatively long regulatory lives.

   A summary of the components of the after-tax charge recognized as a result of
the discontinued application of Statement No. 71 follows:

<TABLE>

   Total...............................................          $589.7       
                                                                 ======

<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   The increase in the accumulated depreciation reserve was supported by both an
impairment analysis, which identified estimated amounts not recoverable from
future discounted cash flows, and a depreciation study, which identified
inadequate depreciation reserve levels which the Company believes resulted
principally from the cumulative underdepreciation of plant as a result of the
regulatory process.  Investment tax credit amortization was accelerated as a
result of the reduction in remaining asset lives of the associated telephone
plant and equipment.

   Tax-related regulatory assets of $117.5 million and tax-related regulatory
liabilities of $145.1 million, which were established upon the adoption of
Statement No. 109 and amortized as the related deferred taxes were recognized in
the ratemaking process, were eliminated (see Note 8).  The elimination of other
regulatory assets and liabilities relates principally to deferred debt
refinancing and vacation pay costs, which were being amortized as they were
recognized in the ratemaking process.


3. PLANT, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

   Plant, property and equipment, which is stated at cost, is summarized as

4. LEASES

   The Company leases certain facilities and equipment for use in its operations
under both capital and operating leases. Plant, property and equipment included
capital leases of $68.1 million and $68.9 million, and related accumulated
amortization of $42.6 million and $39.1 million at December 31, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  The Company did not incur any initial capital lease obligations
in 1995 and 1993.  In 1994, the Company incurred initial capital lease
obligations of $.5 million.

   Total rent expense amounted to $52.6 million in 1995, $53.3 million in 1994,
and $53.6 million in 1993.   Of these amounts, $13.8 million, $12.3 million and
$6.8 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, were lease payments to
affiliated companies.

   Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 1995 includes $365.0 million that
is callable by the Company.  The call prices range from 102.5% to 100.0% of face
value, depending upon the remaining term to maturity of the issue.  In addition,
$150.0 million of long-term debt, bearing interest at 7.85%, will become
redeemable only on November 15, 1999 at the option of the holders.  The
redemption price will be 100.0% of face value, plus accrued interest.

   The Company recorded extraordinary charges associated with the early
extinguishment of debentures called by the Company of $6.7 million, net of an
income tax benefit of $3.6 million in 1994, and $6.9 million, net of an income
tax benefit of $3.6 million in 1993.

   At December 31, 1995, the Company had $50.0 million remaining under a shelf
registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

   CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

   Financial instruments that subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist primarily of trade receivables.

   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables other than
those from AT&T are limited due to the large number of customers in the
Company's customer base.  For the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993,
revenues generated from services provided to AT&T, primarily network access and
billing and collection, were $421.4 million, $419.2 million and $423.8 million,
respectively.  At December 31, 1995 and 1994, Accounts receivable, net, included
$43.7 million and $53.5 million, respectively, from AT&T.

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

   PENSION PLANS

   Substantially all of the Company's management and associate employees are
covered under multi-employer noncontributory defined benefit pension plans
sponsored by Bell Atlantic and certain of its subsidiaries, including the
Company.  The pension benefit formula is based on a flat dollar amount per year
of service according to job classification under the associate plan.  The
pension benefit formula for plans covering management employees in 1995 and
prior years is based on a stated percentage of adjusted career average earnings.
The Company's objective in funding the plans is to accumulate funds at a
relatively stable level over participants' working lives so that benefits are
fully funded at retirement.  Plan assets consist principally of investments in
domestic and foreign corporate equity securities, U.S. and foreign government
and corporate debt securities, and real estate.

   Effective January 1, 1996, the plan covering management employees was
converted to a cash balance plan.  Under the cash balance plan, pension benefits
are determined by a combination of compensation credits based on age and service
and individual account-based interest credits.  Each management employee's
opening account balance is based on accrued pension benefits as of December 31,
1995, and converted to a lump-sum amount determined under the prior plan's
provisions.  The lump-sum value is multiplied by a transition factor, based on
age and service, to arrive at the opening balance.

   Pension cost was $7.2 million, $25.7 million and $25.4 million for the years
ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  The reduction in 1995
pension cost is principally due to an increase in the discount rate from 7.25%
at December 31, 1993 to 8.25% at December 31, 1994, and plan changes.

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, "Employers' Accounting
for Pensions" (Statement No. 87) requires a comparison of the actuarial present
value of projected benefit obligations with the fair value of plan assets, the
disclosure of the components of net periodic pension costs and a reconciliation
of the funded status of the plans with amounts recorded on the balance sheets.
The Company participates in multi-employer plans and therefore, such disclosures
are not presented for the Company because the structure of the plans does not
allow for the determination of this information on an individual participating
company basis.

                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   The significant assumptions used for the pension measurements were as follows
at December 31:

   Rate of future increases in compensation levels..  4.75%  5.25%  5.25%
</TABLE>

   The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.25% for 1995, 1994
and 1993.

   Pension benefits for associate employees are subject to collective
bargaining.  Modifications in pension benefits have been bargained from time to
time.  Additionally, the Company has amended the benefit formula under pension
plans maintained for its management employees.  Substantive commitments for
future amendments to the Company's pension plans have been reflected in
determining the Company's pension cost.  The actuarial assumptions used to
determine pension cost are based on financial market interest rates, past
experience, and management's best estimate of future benefit changes and
economic conditions.  Changes in these assumptions may impact future pension
cost levels and benefit obligations.

   POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

   Substantially all of the Company's management and associate employees are
covered under postretirement health and life insurance benefit plans sponsored
by Bell Atlantic and certain of its subsidiaries, including the Company.  The
determination of benefit cost for postretirement health benefit plans is based
on comprehensive medical and dental benefit plan provisions.  The postretirement
life insurance benefit formula used in the determination of postretirement
benefit cost is primarily based on annual basic pay at retirement.  The Company
funds the postretirement health and life insurance benefits of current and
future retirees.  Plan assets consist principally of investments in domestic and
foreign corporate equity securities, and U.S. Government and corporate debt
securities.

   Postretirement benefit cost was $52.4 million, $61.5 million and $64.1
million for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
Postretirement benefit cost decreased in 1995 principally as a result of an
increase in the discount rate from 7.25% at December 31, 1993 to 8.25% at
December 31, 1994, and the effect of favorable plan experience.

   Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," (Statement No. 106) requires a
comparison of the actuarial present value of projected postretirement benefit
obligations with the fair value of plan assets, the disclosure of the components
of net periodic postretirement benefit costs, a reconciliation of the funded
status of the plan with amounts recorded on the balance sheets and the effect of
a one-percentage-point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates for
each future year on net periodic postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation.  The Company participates in multi-employer
plans and therefore, such disclosures are not presented for the Company because
the structure of the plans does not provide for the determination of this
information on an individual participating company basis.

   Assumptions used in the actuarial computations for postretirement benefits
are as follows at December 31:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

   The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.25% for 1995, 1994
and 1993.

   Postretirement benefits other than pensions for associate employees are
subject to collective bargaining agreements and have been modified from time to
time.  The Company has also periodically modified benefits under plans
maintained for its management employees. Substantive commitments for future
amendments to the Company's postretirement benefit

plans have been reflected in determining the Company's postretirement benefit
cost. The actuarial assumptions used to determine postretirement benefit cost
are based on financial market interest rates, past experience, and management's
best estimate of future benefit changes and economic conditions. Changes in
these assumptions may impact future postretirement benefit cost levels and
benefit obligations.

   POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS      

   Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits" (Statement No. 112).  The cumulative effect at January 1, 1993 of
adopting Statement No. 112 reduced net income by $30.0 million, net of a
deferred income tax benefit of $15.4 million.

   In the third quarter of 1994, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $44.9
million to recognize the Company's proportionate share of benefit costs for the
separation of employees who are entitled to benefits under preexisting Bell
Atlantic separation pay plans.  The charge, which was actuarially determined,
represents benefits earned through July 1, 1994 for employees who are expected
to receive separation payments in the future.

   SAVINGS PLANS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS      

   Substantially all of the Company's employees are eligible to participate in
savings plans established by Bell Atlantic to provide opportunities for eligible
employees to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis and encourage employees
to acquire and maintain an equity interest in Bell Atlantic.  Under these plans,
a certain percentage of eligible employee contributions are matched with shares
of Bell Atlantic common stock.  Bell Atlantic funds the matching contribution
through two leveraged employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs).  Bell Atlantic
accounts for its ESOPs in accordance with the accounting rules applicable to
companies with ESOP trusts that held securities prior to December 15, 1989.  The
Company recognizes its proportionate share of total ESOP cost based on the
Company's matching obligation attributable to participating Company employees.
The Company recorded total ESOP cost of $16.9 million, $14.4 million and $12.8
million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.


8. INCOME TAXES

   Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (Statement No. 109).

   As of January 1, 1993, the Company recorded a charge to income of $.8
million, representing the cumulative effect of adopting Statement No. 109, which
has been reflected in the Provision for Income Taxes in the Statement of
Operations and Reinvested Earnings.

   Upon adoption of Statement No. 109, the effects of required adjustments to
deferred tax balances of the Company, which would be recognized in the future
for regulatory purposes, were deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets
and liabilities in accordance with Statement No. 71.  At January 1, 1993, the
Company recorded income tax-related regulatory assets totaling $130.6 million in
Other Assets and income tax-related regulatory liabilities totaling $228.6
million in Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities - Other.  During 1993, these
regulatory assets were increased by $5.9 million and regulatory liabilities were
reduced by $21.7 million for the effect of the federal income tax rate increase
from 34% to 35%, effective January 1, 1993.

   The income tax-related regulatory assets and liabilities were eliminated as a
result of the discontinued application of Statement No. 71, effective August 1,
1994 (see Note 2).

   As a result of the increase in the federal corporate income tax rate from 34%
to 35%, effective January 1, 1993, the Company recorded a net charge to the tax
provision of $.1 million in 1993.

   The provision for income taxes varies from the amount computed by applying
the statutory federal income tax rate to income before provision for income
taxes.  The difference is attributable to the following factors:

                             STOCKHOLDERS' MEETINGS

          Place of Meeting.  Meetings of the stockholders shall be held at the
principal office of the Corporation in the State of New Jersey, or at such other
place in the municipality in which the principal officer may be located as may
be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors.

          Annual Meeting; Election of Directors and Inspectors of Election.
There shall be an annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation for the
election of Directors and Inspectors of Election, and for the transaction of
such other business as may be brought before the meeting.  Any business which
may properly be brought before a general meeting of the stockholders and, if due
notice is given, any business which may be considered and transacted at a
special meeting of the stockholders, may be considered at the annual meeting.

     The annual meeting shall be held on the third Tuesday in March of each year
(unless that day be a holiday, then on the next business day) between the hours
of 10 o'clock in the forenoon and 3 o'clock in the afternoon or as soon
thereafter as may be convenient.
 
          Inspectors of Election.  There shall be two Inspectors of Election
elected at the annual meeting of the stockholders to serve for one year and
until their successors are elected.  They shall act as inspectors at elections
held during the ensuing year and at the next succeeding annual election for
Directors and Inspectors of Election.  Either of the Inspectors, in the absence
of the other shall have power to conduct an election.  If none of the Inspectors
is present at an election, the stockholders present at the opening of the
meeting shall fill the vacancies by the vote of the holders of record of a
majority in interest of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote and
who are present in person or by proxy.  No person who is a candidate for 
<PAGE>
 
the office of Director shall act as judge, inspector or clerk of any election
for Directors.

          Elections.  The polls at every election for Directors and Inspectors
of Election shall remain open until all of the stockholders present in person or
by proxy have voted or have had an opportunity to vote.

     At every election each stockholder, whether resident or non-resident, shall
be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of stock held by
such stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its
date.

          Special Meetings.  A special meeting of the stockholders may be called
by the Directors or the President at any time, and the President shall call a
special meeting whenever he is requested, in writing, to do so by two of the
Directors, or by the holders of record of not less than one-third in interest of
the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation.

          Notice of Meetings.  Unless otherwise required by law, a written or
printed notice of the time and place of every annual meeting, and of the time,
place and purpose of every special meeting of the stockholders shall be given,
or caused to be given, by the Secretary to each stockholder of record at least
two days before the date specified for such meeting.

          Quorum.  At any meeting of the stockholders, the holders of a majority
in interest of all the issued and outstanding stock of the Corporation, who are
present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum.

     If less than a quorum be present, a majority of those present shall
nevertheless have power to adjourn such meeting to another date.

          Number and Qualifications of Directors.  The Board of Directors shall

<PAGE>
 
ten (10) Directors. Each director shall continue in office for one year, and
until his successor shall be elected and qualified.

          Meetings; Time and Place.  A stated meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be held as soon as practicable, but not later than thirty days after the
annual meeting of the stockholders.  Thereafter stated meetings shall be held at
such times and places as may be fixed from time to time by the Board; provided,
however, that if it be determined by the President that it would be desirable to
hold any such meeting at a time or place other than that fixed by the Board, the
President may designate another time or place for holding that meeting.

     Any or all directors may participate in a meeting of the Board or a
committee of the Board by means of conference telephone or any means of
communication by which all persons participating in the meeting are able to hear
each other.  A Board or committee meeting may be held entirely or partially by
such means and any director so participating shall be counted as present at the
meeting for all purposes.

     A special meeting of the Board of Directors may be called by the President
whenever he shall deem it advisable, and he shall call such a meeting whenever
requested, in writing, to do so by two members of the Board.

     If at any meeting of the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, if
there be one, and the President are absent, then the Board shall select from
among the Directors present one of their number to preside at that meeting.

          Notice of Meetings.  Unless otherwise required by law, a written or
printed notice of the time and place of every stated meeting of the Board of
Directors, and of the time, place and purpose of every special meeting of the
Board shall be given, or caused to be given, by the Secretary to each Director
at least two days before the date specified for such meeting.

          Quorum.  At any meeting of the Board of Directors a majority of the
Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum, except that in the event of
a major catastrophe of the kind referred to in Section 2.6 of these By-Laws a
quorum shall 

                                       3
<PAGE>
 
consist of a majority of the Directors then available until such time as it
shall be determined that all of the Directors are available for service on the
Board.

     If less than a quorum be present, a majority of those present shall
nevertheless have power to adjourn such meeting to another date.

          Powers.  The Board of Directors shall manage the business, affairs,
and property of the Corporation.  Any directorship not filled at the annual
meeting and any vacancy, however caused, occurring in the Board of Directors may
be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors.
They may appoint an Executive Committee and may appoint such other committees as
