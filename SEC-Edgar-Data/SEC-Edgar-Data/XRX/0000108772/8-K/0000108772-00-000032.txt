Item 5.  Other Events

On October 31, 2000, a shareholder derivative action was commenced in the
United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf of
Registrant against all current members of the Board of Directors, former CEO
and Board member G. Richard Thoman (collectively, the "Individual
Defendants"), and Registrant, as a nominal defendant.  Plaintiff claims breach
of fiduciary duties and gross mismanagement related to certain of the
accounting practices at Registrant's operations in Mexico. The complaint
alleges that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties and
mismanaged Registrant's business and assets by, among other things, permitting
improper accounting practices to occur at Registrant's Mexican operations,
failing to oversee or have in place sufficient controls and procedures to
monitor accounting practices, and disseminating or permitting to be
disseminated, misleading information to shareholders, the investing public and
the public at large.  Plaintiff claims that Registrant has suffered
unspecified damages and seeks judgment, among other things, removing and
replacing the Individual Defendants as directors of Registrant, requiring the
Individual Defendants to pay to Registrant unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages, and awarding Plaintiff the costs of the action, including
attorneys' and other expert fees.

The Individual Defendants deny the wrongdoing alleged in the complaint and
intend to vigorously defend the action.
