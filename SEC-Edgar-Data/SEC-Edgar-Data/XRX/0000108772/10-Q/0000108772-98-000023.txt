    taken in the first quarter of 1998.  The loss from Insurance operations as 
    set forth above and the sale-related impacts (excluding the $190 million 
    after-tax write-off), were charged to reserves established for this purpose 
    and, therefore, did not impact our earnings.

 On August 13, 1998, we closed on the previously announced sale of 
Crum & Forster Holdings, Inc. (CFI) to Fairfax Financial Holdings 
Limited of Toronto for $680 million, including the repayment of 
$115 million in debt.  We incurred approximately $75 million in 
transaction-related costs.
 
 With the completion of the CFI transaction, we have effectively 
completed our exit from insurance and financial services.  A 
write-off of $190 million after-tax was recorded in the first 
quarter of 1998.
