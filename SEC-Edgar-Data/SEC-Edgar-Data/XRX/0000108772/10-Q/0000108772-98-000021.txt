Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time Xerox Corporation (the Registrant or the Company) and its 
representatives may provide information, whether orally or in writing, 
including certain statements in this Form 10-Q under "Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," which are 
deemed to be "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("Litigation Reform Act").  These forward-
looking statements and other information relating to the Company are based on 
the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information 
currently available to management.

The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," and 
similar expressions, as they relate to the Company or the Company's 
management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Such 
statements reflect the current views of the Registrant with respect to future 
events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should 
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially 
from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.  
The Registrant does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.

In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act we are making 
investors aware that such "forward-looking" statements, because they relate to 
future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors 
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in 
the "forward-looking" statements.  Such factors include but are not limited to 
the following:

Competition - the Registrant operates in an environment of significant 
competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of 
customers to become more efficient.  There are a number of companies worldwide 
with significant financial resources which compete with the Registrant to 
provide document processing products and services in each of the markets 
served by the Registrant, some of whom operate on a global basis.  The 
Registrant's success in its future performance is largely dependent upon its 
ability to compete successfully in its currently-served  markets and to expand 
into additional market segments.  

Transition to Digital - presently black and white light-lens copiers represent 
more than 40% of the Registrant's revenues.  This segment of the general 
office is mature with anticipated declining industry revenues as the market 
transitions to digital technology.  Some of the Registrant's new digital 
products replace or compete with the Registrant's current light-lens 
equipment.  Changes in the mix of products from light-lens to digital, and the 
pace of that change as well as competitive developments could cause actual 
results to vary from those expected.

Pricing - the Registrant's ability to succeed is dependent upon its ability to 
obtain adequate pricing for its products and services which provide a 
reasonable return to shareholders.  Depending on competitive market factors, 
future prices the Registrant can obtain for its products and services may vary 
from historical levels.

Financing Business - a significant portion of the Registrant's profits arise 
from the financing of its customers' purchase of the Registrant's equipment.  
On average, 75 to 80 percent of equipment sales are financed through the 
Registrant.  The Registrant's ability to provide such financing at competitive 
                                      2
<PAGE>
rates and realize profitable spreads is highly dependent upon its own costs of 
borrowing which, in turn, depend upon its credit ratings.  Significant changes 
in such ratings could reduce the profitability of such financing business 
and/or make the Registrant's financing less attractive to customers thus 
reducing the volume of financing business done.  The Registrant's present 
credit ratings permit ready access to the credit markets.  There is no 
assurance that these credit ratings can be maintained and/or ready access to 
the credit markets can be assured.

Productivity - the Registrant's ability to sustain and improve its profit 
margins is largely dependent on its ability to maintain an efficient, cost-
effective operation.  Productivity improvements through process reengineering, 
design efficiency and supplier cost improvements are required to offset labor 
and materials cost inflation and competitive price pressures.

International Operations - the Registrant derives approximately half its 
revenue from operations outside of the United States.  In addition, the 
Registrant manufactures many of its products and/or their components outside 
the United States.  The Registrant's future revenue, cost and profit results 
could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates, changes in economic conditions from country 
to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection 
measures, licensing requirements and local tax issues.

New Products/Research and Development - the process of developing new high 
technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain.  It 
requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging 
technological trends.  The Registrant must then make long-term investments and 
commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will 
eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and revenues 
required to provide anticipated returns from these investments.

Disengagement from Insurance Business - during the process of disengaging from 
the insurance business, the Registrant will continue to be subject to all the 
business risks and rewards of the remaining unit, Crum & Forster Holdings, 
Inc. (CFI).  Until CFI is actually sold, no assurances can be given as to the 
ultimate impact on the Registrant's total results from operations or whether 
the proceeds from CFI's sale will equal its carrying value.  The insurance 
business is subject to cyclical competitive conditions, judicial decisions 
affecting insurers' liabilities, and by volatile and unpredictable 
developments, including changes in the propensity of courts to grant large 
awards, fluctuations in interest rates, inflationary pressures that may tend 
to affect the size of losses and changes in the investment environment that 
affect market prices of insurance companies' investments.  CFI's operating 
results have historically been influenced by these industry trends, as well as 
by its exposure to uncollectible reinsurance, which had been greater than for 
most other insurers.

Restructuring - the Registrant's ability to ultimately reduce pre-tax annual 
expenditures by approximately $1 billion is dependent upon its ability to 
successfully implement the 1998 restructuring program including the 
elimination of 9,000 jobs worldwide, the closing and consolidation of 
facilities, and the successful implementation of process and systems changes.

           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.  The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements 
presented herein have been prepared by Xerox Corporation ("the 
Company") in accordance with the accounting policies described in 
its 1997 Annual Report to Shareholders and should be read in 
conjunction with the notes thereto.

Effective 1998, Fuji Xerox changed its reporting period from a 
fiscal year ending December 20 to a fiscal year ending December 
31.  The results of operations during the period between the end 
of the 1997 fiscal year and the beginning of the new fiscal year 
(the stub period) amounted to a loss of $6 million.  The loss was 
debited to retained earnings.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of 
normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair 
statement of operating results for the interim periods presented 
have been made.

References herein to "we" or "our" refer to Xerox and 
consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically 
requires otherwise.


2.  Inventories consist of (in millions):

                                         June 30,      December 31,

3.  On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring 
program associated with enhancing our competitive position and 
lowering our overall cost structure. In connection with this 
program, we recorded a second-quarter, pretax provision of $1,644 
million ($1,107 million after taxes including our share, $18 
million, of a restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox).  The 
program will include the elimination of approximately 9,000 jobs 
worldwide, the closing and consolidation of facilities, and the 
write-down of certain assets to net realizable value.  The 
charges associated with this action include $113 million of 
inventory charges recorded as cost of revenues, $316 million of 
asset impairments and $1,215 million for employee termination and 
other exit costs.  Key initiatives will include:
1) Consolidating 56 European customer support centers into one
   facility and implementing a shared services organization which
                                      8
<PAGE>
                      Xerox Corporation
           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

   will generate order entry, invoicing, and other back-office
   and sales operations.
2) Streamlining manufacturing, logistics, distribution and
   service operations.  This will include centralizing U.S. parts
   depots  and outsourcing storage and distribution.
3) Overhauling our internal processes and associated resources,
   including closing one of four geographically-organized U.S.
   customer administrative centers.
 
 The reductions will occur primarily in administrative functions, 
but will also impact service, research and manufacturing.
 
 The following table summarizes the anticipated costs associated 
with the restructuring program (in millions):
 
                                            Total
                                           Reserve
 Severance and related costs               $1,017
 Asset impairment                             316
 Lease cancellation and other costs           198
 Inventory charges                            113
 Total                                     $1,644
 
 As of June 30, 1998, approximately 1,500 employees have left the 
Company and termination benefits of $120 million have been 
charged to the reserve.  Asset impairment, inventory charges and 
other charges of $316 million, $113 million and $13 million, 
respectively, have also been charged against the restructuring 
reserve.  The restructuring reserve balance at June 30, 1998 
amounted to $1,082 million which relates to cash expenditures to 
be incurred primarily in the remainder of 1998 and in 1999.
 
 
 4.  In May 1998, we acquired XLConnect Solutions, Inc. 
("XLConnect"), an information technology services company, and 
its parent Company, Intelligent Electronics, Inc. ("Intelligent 
Electronics") for $413 million in cash.  The operating results of 
these companies, which are immaterial, have been included in our 
consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition.  
Based on the allocation of the purchase price, this transaction 
resulted in goodwill of $395 million (including transaction 
costs), which is being amortized over 25 years.

 Effective January 1, 1998, we adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income."  
This Statement requires that companies disclose comprehensive 
income, which includes net income, foreign currency translation 
adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments, and 
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified 
as available-for-sale.
 
 Comprehensive income is as follows (in millions):

 6. In April 1998, we issued convertible subordinated debentures 
for net proceeds of $575 million.  The proceeds were used to 
reduce commercial paper.  The amount due upon maturity in April 
2018 is $1,012 million, resulting in an effective interest rate 
of 3.625% per annum, including 1.003% payable in cash 
semiannually, beginning in October 1998.  These debentures are 
convertible at any time at the option of the holder into 3.904 
shares of our stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of 
debentures.
 
 7.  Interest expense totaled $334 million and $288 million for 
the six months ended June 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

    of the Insurance subsidiaries and the $190 million after-tax write-off 
    taken in the first quarter of 1998.  The loss from Insurance operations as 
    set forth above and the sale-related impacts (excluding the $190 million 
    after-tax write-off), were charged to reserves established for this purpose 
    and, therefore, did not impact our earnings.

 On March 11, 1998, we announced an agreement to sell Crum & 
Forster Holdings, Inc. (CFI) to Fairfax Financial Holdings 
Limited (Fairfax) of Toronto.  Upon closing, the transaction will 
effectively complete the sale of the Talegen Holdings, Inc. 
insurance properties.

           Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Under terms of the agreement, Fairfax will acquire the stock of 
CFI for total consideration of $680 million, including the 
repayment of $115 million of debt.  We will incur approximately 
$75 million in transaction-related costs.  The transaction, 
expected to close in the third quarter, is subject to customary 
closing conditions and regulatory approval.
 
 Upon completion of this transaction, we will have effectively 
completed our exit from insurance and financial services.  A 
write-off of $190 million, after tax, was taken as of March 31, 
1998.
 
 
9.  Litigation 
     
Continuing Operations

On March 10, 1994, a lawsuit was filed in the United States 
District Court for the District of Kansas by two independent 
service organizations (ISOs) in Kansas City and St. Louis and 
their parent company.  Subsequently, a single corporate entity, 
CSU,L.L.C.("CSU") was substituted for the three affiliated 
companies. CSU claims damages predominately resulting from the 
Company's alleged refusal to sell parts for high volume copiers 
and printers to CSU prior to 1994. The Company's policies and 
practices with respect to the sale of parts to ISOs were at issue 
in an antitrust class action in Texas, which was settled by the 
Company during 1994. Claims for individual lost profits of ISOs 
who were not named parties, such as CSU, were not included in 
that class action.  The Company has asserted counterclaims 
against CSU alleging patent and copyright infringement  relating 
to the copying of diagnostic software and service manuals.  On 
April 8, 1997, the District Court granted partial summary 
judgment in favor of the Company on CSU's  antitrust claims, 
ruling that the Company's unilateral refusal to sell or license 
its patented parts cannot give rise to antitrust liability.  The 
Court's ruling did not preclude a finding of antitrust liability 
based upon other allegations of exclusionary conduct, including 
the refusal to sell unpatented parts.  The District Court also 
granted summary judgment in favor of the Company on its patent 
infringement claim, leaving open with respect to patent 
infringement only the issues of willfulness and the amount of 
damages, and granted partial summary judgment in favor of the 
Company with respect to some of its claims of copyright 
infringement.  On July 17, 1997 and December 22, 1997 the Court 
denied CSU's motions for reconsideration. On  June 16-17, 1998 a 
trial was held to establish copyright infringement damages to be 
awarded to Xerox for the unlawful copying of the Company's 
diagnostic software. A settlement was reached with regard to the 
                                      12

Company's infringement  claims relating to service manuals.  The 
Court has not yet issued a ruling following trial on copyright 
infringement damages.

On April 11, 1996, an action was commenced by Accuscan Corp. 
(Accuscan), in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York, against the Company seeking unspecified 
damages for infringement of a patent of Accuscan which expired in 
1993.  The original suit was directed to facsimile products and 
sought damages for sales between 1990 and 1993.  In late January 
1998, Accuscan provided to the Company its expert report on the 
issue of damages seeking $225,000,000 for infringement not only 
of facsimile machines but other Company hardware.  The Company's 
expert report states that it is believed that the appropriate 
amount of damages, if liability should be established, is 
$150,000.  The Company (i) denies any liability to plaintiff, 
(ii) denies that the patent in suit is valid or infringed, and 
(iii) asserts that the damage calculations used by plaintiff are 
inconsistent with the facts in numerous respects. The Company 
intends to vigorously defend the action. On April 1, 1998, the 
jury entered a  verdict in favor of Accuscan against the Company  
for infringement of a patent which expired in 1993. The verdict 
in favor of Accuscan was for $40,000,000. The Company believes 
that the verdict should be set aside and has made appropriate 
motions to the Court regarding the verdict, is awaiting the 
Court's decision and will vigorously pursue any appeal required.

 Item 2                   Xerox Corporation
              Management's Discussion and Analysis of
            Results of Operations and Financial Condition
 
                          Document Processing
 
 Summary
 
 On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring program 
associated with enhancing our competitive position and lowering 
our overall cost structure. In connection with this program, we 
recorded a second-quarter pretax provision of $1,644 million 
($1,107 million after taxes and including our share of the Fuji 
Xerox restructuring charge).
 
 Income from continuing operations, before restructuring charges, 
increased 17 percent to $395 million in the 1998 second quarter 
from $337 million in the 1997 second quarter. Including a $1,107 
million after-tax charge in connection with the previously 
announced worldwide restructuring program, the second quarter net 
loss was $712 million.
 
 Revenues of $4.7 billion in the quarter represented 10 percent 
growth on a pre-currency basis, the third consecutive quarter of 
double-digit revenue growth. The pre-currency revenue growth was 
driven by 19 percent growth in equipment sales (excluding OEM 
sales).  After the adverse effect of currency, revenue growth was 
9 percent.
 
 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 16 
percent to $1.09 in the second quarter excluding the restructuring 
charge.
 
 For the first six months of the year, diluted earnings per share 
from continuing operations, before the restructuring charge, 
increased 14 percent to $1.93 and income from continuing 
operations increased 15 percent to $697 million. Including the 
restructuring charge, Xerox reported a first-half net loss of $600 
million, or a loss of $1.90 per share.
 
 Revenues in the first half of 1998 were $9 billion, compared with 
$8.4 billion a year ago.
 
 Pre-Currency Growth
 
 To understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is 
helpful to adjust revenue and expense growth (except for ratios) 
to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign 
currencies into U.S. dollars.  We refer to this adjusted growth as 
"pre-currency growth."
 
 A substantial portion of our consolidated revenues is derived from 
operations outside of the United States where the U.S. dollar is 
                                     14
<PAGE>
not the functional currency. When compared with the average of the 
major European currencies on a revenue-weighted basis, the U.S. 
dollar was approximately 3 percent stronger in the 1998 second 
quarter than in the 1997 second quarter; only the pound sterling 
was stronger. As a result, currency translation had an unfavorable 
impact of one percentage point on total revenues in the 1998 
second quarter and two percentage points on total revenues in the 
1998 first half.
 
 Revenues denominated in currencies where the local currency is the 
functional currency are not hedged for purposes of translation 
into U.S. dollars.
 
 Revenues
 
 For the major product categories, the pre-currency revenue growth 
rates are as follows:
 
                                      1997                  1998  _

 Light Lens Copiers         (2)  (3)   1    (2)  (2)       (4)  (8)
 
 Digital product revenue growth accelerated to 39 percent in the 
1998 second quarter, reaching 43 percent of total revenues and 
surpassing light lens revenues in absolute dollars for the first 
time. In the 1997 second quarter, digital revenues represented 34 
percent of total revenues. The expanding black and white Document 
Centre digital copier family revenues represented 22 percentage 
points of the year-over-year digital revenue growth. Color copying 
and printing grew 27 percent in the 1998 second quarter, with 
continued excellent growth in the DocuColor 40 and excellent 
installations of the DocuColor Office 6 introduced in April. 
Production publishing grew 21 percent in the 1998 second quarter 
and computer printing grew 2 percent following an unusually strong 
1997 second quarter.  For the first six months of 1998, digital 
product revenue grew 37 percent with half the growth driven by the 
Document Centre digital copier family as well as a 34 percent 
growth in color copying and printing, 19 percent increase in 
production publishing and a 4 percent increase in computer 
printing.
 
 Black-and-white light lens copier revenues declined 8 percent in 
the 1998 second quarter and 6 percent in the first six months of 
1998 due to customer transition to the company's new digital 
products and continued pricing pressures.  These revenues were 43 
percent of total revenues in the 1998 second quarter compared with 
51 percent of total revenues in the 1997 second quarter.

 Second quarter and first half U.S. revenue growth was driven by 
excellent digital equipment sales and document outsourcing.
 
 Xerox Limited and related companies manufacture and market Xerox 
products principally in Europe. Xerox Limited growth in the 1998 
second quarter and first half was driven by excellent digital 
equipment sales and document outsourcing growth and strong growth 
in supplies. Holland, Italy, and Spain had strong revenue growth 
in the second quarter, the U.K. and Germany had good growth, and 
France had modest growth.
 
 Other Areas include operations principally in Latin America, 
Canada and China. Growth in Other Areas during the 1998 second 
quarter was driven by good equipment sales and strong document 
outsourcing growth.  For the first half, growth in Other Areas was 
driven by strong equipment sales and document outsourcing growth.  
Revenue in Brazil declined by single digits in the 1998 second 
quarter and was essentially flat in the first half of 1998.  
Brazil's profits declined for the second quarter and first half of 
1998, however, we are anticipating modest economic growth in 
Brazil and on that basis, expect modest profit growth in our 
Brazilian affiliate  in the second half of 1998.  Canada, Mexico 
and a number of the smaller Latin American affiliates including 
Argentina and Chile had excellent growth in the second quarter.
 
 Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., an unconsolidated entity, jointly owned by 
Xerox Limited and Fuji Photo Film Company Limited, develops, 
manufactures and distributes document processing products in 
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other areas of the Pacific Rim.  
Fuji Xerox revenue declined modestly in the 1998 second quarter 
and the first half reflecting a modest decline in Japan and a 
double digit decline in Fuji Xerox' other Asian territories.

 *Excludes equipment in outsourcing contracts that are accounted 
for as sales.
 
 Equipment sales in the 1998 first half grew 18 percent and in the 
1998 second quarter grew 19 percent which represented the seventh 
consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.  The equipment sales 
growth was driven by excellent growth in digital product sales. 
Approximately 50 percent of 1998 second quarter equipment sales 
was due to products introduced since 1997, including the company's 
expanding line of black-and-white digital copiers, the DocuTech 
6180, the 5750 Empress color copier/printer, the DocuColor Office 
6, and network printers sold through indirect channels.
 
 Supplies sales growth accelerated in the 1998 second quarter and 
first half due to excellent growth in indirect channels and 
competitive supplies.
 
 Paper sales: Our strategy is to charge a spread over mill 
wholesale prices to cover our costs and value added as a 
distributor. Modest revenue growth in the 1998 second quarter and 
good growth in the first half of 1998 primarily reflects volume 
increases in part due to expanding distribution channels, 
partially offset by moderating prices in Europe.
 
 Combined service, rental, document outsourcing and other revenues 
grew 6 percent in the 1998 second quarter. Service revenues grew 1 
percent in the 1998 second quarter and 2 percent in the first half 
as the impact of higher machine populations resulting from higher 
equipment sales was partially offset by competitive price 
                                     17
<PAGE>
pressures and customer preference for document outsourcing. Rental 
revenues continued to decline, due primarily to customers' 
preference for purchase or document outsourcing rather than 
rental.
 
 Document Outsourcing revenues are split between Equipment Sales 
and Document Outsourcing. Where document outsourcing contracts 
include revenue accounted for as equipment sales, this revenue is 
included as Equipment Sales on the income statement.  All other 
document outsourcing revenue, including service, equipment rental, 
supplies, paper, and labor, are included in 
Service/Rentals/Outsourcing/Other on the income statement.  This 
has the effect of diverting some revenues from supplies, paper, 
service and rental.  The excellent Document Outsourcing growth 
reflects the trend of customers to focus on their core businesses 
and outsource their document processing requirements to Xerox.  
The growth rate for total document outsourcing revenue is 
substantially higher than the growth included in 
Service/Rentals/Outsourcing/Other, reflecting an increase in the 
proportion of equipment in outsourcing contracts accounted for as 
sales.
 
 Finance income: Our strategy for financing equipment sales in the 
industrialized economies is to charge a spread over our cost of 
borrowing and to lock in that spread by match funding the finance 
receivables with borrowings of similar maturities. Good growth in 
the financing of equipment sales in the U.S., Europe, and Latin 
America has been partially offset by lower average interest rates.
 
 Key Ratios and Expenses
 
 The trend in key ratios was as follows:
 
                                 1997                    1998  _
                      Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    FY       Q1    Q2
 
 Gross Margin       46.4% 47.8% 46.5% 47.0% 46.9%    45.0% 45.6%
 SAG % Revenue      29.2  29.5  29.5  27.1  28.7     27.9  27.3
 
 The gross margin declined by 2.2 percentage points in the 1998 
second quarter from the 1997 second quarter and 1.8 percentage 
points in the 1998 first half from the 1997 first half.  The 
second quarter 1998 gross margin decline was primarily due to 
weaker results in Brazil where there was a significant impact on 
placements of higher margin products. The impact of Brazil was 
approximately half the gross margin decline in the second quarter.  
In addition, margins in the second quarter and first half were 
impacted by the increasing proportion of revenue from lower margin 
indirect channels and Document Outsourcing business, continued 
competitive price pressures and adverse currency, partially offset 
by productivity.  The gross margin for the 1998 second quarter and 
1998 first half, including the inventory charges associated with 
                                     18
<PAGE>
the restructuring program, was 43.2 percent and 44.0 percent, 
respectively.
 
 Selling, administrative and general expenses (SAG) increased 2 
percent in the 1998 second quarter due to increased sales coverage 
and advertising investments while general and administrative 
expenses declined.  SAG was  27.3 percent of revenue during the 
1998 second quarter and 27.6 percent of revenue in the first half, 
a reduction of 2.2 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively, 
primarily due to continuing productivity initiatives and expense 
controls.
 
 Research and development (R&D) expense declined 6 percent in the 
1998 second quarter and 7 percent in the 1998 first half. We 
continue to invest in technological development to maintain our 
premier position in the rapidly changing document processing 
market with an added focus on increasing the effectiveness of that 
investment. We expect R&D spending will grow modestly in the 1998 
full year.  Xerox R&D is strategically coordinated with that of 
Fuji Xerox which invested $612 million in R&D in the 1997 full 
year, for a combined total of $1.7 billion.
 
 Worldwide employment increased by 1,000 in the 1998 second quarter 
to 93,400 as a result of the acquisition of XLConnect Solutions, 
Inc. (XLConnect), an information technology services company with 
1,700 employees, and the net hiring of 800 employees primarily for 
the company's fast-growing document outsourcing business, 
partially offset by 1,500 employees leaving the company under the 
worldwide restructuring program.  
 
 The  increase in other expenses, net, during the 1998 second 
quarter and first half  was due to increased non-financing 
interest expense and goodwill amortization associated with our 
June 1997 acquisition of The Rank Group's remaining interest in 
Xerox Limited and our May 1998 acquisition of XLConnect, and a 
planned increase in year 2000 remediation costs.
 
 Income Taxes (Benefits), Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated 
Affiliates and Minorities' Interests in the Earnings of 
Subsidiaries
 
 Income before income taxes and the effects of the restructuring 
program increased 10 percent to $545 million in the 1998 second 
quarter from $497 million in the 1997 second quarter.
 
 The effective tax rate before the effect of the restructuring 
program was 31.2 percent in the 1998 second quarter compared with 
35.2 percent in the 1997 second quarter due to the worldwide mix 
of profits and a tax refund.  The effective tax rate for the 1998 
first half is 32.0 percent and we now expect the 1998 full year 
tax rate to be in line with the first half.
                                     19
<PAGE>
 Equity in the net income of unconsolidated affiliates is 
principally the Xerox Limited share of Fuji Xerox income. Total 
equity in net income decreased in the 1998 second quarter and 
first half due to our share, $18 million, of a restructuring 
charge recorded by Fuji Xerox in the 1998 second quarter; lower 
Fuji Xerox income reflecting difficult economic conditions in 
Japan and their Asia Pacific operations; and adverse currency 
translation.  We expect the difficult economic conditions and 
adverse currency to continue to affect Fuji Xerox' operations and 
that their earnings will be below 1997 for the rest of the year.
 
 The Minorities' Interests reduction in the 1998 second quarter and 
first half was primarily the result of our June 1997 acquisition 
of the remaining interest in Xerox Limited.
 
 On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring program 
associated with enhancing our competitive position and lowering 
our overall cost structure. In connection with this program, we 
recorded a second-quarter pretax provision of $1,644 million 
($1,107 million after taxes and including our share of the Fuji 
Xerox restructuring charge).  The program will include the 
elimination of approximately 9,000 jobs worldwide, the closing and 
consolidation of facilities, and the write-down of certain assets.  
The pre-tax charges associated with this action include $1,215 
million for employee termination and other exit costs, $316 
million of asset impairments, and $113 million of inventory 
charges recorded as cost of revenues.  Key initiatives will 
include:
1) Consolidating 56 European customer support centers into one
   facility and implementing a shared services organization which
   will generate order entry, invoicing, and other back-office and
   sales operations.
2) Streamlining manufacturing, logistics, distribution and service
   operations.  This will include centralizing U.S. parts depots 
   and outsourcing storage and distribution.
3) Overhauling our internal processes and associated resources,
   including closing one of four geographically-organized U.S.
   customer administrative centers.

The reductions will occur primarily in administrative functions, 
but will also impact service, research and manufacturing.

The following table summarizes the anticipated costs associated 
with the restructuring program (in millions):

                                          Total
                                         Reserve
Severance and related costs               $1,017
Asset impairment                             316
Lease cancellation and other costs           198
Inventory Charges                            113
Total                                     $1,644
                                      20
<PAGE>
When fully implemented, the ongoing pre-tax savings from the 
restructuring initiatives will be approximately $1 billion 
annually. Initially, more than half of the savings will be 
reinvested to implement process and systems changes in order to 
enable the restructuring, and in ongoing efforts to broaden and 
strengthen marketing programs and distribution channels to enhance 
revenue growth.

Selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of 
revenue will move from the high 20's to the low 20's over time, 
driven primarily by large reductions in overhead costs.  
Manufacturing and service productivity will also improve.  These 
benefits will be somewhat offset by lower gross margins overall 
due to the increasing proportion of business conducted through 
indirect sales channels and outsourcing.

As of June 30, 1998, approximately 1,500 employees had left the 
company under the program, and termination benefits of $120 
million have been charged to the reserve.  Asset impairment, 
inventory charges and other charges of $316 million, $113 million 
and $13 million, respectively, have also been charged against the 
restructuring reserve.  The restructuring reserve balance at June 
30, 1998 amounted to $1,082 million which relates to cash 
expenditures to be incurred primarily during the remainder of 1998 
and in 1999.

In April 1998, we announced that we were reactivating our $1 
billion stock repurchase program, which was suspended last year 
when we acquired the remaining financial interest in Rank Xerox, 
now Xerox Limited.  During the second quarter, the company 
repurchased 470 thousand shares at a cost of $47 million.  Since 
the program inception in 1996, share repurchases total 9 million 
shares for $468 million.

In May 1998, the company completed the $413 million acquisition of 
XLConnect, an information technology services company, and its 
parent company, Intelligent Electronics, Inc.  The results of 
operations for these companies, which are immaterial, have been 
included in our results of operations since the date of 
acquisition.

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, 
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  
SFAS No. 133 requires companies to recognize all derivatives as 
assets or liabilities measured at their fair value.  Gains or 
losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives 
would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and 
whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. We do not expect this 
Statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. This Statement is effective for fiscal years beginning 
after June 15, 1999.  We will adopt this accounting standard 
beginning January 1, 2000.

                      Discontinued Operations

The net investment in the discontinued financial services 
businesses which includes Insurance, Other Financial Services and 
Third Party Financing and Real Estate totaled $1,114 million at 
June 30, 1998 compared with $1,332 million at December 31, 1997.  
The decrease primarily reflects the sale of Westchester Specialty 
Group, Inc. (WSG) and a reserve increase recorded in the first 
quarter, somewhat offset by scheduled funding of reinsurance 
coverage to the present and former Talegen Holdings, Inc. 
(Talegen) companies and The Resolution Group, Inc. (TRG) by Ridge 
Reinsurance Limited (Ridge Re) and interest for the period on the 
assigned debt.  A discussion of the discontinued businesses 
follows.

Insurance

In 1995, we recorded a $1,546 million after-tax charge in 
connection with agreements to sell all of our "Remaining" 
insurance companies, which included Coregis Group, Inc. (Coregis), 
Crum & Forster Holdings, Inc. (CFI), Industrial Indemnity 
Holdings, Inc. (II), WSG, TRG and three insurance-related service 
companies.

On September 11, 1996, those transactions were terminated.  No 
additional charges were considered necessary as a result of the 
termination.  In September 1996, the Board of Directors of Xerox 
formally approved a plan of disposal under which we retained 
investment bankers to assist us in the simultaneous disposition of 
each of the Remaining insurance and service companies.

Significant progress was made during 1997 and 1998 in the 
disposition of the remaining companies. Specifically:

- -  In the first quarter of 1997, we sold certain assets of Apprise 
Corp., one of Talegen's insurance related service companies.  The 
financial terms of this transaction were not material.

- -  In the second quarter of 1997, we completed the sale of Coregis 
for $375 million in cash and the assumption of $75 million in 
debt.

- -  In the third quarter of 1997, we completed the sale of II for 
$365 million in cash and the assumption of $79 million in debt.

- -  In the fourth quarter of 1997, we completed the sale of TRG for 
$150 million in cash and a $462 million performance-based 
instrument to an investor group.  Ultimate recovery of the value 
of this instrument will be dependent on TRG's future cash flows 
available for dividends.

- -  In the first quarter of 1998, we completed the sale of WSG for 
$338 million in cash, less approximately $70 million in 
transaction-related costs.

- -  On August 13, 1998, we closed on the previously announced sale 
of CFI to Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited of Toronto for $680 
million, including the repayment of $115 million in debt.  We 
incurred approximately $75 million in transaction-related costs.

With the completion of the CFI transaction, we have effectively 
completed our exit from insurance and financial services.  A 
write-off of $190 million after-tax was recorded in the first 
quarter of 1998.

Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI) continues to provide 
aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage to the current and 
former Talegen and TRG units through Ridge Re, a wholly owned 
subsidiary.  As of July 1998, XFSI is obligated to pay four 
remaining annual premium installments of $45 million, plus finance 
charges for coverage totaling $1,109 million (which is net of 15 
percent coinsurance).  At June 30, 1998, Ridge Re had recognized 
approximately $658 million of the available coverage.

The net investment in Insurance at June 30, 1998 totaled $874 
million compared with a balance of $1,076 million at December 31, 
1997.  The decrease primarily reflects the sale of WSG and the 
reserve increase recorded in the first quarter of 1998, somewhat 
offset by contractual payments to Ridge Re for annual premium 
installments and associated finance charges and interest on the 
assigned insurance debt.

Other Financial Services

The net investment in Other Financial Services at June 30, 1998 
was $128 million compared with $125 million at December 31, 1997.

On June 1, 1995, XFSI completed the sale of Xerox Financial 
Services Life Insurance Company and related companies (Xerox 
Life).  In connection with the transaction, OakRe Life Insurance 
Company (OakRe), a wholly-owned XFSI subsidiary, has assumed 
responsibility, via Coinsurance Agreements, for existing Single 
Premium Deferred Annuity (SPDA) policies issued by Xerox Life.  
The Coinsurance Agreements include a provision for the assumption 
(at their election) by the purchaser's companies, of all of the 
SPDA policies at the end of their current rate reset periods.  A 
Novation Agreement with an affiliate of the new owner provides for 
the assumption of the liability under the Coinsurance Agreements 
for any SPDA policies not so assumed.  Other policies (of 
Immediate, Whole Life, and Variable annuities as well as a minor 
amount of SPDAs) were sold and are now the responsibility of the 
purchaser's companies. 
                                      23
<PAGE>
As a result of the Coinsurance Agreements, at June 30, 1998, OakRe 
retained approximately $1.2 billion of investment portfolio assets 
(transferred from Xerox Life) and liabilities related to the 
reinsured SPDA policies.  Interest rates on these policies are 
fixed and were established upon issuance of the respective 
policies.  Substantially all of these policies will reach their 
rate reset periods through the year 2000 and will be assumed under 
the Agreements as described above.  Xerox Life's portfolio was 
designed to recognize that policy renewals extended liability 
"maturities," thereby permitting investments with average duration 
somewhat beyond the rate reset periods.  OakRe's practice is to 
selectively improve this match over time as market conditions 
allow.

In connection with the aforementioned sale, XFSI established a 
$500 million letter of credit and line of credit with a group of 
banks to support OakRe's coinsurance obligations.  The term of 
this letter of credit is five years and it is unused and available 
at June 30, 1998.  Upon a drawing under the letter of credit, XFSI 
has the option to cover the drawing in cash or to draw upon the 
credit line.

Third Party Financing and Real Estate

Third Party Financing and Real Estate assets at June 30, 1998 
totaled $270 million, a $28 million reduction from the December 
31, 1997 level.

                  Capital Resources and Liquidity

Total debt, including ESOP and discontinued operations debt not 
shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets, was $14,671 
million at June 30, 1998 or $1,768 million more than at December 
31, 1998.  The changes in consolidated indebtedness since year-end 
and versus the first six months of 1997 are summarized as follows 
(in millions):

Non-Financing Operations

Operational cash flows are highly seasonal. Due primarily to the 
timing of incentive compensation payments and inventory 
investments, our operations tend to use cash during the first half 
of the year and, then, generate significantly greater amounts of 
cash later in the year.

The following table summarizes Document Processing non-financing 
operations cash generation and borrowing for the six months ended 
June 30, 1998 and 1997 (in millions):

Cash usage during the first half of 1998 was $970 or $551 million 
more than first half 1997 usage.  The year to date loss in 1998 
                                      25
<PAGE>
was more than offset by net non cash charges related to 
restructuring (even after taking into account its $537 million 
impact on deferred taxes) and higher depreciation and 
amortization. However, increased inventory investment in support 
of accelerated digital product sales growth, the settlement of 
compensation obligations, and continued capital investment 
contributed to cash usage on both year to date and period over 
period bases.  All other of $577 million in 1998 was $194 million 
higher than 1997 due largely to an increase in accounts receivable 
and the effects of currency.

Financing Businesses

Financing businesses debt growth of $220 million during the first 
half of 1998 contrasts with a $201 million reduction during the 
first six months of 1997.  The $421 million period over period 
change reflects improved growth in equipment sales, and currency 
translation effects due to a significant strengthening of the U.S. 
dollar against most major European currencies during the first six 
months of 1997.

                         Risk Management

We have entered into certain financial instruments to manage 
interest rate and foreign currency exposures.  These instruments 
are held solely for hedging purposes and include interest rate 
swap agreements, forward exchange contracts and foreign currency 
swap agreements.  We do not enter into derivative instrument 
transactions for trading purposes and employ long-standing 
policies prescribing that derivative instruments are only to be 
used to achieve a set of very limited objectives.

Currency derivatives are primarily arranged in conjunction with 
underlying transactions that give rise to foreign currency-
denominated payables and receivables; for example, an option to 
buy foreign currency to settle the importation of goods from 
suppliers, or a forward exchange contract to fix the U.S. dollar 
value of a foreign currency-denominated loan.  In addition, when 
cost-effective, currency derivatives may be used to hedge balance 
sheet exposures.

Revenues denominated in currencies where the local currency is the 
functional currency are not hedged.

With regard to interest rate hedging, virtually all customer 
financing assets earn fixed rates of interest and, therefore, we 
"lock in" an interest rate spread by arranging fixed-rate 
liabilities with similar maturities as the underlying assets.  
Additionally, customer financing assets in one currency are 
consistently funded with liabilities in the same currency.  We 
refer to the effect of these conservative practices as "match 
funding" customer financing assets. This practice effectively 
eliminates the risk of a major decline in interest margins 
                                      26
<PAGE>
resulting from adverse changes in the interest rate environment.  
Conversely, this practice effectively eliminates the opportunity 
to materially increase margins when interest rates are declining.

More specifically, pay fixed-rate and receive variable-rate swaps 
are typically used in place of more expensive fixed-rate debt.  
Pay variable-rate and receive variable-rate swaps are used to 
transform variable-rate medium-term debt into commercial paper or 
LIBOR obligations.  Additionally, pay variable-rate and receive 
fixed-rate swaps are used from time to time to transform longer-
term fixed-rate debt into commercial paper or LIBOR obligations. 
The transactions performed within each of these three categories 
enable cost-effective management of interest rate exposures.  The 
potential risk attendant to this strategy is the non-performance 
of a swap counterparty.  We address this risk by arranging swaps 
exclusively with a diverse group of strong-credit counterparties, 
regularly monitoring their credit ratings, and determining the 
replacement cost, if any, of existing transactions.

Our currency and interest rate hedging is typically unaffected by 
changes in market conditions as forward contracts, options and 
swaps are normally held to maturity consistent with our objective 
to lock in currency rates and interest rate spreads on the 
underlying transactions.

(1) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on the 
    Company's continuing operations by dividing total earnings available for 
    fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest and preferred stock
    dividends of subsidiaries, by total fixed charges.  Fixed charges consist
    of interest, including capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends
    of subsidiaries, and one-third of rent expense as representative of the
    interest portion of rentals.  Debt has been assigned to discontinued
    operations based on historical levels assigned to the businesses when
    they were continuing operations, adjusted for subsequent paydowns.
    Discontinued operations consist of the Company's Insurance, Other
    Financial Services, and Third Party Financing and Real Estate businesses.

(2) The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of 
    the Company's finance subsidiaries, which primarily finance Xerox 
    equipment.  Financing businesses are more highly leveraged and,
    therefore, tend to operate at lower earnings to fixed charges ratio 
    levels than do non-financial businesses.

*   Earnings for the six months of 1998 were inadequate to cover fixed charges.
    The coverage deficiency was $676 million.  Excluding the restructuring
    charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would be 3.25.

**  1993 earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges.  The coverage 
    deficiency was $249 million.

*** Sum of "Income (Loss) before Income Taxes (Benefits), Equity Income and
    Minorities' Interests" and "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates."
