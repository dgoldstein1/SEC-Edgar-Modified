ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

       CISCO SYSTEMS PROVIDES DETAIL ON PROVISION FOR LOSSES IN FORM 10-Q
                QUARTERLY REPORT FOR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001

Cisco Systems is providing certain detail regarding its provision for losses
included in the cash flow statement in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for its
first quarter of fiscal 2001 ended October 28, 2000 (the "Form 10-Q"), filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on December 12, 2000.

The provision for losses in the Form 10-Q reflects three separate accounting
reserves: (i) a provision for doubtful accounts, (ii) a provision for inventory
reserves, and (iii) a provision for losses on minority investments. The
following table provides further detail regarding these provisions (in
millions):

Provision for doubtful accounts                      $  14         $  5
Provision for inventory reserves                       143           70
Provision for losses on minority investments           118           --
                                                   -----------  -----------
  Total                                              $ 275         $ 75
                                                   ===========  ===========
</TABLE>

The provision for doubtful accounts reflects the additional amount reserved
during the first quarter for future or anticipated losses relating to trade
accounts receivable. During the first quarter of fiscal 2001, the additional
amount reserved was approximately $14 million. The accumulated allowance for
doubtful accounts reserve was approximately $57 million, or 1.9 percent of trade
accounts receivable, at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2001, as compared
to approximately $43 million, or 1.8 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2000.

As discussed during Cisco's earnings call for the first quarter of fiscal 2001
and its Form 10-Q, we have continued to increase our inventory levels to reduce
lead times and reduce risks associated with current component shortages in our
supply chain. The increase in the provision for inventory reserves directly
correlates to the increase in our inventory balance.

The increase in the provision for losses on minority investments reflects an
increase in our reserve for potential losses related to our minority equity
investment portfolio. We continue to make minority equity investments in
start-up technology companies to gain access to innovative technologies. These
investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products
these start-up companies have under development are typically in the early
stages and may never materialize. We routinely review our investment portfolio
for possible impairment of individual investments. At the end of the first
quarter of fiscal 2001, we had an unrealized gain of approximately $3.8 billion
on our total investment portfolio.
