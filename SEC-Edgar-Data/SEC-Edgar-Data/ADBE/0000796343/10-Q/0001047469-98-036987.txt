                NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES         

     BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements of
Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe" or the "Company") have been prepared in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, consistent in all
material respects with those applied in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended November 28, 1997. The interim financial information is
unaudited but reflects all normal adjustments which are, in the opinion of
management, necessary to provide fair condensed consolidated balance sheets and
condensed consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the interim
periods presented. The interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended November 28, 1997.

     The results of operations for the interim period ended August 28, 1998, are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.

     REVENUE RECOGNITION

     In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." SOP
97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of
software revenue. Based on the Company's ongoing assessment of the impact SOP
97-2 may have on its consolidated results of operations, the Company is
modifying certain aspects of its business model such that any impact will not be
significant. The Company will adopt SOP 97-2 for its fiscal year 1999.

     COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

     In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS
No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards
for reporting and displaying comprehensive income and its components in the
financial statements. It does not, however, require a specific format for the
disclosure but requires the Company to display an amount representing total
comprehensive income for the periods presented in its financial statements. The
Company will be required to implement SFAS No. 130 for its first quarter of
fiscal year 1999.

     SEGMENT REPORTING

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of
an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes standards for
the manner in which public companies report information about operating segments
in annual and interim financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating
the operating segment information to determine whether this will have an impact
on its financial statement reporting. The Company will be required to implement
SFAS No. 131 for its fiscal year 1999.

NOTE 1.   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
     
     DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and
reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
and requires the Company to recognize all derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value. Gains and
losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for depending on
the use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge
accounting. The Company will be required to implement SFAS No. 133 for its
fiscal year 2000. The Company has not determined the impact that SFAS No. 133
will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination will
not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption.

     RECLASSIFICATIONS
     
     Certain amounts in the 1997 Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash 
Flows have been reclassified to conform to the 1998 presentation.

NOTE 2.   OTHER ASSETS
          
     Other assets consisted of the following:

NOTE 4.   RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES

     In the third quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company implemented a
restructuring program aimed at streamlining its underlying cost structure to
better position the Company for growth and profitability. As part of the
restructuring program, the Company implemented a reduction in force of
approximately 350 positions, for the most part in its North American operations.
The reductions came primarily from overhead areas, divested business units and
redundant marketing activities, and as of August 31, 1998, the majority of these
terminations were completed. In addition to severance and related charges
associated with the reduction in force, the restructuring program includes
charges for divesting two business units, vacating leased facilities and
canceling certain contracts. These actions and other non-recurring items
resulted in charges of $37.9 million, of which approximately $9.3 million were
non-cash charges. Of the $28.6 million in anticipated cash charges, $20.4
million remains accrued at August 28, 1998, and will be paid over the next
twelve months and financed through current working capital.

</TABLE>

     The Company divested two business units with aggregate net assets of 
approximately $6.0 million, including cash of $3.8 million, in exchange for 
$2.5 million in notes receivable and future royalties. The Company fully 
offset the notes receivable with an allowance for doubtful accounts due to 
uncertainties in collection. The two business units generated combined annual 
revenues of approximately $25 million. Operating losses associated with these 
two business units were not material. 

     Canceled contracts relate primarily to the divestiture of the two business
units and the termination of certain corporate marketing programs.

     Other non-recurring charges primarily include the write-off of fixed assets
as a result of a book-to-physical inventory adjustment and goodwill relating to
a business in Japan that is in the process of restructuring its business
function. 

     Approximately $8.4 million in accrued restructuring costs remained as of 
November 28, 1997 in connection with the mergers with Aldus and Frame in 
fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1995, respectively. During fiscal 1998 lease payments 
of $1.1 million were made against the accrual and, as a result of the 
renegotiation of certain facility leases and the sublease of certain 
facilities in fiscal 1998, $3.2 million of the restructuring accrual related 
to the Aldus and Frame acquisitions was reversed in the third quarter of 
fiscal 1998. The remaining accrual of $4.2 million at August 28, 1998 relates 
to lease termination costs primarily in Europe.

NOTE 6.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

     STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS     

     In September 1997, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject to
certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to an additional 15
million shares of the Company's common stock over a two-year period. This new
stock repurchase program was in addition to an existing program, whereby the
Company has been authorized to repurchase shares to offset issuances under
employee stock option and stock purchase plans. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1997 and the first nine months of fiscal 1998, the Company repurchased
approximately 4.7 and 3.7 million shares of its common stock, respectively. As
of August 28, 1998, management is authorized to repurchase an additional 7.7
million shares under the 15 million share repurchase program.

     PUT WARRANTS AND CALL OPTIONS

     To facilitate the Company's stock repurchase programs, the Company sold put
warrants to independent third parties. Each warrant entitles the holder to sell
one share of Adobe's common stock to the Company at a specified price. On August
28, 1998, put warrants to sell

NOTE 6.   STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)

approximately 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock were 
outstanding that expire on various dates through February 1999 with an 
average exercise price of $40.67 per share. Under these put warrant 
arrangements, the Company, at its option, can settle with physical delivery 
or net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and market 
value at the date of exercise. 

     In addition, the Company purchased call options from independent third 
parties that entitle the Company to buy its common stock on certain dates at 
specified prices. On August 28, 1998, call options to purchase approximately 
128,000 shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding that expire on 
various dates through February 1999 with an average exercise price of $29.79 
per share.

NOTE 7.   COMMITMENTS

     During the third quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company engaged two 
investment banking firms to assist with responding to an unsolicited 
acquisition proposal. As part of the agreement, the Company is required to 
pay advisory fees of approximately $13.0 million, of which approximately 
$12.0 million remains to be paid over the next two years. In the event that 
the Company terminates either of the firms' services, the Company is still 
committed to pay advisory fees until its obligation is fulfilled.

NOTE 8.   SUBSEQUENT EVENT

     STOCK OPTION REPRICING

     In order to address concerns regarding employee retention, on September 
23, 1998, the Board of Directors approved a stock option repricing program 
whereby each eligible underwater stock option was automatically amended to 
have an exercise price equal to the Company's closing stock price on that 
day. All other terms of the options, including expiration dates, remain 
substantially the same. Approximately 5 million options were amended under 
this repricing program.

</TABLE>

     Total revenue decreased 3.1% and 5.4% in the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal 1998, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in
fiscal 1997. The weakness in the Japanese economy and a decrease in licensing
revenue were the principal factors in the Company's revenue decline.

     As part of the Company's restructuring program announced and implemented in
the third quarter of fiscal 1998, two business units were divested which
generated combined annual revenues of approximately $25 million. The Company has
targeted annual revenue growth from its ongoing businesses of approximately 15%
as compared to fiscal 1998 reported revenue.

         Percentage of total revenue        19.3%          21.9%
</TABLE>

     Licensing revenue is derived from shipments by OEM customers of products 
containing Adobe PostScript technology. Adobe PostScript is a software 
language for describing to a printer the appearance of a page, including 
text, graphics, and images. Products that contain PostScript technology 
include: (1) black-and-white printers; (2) color printers; (3) slide 
recorders; (4) imagesetters; (5) screen displays; and (6) digital copiers. 
Adobe PostScript technology includes Adobe PostScript, Adobe PostScript Level 
2, Adobe PostScript 3, and Adobe PostScript Extreme, all of which serve the 
enterprise, graphic arts, production printing, small office/home office 
markets, and high-volume production printing markets. 

            Licensing revenue decreased $4.4 million or 9.6% in the third 
quarter of fiscal 1998 compared to the same quarter last year and $24.8 
million or 16.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 1998 compared to the same 
period in 1997 primarily due to weakness in the Japanese personal computer 
and printer markets and a reduction in royalty revenue from Hewlett-Packard 
Company's ("HP") desktop monochrome laser printer division which is now 
incorporating a non-Adobe clone version of Adobe PostScript into some of its 
products. 

                                     15
<PAGE>

     The Company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue in the 
short term due to weak Japanese market conditions and uncertain timing of OEM 
customer introductions of products incorporating Adobe's latest technologies. 
Based on a strategic review of the Company's printing systems business, the 
Company is now focusing its resources on high growth revenue opportunities in 
digital color, color inkjet, short-run on-demand digital printing, and 
digital copiers. This strategic focus is intended to increase licensing 
revenue growth in the long term, although the Company anticipates that its 
licensing revenue in the remainder of fiscal 1998 will continue to be below 
fiscal 1997 levels.

         Percentage of total revenue        80.7%          78.1%

</TABLE>

     Applications products revenue is derived predominantly from shipments of
application software programs marketed through distribution channels, with the
exception of Adobe PhotoDeluxe, which is primarily distributed through OEM
bundling agreements with digital camera, scanner, and personal computer
manufacturers. 

     Applications products revenue decreased $2.8 million or 1.5% in the 
third quarter of fiscal 1998 compared to the same period last year due to a 
decline in Adobe Illustrator and PageMaker  revenues as the market  
anticipates new releases of these products and due to ongoing weakness in the 
Japanese economy. The decline in revenue was partially offset by increased 
sales of Photoshop and revenue growth from the Company's video products, 
Acrobat products, and ImageReady, the Company's new product for designing 
images on the Internet.

     For the first nine months of fiscal 1998, applications products revenue 
decreased $12.0 million or 2.2% compared to the same period last year 
primarily due to weakness in the Japanese economy and a continuing decline in 
applications product revenue from the Macintosh platform.

     Direct costs include product packaging, third party royalties, amortization
of localization costs and acquired technologies, and reserves for excess and
obsolete inventory. Direct costs were lower in the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal 1998 compared with the same periods last year due to lower
royalty expenses and less product inventory requiring reserves for obsolescence.

     Gross margin (expressed as a percentage of revenue), in general, is
affected by the mix of licensing revenue versus applications products revenue as
well as the product mix within application products and the mix of full and
upgrade products sold.

</TABLE>

     Research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and
benefits for software developers, contracted development efforts, related
facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in
software development.

     Research and development expenses increased in the third quarter and first
nine months of fiscal 1998 compared with the same periods last year due to
increased investment in new technologies, new product development, and the
infrastructure to support such activities. The increase reflects the expansion
of the Company's engineering staff and related costs required to support its
continued emphasis on developing new products and enhancing existing products.
The Company continues to make significant investments in development of its
software products, including those targeted for the growing Internet market.

     Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 
are expected to decrease in absolute dollars from the third quarter of fiscal 
1998 as a result of the Company's restructuring program.  Research and 
development expenses beyond the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 are expected to 
increase in absolute dollars as the Company believes that continued 
investments in research and development, including the recruiting and hiring 
of software developers, are necessary to remain competitive in the 
marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new 
and enhanced products.

marketing expenses also include the costs of programs aimed at increasing
revenue, such as advertising, trade shows and other market development programs.

     Sales and marketing expenses increased in the third quarter of fiscal 1998
compared to the same period last year due to higher employee costs, trade show
expenses and customer support costs. 

     For the first nine months of fiscal 1998 compared with the same period last
year, sales and marketing expenses increased due to advertising and promotional
expenditures in connection with new product releases and sales and marketing
staff to support a growing number of products and customers. 

     Sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 are
expected to decrease in absolute dollars from the third quarter of fiscal 1998
as a result of the Company's restructuring program. Sales and marketing expenses
beyond the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 are expected to increase in absolute
dollars to support future revenue growth.

     General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and

resources, legal, information services, and administrative personnel of the
Company. General and administrative expenses also include outside legal and
accounting fees, bad debts, and expenses associated with computer equipment and
software used in the administration of the business.

                                     18
<PAGE>

     General and administrative expenses increased $5.7 million or 30% for the
third quarter of fiscal 1998 compared with the same period last year due to
increased expenses for outside legal and investment banking services in
connection with responding to an unsolicited acquisition proposal, increased
employee costs, and higher depreciation and building expenses associated with
increased staff and a more comprehensive administrative infrastructure. In
addition, the provision for losses on accounts receivable increased to reserve
for accounts receivable from certain customers which were deemed potentially
uncollectible. 
 
     For the first nine months of fiscal 1998 compared to the same period 
last year, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher legal 
and investment banking expenses, employee expenses and related depreciation 
and building expenses associated with increased staff. Additionally, general 
and administrative expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 1998 include 
the write-off of $2.4 million of goodwill associated with an acquisition that 
took place in fiscal 1997. These increased expenses were partially offset by 
the reversal of an executive incentive bonus program accrual that was based 
on various revenue and operating margin targets that were not attained.

     General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998
are expected to decrease in absolute dollars from the third quarter of fiscal
1998 as a result of the Company's restructuring program. General and
administrative expenses beyond the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 are expected to
increase in absolute dollars to support future infrastructure needs and also due
to continuing commitments resulting from the Company's response to an
unsolicited acquisition proposal during the third quarter of fiscal 1998.

Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed," and for which no alternative uses have 
been established by the Company.

     The Company acquired two software companies during the first nine months 
of fiscal 1997 and accounted for the transactions using the purchase method. 
The aggregate purchase price of the companies was principally allocated to 
in-process research and development, and was therefore expensed at the time 
of the acquisitions.

</TABLE>

     In the third quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company implemented a
restructuring program aimed at streamlining its underlying cost structure to
better position the Company for growth and profitability. As part of the
restructuring program, the Company implemented a reduction in force of
approximately 350 positions, for the most part in its North American operations.
The reductions came primarily from overhead areas, divested business units and
redundant marketing activities, and as of August 31, 1998, the majority of these
terminations were completed. In addition to severance and related charges
associated with the reduction in force, the restructuring program includes
charges for divesting two business units, vacating leased facilities and
canceling certain contracts. These actions and other non-recurring items
resulted in charges of $37.9 million, of which approximately $9.3 million were
non-cash charges. For further information regarding the Company's restructuring
program, see Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited) included in Part I of this Quarterly Report. In the third quarter of
fiscal 1997, restructuring and other charges included a charge related to the
acquisition of intellectual property.

     In addition to the aforementioned items, included in restructuring and 
other charges for the first nine months of fiscal 1998 are expenses 
associated with the reduction in force in the Company's Printing and Systems 
business as part of the Company's initiative to refocus resources on 
high-growth opportunities in the printing and digital copier markets. The 
first nine months of fiscal 1997 also include a net gain on the divestiture 
of a product line. 

     The Company currently does not anticipate further restructuring charges 
during the remainder of fiscal 1998 as it completes its restructuring 
program. As a result of the restructuring program, the Company's expense base 
was reduced by approximately $60 million on an annualized basis. The majority 
of cost savings are expected to be realized as a result of lower headcount, 
reduced facility costs and terminated marketing programs. Beyond the fourth 
quarter of fiscal 1998, these cost savings are expected to be offset by 
increased operating expenses to support future revenue growth.

</TABLE>

     Investment gain consists principally of realized gains or losses from
direct investments as well as mark-to-market valuation adjustments for Adobe
Ventures L.P. investments.

     During the third quarter of fiscal 1998, gains and losses resulting from
investment activity were minimal. In the third quarter of fiscal 1997,
investment gain included a $20.3 million gain for the distribution to
stockholders of 554,553 shares of Netscape Communications Corporation
("Netscape") stock as a stock dividend, and a gain of $7.3 million for the sale
of 200,000 shares of Netscape stock, both of which were partially offset by
losses from direct investments. 

     For the first nine months of fiscal 1998, the investment gain consists
principally of two transactions.  McQueen International Limited ("McQueen"), a
former investee of the Company, was acquired by Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated
("Sykes"), a publicly traded company. In connection with the acquisition, the
Company exchanged its shares of McQueen for approximately 487,000 shares of
Sykes' restricted common stock and recorded a gain on the exchange of $6.7
million. In the third quarter of 1998, these shares were sold and an additional
minimal gain was recorded. In addition, the Company liquidated its investment in
Siebel Systems, Incorporated ("Siebel") through the distribution to its
stockholders of approximately 165,000 shares of Siebel as a dividend-in-kind and
the sale of its remaining Siebel shares. A gain was recognized on the
transaction of approximately $5.7 million.

     The decrease in interest and other income in the third quarter and the 
first nine months of fiscal 1998 compared with the same periods last year is 
due to lower average cash and short-term investment balances in 1998, 
primarily as a result of stock repurchases in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
1997 and the first nine months of fiscal 1998.

         Effective tax rate                 37.3%          36.9%

</TABLE>

     The Company's effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 1998 
was lower than the same period in fiscal 1997 primarily as a result of the 
non-deductible in-process research and development charges incurred in the 
third quarter of fiscal 1997.

     In the first nine months of fiscal 1998, the Company's effective tax rate 
increased primarily due to the non-deductible write-off of goodwill relating 
to a fiscal 1997 acquisition, a decrease in research and experimentation tax 
credits (the federal credit expired on June 30, 1998), and lower tax-exempt 
interest income.

     The Company expects that the effective tax rate for the remainder of 
fiscal 1998 will be between 37% and 38% due to lower tax-exempt interest 
income as a result of cash requirements for the Company's stock repurchase 
programs and due to the expiration of the federal research and 
experimentation tax credit on June 30, 1998.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The Company believes that in the future its results of operations could 
be affected by various factors, such as delays in shipment of the Company's 
new products and major new versions of existing products, lack of market 
acceptance of new products and upgrades, weakness in demand for Macintosh 
application software and Macintosh-related printers, renegotiation of royalty 
arrangements, growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales and 
sales price adjustments, consolidation in the OEM printer business, ongoing 
weakness in the color copier business due to product transitions, industry 
transitions to new business and information delivery models, ongoing weakness 
in the Japanese and other Asian economies, "Year 2000" issues, and adverse 
changes in general economic conditions in any of the countries in which the 
Company does business.

     The Company has stated that in fiscal 1999 its annual revenue growth 
target is 15% and its operating margin target is 25% of total revenue.  These 
targets are used to assist the Company's management in making decisions about 
the allocation of resources and investments, not as predictions of future 
results.  The targets reflect a number of assumptions, including assumptions

                                   22
<PAGE>


about the Company's pricing, manufacturing costs and volumes, and the mix of 
application products and licensing revenue, full and upgrade products, 
distribution channels and geographic distribution. These and many other 
factors described herein affect the Company's financial performance and may 
cause the Company's future results, including results for the current 
quarter, to vary materially from these targets.

     The Company's ability to develop and market products, including upgrades 
of current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs, may 
also have an impact on the results of operations. The Company's ability to 
extend its core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or 
respond to technological changes could affect its ability to develop these 
products. A portion of the Company's future revenue will come from these new 
applications. Delays in product or upgrade introductions, whether by the 
Company or its OEM customers, could have an adverse effect on the Company's 
revenue, earnings, or stock price. The Company cannot determine the ultimate 
effect that these new products or upgrades will have on its revenue or 
results of operations.

     The market for the Company's graphics applications, particularly the 
consumer products, is intensely and increasingly competitive and is 
significantly affected by product introductions and market activities of 
industry competitors. Additionally, Microsoft Corporation has stated its 
intention to increase its presence in the digital imaging/graphics market by 
mid-1999; the Company believes that, due to Microsoft's market dominance, any 
new Microsoft digital imaging products will be highly competitive with the 
Company's products. If competing new products achieve widespread acceptance, 
it would have a significant adverse impact on the Company's operating results.

     Although the Company generally offers its application products on 
Macintosh, Windows, and UNIX platforms, a majority of the overall revenue 
from these products prior to fiscal 1997 has been from the Macintosh 
platform, particularly for the higher end Macintosh computers. In fiscal 
1997, Windows-based application revenue exceeded that from the Macintosh 
platform for the first time, and for the past several quarters, Macintosh 
platform sales of application products have continued to decline year over 
year while Windows platform sales have continued to rise. If there is a 
continuing slowdown of customer purchases in the higher end Macintosh market, 
or if the Company is unable to continue to increase its revenue from Windows 
customers commensurate with such a slowdown, the Company's operating results 
could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that there 
is a slowdown of customer purchases of personal computers in general, the 
Company's operating results could be materially adversely affected. Also, as 
the Company seeks to further broaden its customer base to achieve greater 
penetration in the corporate business and consumer markets, the Company may 
not successfully adapt its application software distribution channels, which 
could materially adversely affect the Company's operating results. The 
Company could experience decreases in average selling prices and some 
transitions in its distribution channels that could materially adversely 
affect its operating results. 

     The Company continues to expand into third-party distribution channels, 
including value-added resellers and systems integrators, in its effort to 
further broaden its customer base.  As a result, the financial health of 
these third parties, and the Company's continuing relationships with them, 
are becoming more important to the Company's success. Some of these companies 
are thinly capitalized and may be unable to withstand changes in business 
conditions. The Company's financial results could be adversely affected if 
the financial condition of certain of these third parties substantially 
weakens or if the Company's relationships with them deteriorate.

     The Company's OEM customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their 
royalty arrangements. The Company evaluates these requests on a case-by-case 
basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other 
options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for 

                                 23
<PAGE>

the Company. In the fall of fiscal 1997, HP began to ship non-Adobe 
PostScript clone software in some printers, resulting in lower licensing 
revenue to the Company in fiscal 1998, even though the Company continues to 
work with HP printer operations to incorporate Adobe PostScript and other 
technologies in other HP products. The Company expects lower licensing 
revenue from HP during the remainder of fiscal 1998.

     During late fiscal 1997 and the first nine months of fiscal 1998, the 
Company experienced a decline in both application and licensing revenue from 
the Japanese market due to a weak Japanese computer market and general 
economic conditions in Japan. In addition, at the end of fiscal 1997, 
inventory levels for applications products at the Company's Japanese 
distributors remained higher than what the Company considers normal. During 
fiscal 1998, the Company worked with its major distributors in Japan to 
reduce channel inventory to what the Company considers a reasonable level. 
The Company expects these adverse economic conditions to continue in the 
short term, and they may continue to adversely affect the Company's revenue 
and earnings. Although there are also adverse conditions in other Asian 
economies, the countries affected represent a much smaller portion of the 
Company's revenue and thus have less impact on the Company's operational 
results. 

     The Company has recently implemented a restructuring of its business and 
reduced its workforce by more than ten percent. However, the Company plans to 
continue to invest in certain areas, which will require it to hire additional 
employees. Competition for high quality personnel, especially highly skilled 
engineers, is extremely intense. The Company's ability to effectively manage 
its growth will require it to continue to improve its operational and 
financial controls and information management systems, and to attract, 
retain, motivate, and manage employees effectively.  The failure of the 
Company to effectively manage growth and transition in multiple areas of its 
business could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.

     The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an 
increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed 
products addressing authoring and communications over the Internet. As is 
typical in the case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market 
acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a 
high level of uncertainty. The software industry addressing authoring and 
communications over the Internet is young and has few proven products. In 
addition, new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new 
information delivery practices. Moreover, critical issues concerning the 
commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, ease of use 
and access, cost, and quality of service) remain unresolved and may affect 
the growth of Internet use, together with the software standards and 
electronic media employed in such markets.

     The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating 
income from its subsidiaries located in Europe, Japan, and Asia, Pacific, and 
Latin America. The Company generally experiences lower revenue from its 
European operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their 
purchasing activities in the summer months. Additionally, the Company is 
uncertain whether the recent weakness experienced in the Japan and Asia, 
Pacific and Latin America markets will continue in the foreseeable future due 
to extreme currency devaluation and liquidity problems in these regions. 
While most of the revenue of the European subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. 
dollars, the majority of revenue derived from Japan is denominated in yen and 
the majority of all subsidiaries' operating expenses are denominated in their 
local currencies. As a result, the Company's operating results are subject to 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, the accounting 
impact of such fluctuations has been insignificant. The Company's hedging 
policy attempts to mitigate some of these risks, based on management's best 
judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity, and expense. 
The Company has established a hedging program to hedge its exposure to 
foreign currency

                                  24
<PAGE>

exchange rate fluctuations, primarily of the Japanese yen. The Company's 
hedging program is not comprehensive, and there can be no assurance that the 
program will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact 
resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates.

     On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the 
European Union are scheduled to adopt the euro as their common legal currency 
and to establish fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign 
currencies and the euro. The euro will then trade on currency exchanges and 
be available for non-cash transactions. Based on its preliminary assessment, 
the Company does not believe the conversion will have a material impact on 
the competitiveness of its products in Europe, where there already exists 
substantial price transparency, or increase the likelihood of contract 
cancellations. Further, the Company expects that modifications to comply with 
euro requirements will be made to its business operations and systems on a 
timely basis and does not believe that the cost of such modifications will 
have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations or 
financial condition. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company 
will be able to complete such modifications on a timely basis; any failure to 
do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of 
operations or financial condition. In addition, the Company faces risks to 
the extent that suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and other vendors upon 
whom the Company relies and their suppliers are unable to make appropriate 
modifications to support euro transactions. The inability of such third 
parties to support euro transactions could have a material adverse effect on 
the Company's results of operations or financial condition.
 
     Due to the factors noted above, the Company's future earnings and stock 
price may be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly 
basis. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by 
securities analysts could have, and has had in the past, an immediate and 
significant adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's common stock 
in any given period. Additionally, the Company may not learn of such 
shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter, which could result in an even 
more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the Company's 
common stock. Finally, the Company participates in a highly dynamic industry. 
In addition to factors specific to the Company, changes in analysts' earnings 
estimates for the Company or its industry and factors affecting the corporate 
environment, the Company's industry or the securities markets in general will 
often result in significant volatility of the Company's common stock price.

"YEAR 2000" ISSUES

     The Company is aware of and is addressing a broad range of issues 
associated with the programming code in existing computer systems as the year 
2000 approaches. The "Year 2000" problem is complex, as many computer systems 
will be affected in some way by the rollover of the two-digit year value to 
00. Systems that do not properly recognize such information could generate 
erroneous data or cause a system to fail. The "Year 2000" issue creates risk 
for the Company from unforeseen problems in its own computer and embedded 
systems and from third parties with whom the Company deals on financial and 
other transactions worldwide. Failure of the Company's and/or third parties' 
computer systems could have a material impact on the Company's ability to 
conduct its business.
 
     The Company's financial information systems include an SAP system 
recently implemented in the United States, Japan and Asia, Pacific and Latin 
America, and an Oracle system in Europe which was upgraded to the most recent 
version in fiscal 1998. These systems are believed to be "Year 2000" 
compliant. The Company has substantially completed inventorying and analyzing 
its remaining centralized computer and embedded systems to identify any 
potential Year 2000 issues and will take appropriate corrective action based 
on the results of such analysis. The Company has a number of projects 
underway to replace or upgrade hardware and software that

                                     25
<PAGE>

are known to be Year 2000 non-compliant.  For the Year 2000 non-compliance 
issues identified to date, the cost of remediation is currently not expected 
to be material to the Company's operating results. The Company currently 
expects to substantially complete remediation and validation of its internal 
systems, as well as to develop contingency plans for certain internal 
systems, by mid-1999. However, if implementation of replacement upgraded 
systems or software is delayed, if significant new non-compliance issues are 
identified, or if contingency plans fail, the Company's results of operations 
or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

     The Company is also in the process of contacting its critical suppliers,
manufacturers, distributors, and other vendors to determine if their
operations and the products and services that they provide to the Company are
Year 2000 compliant.  Where practicable, the Company will attempt to mitigate
its risks with respect to the failure of third parties to be Year 2000 ready,
including developing contingency plans where practicable. However, such
failures, including failures of any contingency plans, remain a possibility and
could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations or
financial condition.
                                          
     In addition, the "Year 2000" issue could affect the products that the
Company sells. The Company believes that the current versions of its products
are "Year 2000" compliant. However there can be no assurance that the Company's
current products do not contain undetected errors or defects associated with
Year 2000 that may result in material costs to the Company. Some commentators
have stated that a significant amount of litigation will arise out of Year 2000
compliance issues, and the Company is aware of a growing number of lawsuits
against other software vendors.  Because of the unprecedented nature of such
litigation, it is uncertain whether and to what extent the Company may be
affected by it.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

     In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." SOP
97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of
software revenue. Based on the Company's ongoing assessment of the impact SOP
97-2 may have on its consolidated results of operations, the Company is
modifying certain aspects of its business model such that any impact will not be
significant. The Company intends to adopt SOP 97-2 for its fiscal year 1999.

     In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. It does
not, however, require a specific format for the disclosure, but requires the
Company to display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the
periods presented in its financial statements. The Company will be required to
implement SFAS No. 130 for its fiscal year 1999.

     Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes
standards for the manner in which public companies report information about
operating segments in annual and interim financial statements. The Company is
currently evaluating the operating segment information to determine whether this
will have an impact on its financial statement reporting. The Company will be
required to implement SFAS No. 131 for its fiscal year 1999.

    In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative 
Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and 
reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and for hedging 
activities and requires the Company to recognize all derivatives as either 
assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair value. 
Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value would be accounted for 
depending on the 

                                26
<PAGE>

use of the derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge
accounting. The Company will be required to implement SFAS No. 133 for its
fiscal year 2000. The Company has not determined the impact that SFAS No. 133
will have on its financial statements and believes that such determination
will not be meaningful until closer to the date of initial adoption.

</TABLE>

     The Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, 
consisting principally of municipal bonds, auction rate securities, and 
United States government and government agency securities, decreased $59.7 
million or 11.9% during the first nine months of fiscal 1998. All of the 
Company's short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale under 
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, 
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." The 
securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, 
net of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

     Major sources of cash during the first nine months of fiscal 1998 
included cash generated from operations of $144.7 million and proceeds from 
the issuance of common stock primarily related to the exercise of stock 
options and sale of stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Program of $51.8 
million. Major uses of cash during the period included $138.2 million to 
repurchase Adobe common stock (net of put premiums received), net purchases 
of short-term investments of $25.6 million, additions to other assets of 
$47.5 million, capital expenditures totaling $52.7 million, and the payment 
of dividends of $13.0 million.

     During the third quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company engaged two 
investment banking firms to assist with responding to an unsolicited 
acquisition proposal. As part of these agreements, the Company is required to 
pay advisory fees of approximately $13.0 million, of which $12.0 million 
remains to be paid over the next two years. In the event that the Company 
terminates either of the firms' services, the Company is still committed to 
pay advisory fees until its obligation is fulfilled.

     In September 1997, the Company's Board of Directors authorized, subject to
certain business and market conditions, the purchase of up to an additional 15
million shares of the Company's common stock over a two-year period. This new
stock repurchase program was in addition to an existing program, whereby the
Company has been authorized to repurchase shares to offset issuances under
employee stock option and stock purchase plans. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1997 and the first nine months of fiscal 1998, the Company repurchased
approximately 4.7 and 3.7 million shares of its common stock, respectively. As
of August 28, 1998, management is authorized to repurchase an additional 7.7
million shares under the 15 million share repurchase program. These stock
repurchase programs are intended to enhance


                                      27
<PAGE>

stockholder value by reducing the number of outstanding shares net of
offsetting increases due to employee stock purchases and stock option
exercises. The timing and size of any future stock repurchases are subject to
market conditions, stock prices and Adobe's cash position and other cash
requirements going forward.

     To facilitate the Company's stock repurchase programs, the Company sold put
warrants to independent third parties. Each warrant entitles the holder to sell
one share of Adobe's common stock to the Company at a specified price. On August
28, 1998, put warrants to sell approximately 1.4 million shares of the Company's
common stock were outstanding that expire on various dates through February 1999
with an average exercise price of $40.67 per share. Under these put warrant
arrangements, the Company, at its option, can settle with physical delivery or
net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and market value
at the date of exercise.

     In addition, the Company purchased call options from independent third
parties that entitle the Company to buy its common stock on certain dates at
specified prices. On August 28, 1998, call options to purchase approximately
128,000 shares of the Company's common stock were outstanding that expire on
various dates through February 1999 with an average exercise price of $29.79 per
share.

     The Board of Directors of the Company declared three cash dividends on the
Company's common stock of $.05 per common share, one for each of the first,
second and third quarters of 1998. Also, on December 1, 1997, the Company
dividended one share of Siebel Systems, Incorporated ("Siebel") common stock for
each 300 shares of Adobe common stock held by stockholders of record on October
31, 1997. An equivalent cash dividend was paid for holdings of less than 7,500
Adobe shares and for odd-lot and fractional Siebel shares. The declaration of
future dividends is within the discretion of the Board of Directors of the
Company and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, the
financial condition of the Company and other factors.

     Expenditures for property and equipment are expected to continue as staff
increases and as the Company continues the construction of a facility in Europe.
Furthermore, additional cash may be used to acquire software products or
technologies complementary to the Company's business.

     In addition to commitments related to an unsolicited acquisition proposal,
the Company's principal commitments as of August 28, 1998 consisted of
obligations under operating leases, venture investing activities, real estate
development agreements, and various service agreements.  These arrangements are
discussed in more detail in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended November 28, 1997.

     The Company believes that existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, together with cash generated from operations, will provide
sufficient funds for the Company to meet its operating cash requirements in the
foreseeable future, including planned capital expenditure programs, working
capital requirements, the potential put warrant obligation, the dividend
program, and obligations under the restructuring program announced and
implemented during the third quarter of fiscal 1998.

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company's market risk disclosures set forth in Item 7a of its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 28, 1997 have not changed
significantly.

PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On April 17, 1997, a derivative action was filed in the Superior Court
of the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against the current
members of Adobe's Board of Directors and Paul Brainerd, a former member of
the Board. The suit was filed by a stockholder purporting to assert on behalf
of the Company claims for alleged breach of the Directors' fiduciary duty and
mismanagement related to the Company's acquisition of Frame in October 1995.
The Court granted Adobe's demurrer to the suit, with leave to amend for the
plaintiff. In January 1998, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint making
substantially the same claims but not including Mr. Brainerd. In March 1998,
Adobe filed a demurrer to the amended complaint, which was overruled by the
trial court in May 1998. In June 1998, Adobe filed a writ petition with the
California Court of Appeals for review of the trial court's decision, which
was denied.  In July 1998, Adobe filed a petition for review of the Court of
Appeals' refusal to grant the writ with the Supreme Court of California,
which was denied in September 1998. The Company intends to continue
vigorously defending the action.

     Quantel Limited, a U.K. corporation, filed and served on the Company in
January 1996 a complaint alleging that the Adobe Photoshop program infringed
five U.S. patents held by Quantel. The complaint was filed in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware. In September 1997, a jury
in federal court in Delaware found in favor of Adobe, finding that Adobe
Photoshop did not infringe the five patents held by Quantel Limited, and that
the five patents are invalid. The judge thereafter entered a decision in
favor of Adobe on the infringement and invalidity issues, but determined that
Quantel had not committed inequitable conduct in dealing with the U.S. Patent
Office. In mid-1998, both parties filed notices of appeal as to various
aspects of the trial court's decision. In August 1998, both parties decided
not to continue their appeals and in September 1998, the court entered an
order accepting the parties' resolution of the case. Neither party has paid
any money in connection with the resolution of the case.

     Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters and 
other matters discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended November 28, 1997, and the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 
10-Q since then, will not have a material impact on the Company's financial 
position or results of operations.

ITEM 2.   CHANGES IN SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

     On September 3, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved certain
amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws related to (i) the
advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals to be brought before
meetings of stockholders, (ii) the requirements for stockholder nominations
of persons for election as directors and (iii) fixing record dates.

       THIS AGREEMENT is made and entered into as of the 13th day of August,
1998, by ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation ("Adobe") who in its
capacity as the sole general partner and sole Class A Limited Partner is
empowered to enter into this amended and restated agreement and who hereby
amends and restates the April 8, 1998 Amended and Restated Limited Partnership
Agreement (the "Prior Agreement") of ADOBE INCENTIVE PARTNERS , L. P. (the
"Partnership"), to reflect changes in the ownership of the Partnership and
related matters, pursuant to the provisions of the California Revised Limited
Partnership Act (the "Act"), as set forth below. This Agreement shall be
effective for Securities acquired by the Partnership on or after August 13,
1998.  The treatment of Securities acquired by the Partnership before August 13,
1998 shall be governed by the Prior Agreement (except that Jack Bell, Ross Bott
and Robert Roblin ceased to be a Limited Partner as of August 11, 1998 and
became entitled to receive the Securities described on Schedule 1 hereto when
such Securities can be distributed under applicable legal and contractual
restrictions; Adobe agreed to repurchase all unvested shares owned by such
parties).
       
                                     ARTICLE 1
                                          
                                CERTAIN DEFINITIONS 
                                          
       1.1    ACCOUNTING PERIOD.  An Accounting Period shall be (i) the Fiscal
Year if there are no changes in the Partners' respective interests in the
Profits or Losses of the Partnership during such period except on the first day
thereof, or (ii) any other period beginning on the first day of the Fiscal Year,
or any other day during the Fiscal Year upon which occurs a change in such
respective interests, and ending on the last day of the Fiscal Year, or on the
day preceding an earlier day upon which any change in such respective interest
shall occur. 
       
       1.2    ADJUSTED ASSET VALUE.  The Adjusted Asset Value with respect to
any asset shall be the asset's adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes,
except as follows: 
       
       (a)    The initial Adjusted Asset Value of any asset contributed
by a Partner to the Partnership shall be the lesser of (i) the gross fair market
value of such asset or (ii) the asset's adjusted basis for federal income tax
purposes at the time of contribution, as determined by the contributing Partner
and the General Partner. 
       
       (b)    In the discretion of the General Partner, the Adjusted Asset
Values of all Partnership assets may be adjusted to equal their respective gross
fair market values, as determined by the General Partner, and the resulting
unrealized profit or loss allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Partners
pursuant to Article 6, as of the following times: (i) the acquisition of an
additional interest in the Partnership by any new or existing Partner in
exchange for more than a DE MINIMIS capital contribution, and (ii) the
distribution by the Partnership to a Partner of more than a DE MINIMIS amount of
Partnership 

                                      1

assets, unless all Partners receive simultaneous distributions of
either undivided interests in the distributed property or identical Partnership
assets in proportion to their interests in Partnership distributions as provided
in paragraphs 8.4 and 8.5. 
   
       (c)    The Adjusted Asset Values of all Partnership assets shall be
adjusted to equal their respective gross fair market values, as determined by
the General Partner, and the resulting unrealized profit or loss allocated to
the Capital Accounts of the Partners pursuant to Article 6, as of the following
times: (i) the termination of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes
pursuant to Code Section 708(b)(l)(B); and (ii) the termination of the
Partnership either by expiration of the Partnership's term or the occurrence of
an event described in paragraph 11.1. 
   
       1.3    AFFILIATE.  An Affiliate of any person shall mean any person that
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is
controlled by or is under common control with, the person specified. 
       
       1.4    CAPITAL ACCOUNT.  The Capital Account of each Partner shall
consist of its original capital contribution (in kind contributions shall be
credited at their Adjusted Asset Value), (i) increased by any additional capital
contributions, its share of income or gain that is allocated to it pursuant to
this Agreement, any Capital Account shift in favor of such Partner, and (ii)
decreased by the amount of any distributions to or withdrawals by it, its share
of expense or loss that is allocated to it pursuant to this Agreement, the
amount of any Capital Account shift away from the Capital Account of such
Partner.  The foregoing provision and the other provisions of this Agreement
relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704 l(b)(2)(iv), and shall, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent
with such Regulations.  In the event the General Partner shall determine that it
is prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or
credits thereto, are computed in order to comply with such Regulations, the
General Partner may make such modification, provided that it is not likely to
have more than an insignificant effect on the total amounts distributable to any
Partner pursuant to Article VIII and Article XI. 
       
       1.5    CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION.  A Partner's Capital Contribution shall mean
the amount that such Partner has contributed to the capital of the Partnership
as set forth opposite such Partner's name on Exhibit A hereto, as from time to
time amended. 
       
       1.6    CODE.  The Code is the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
from time to time (or any corresponding provisions of succeeding law). 
       
       1.7    DEEMED GAIN OR DEEMED LOSS.  The Deemed Gain from any in kind
distribution of Securities shall be equal to the excess, if any, of the fair
market value of the Securities distributed (valued as of the date of
distribution in accordance with paragraph 13.1), over the aggregate Adjusted
Asset Value of the Securities distributed. The Deemed Loss from any in kind
distribution of Securities shall be equal to the excess, if any, of the
aggregate Adjusted Asset Value of the Securities distributed over the fair
market value of the Securities distributed (valued as of the date of
distribution in accordance with paragraph 13.1).

       1.8    EXCLUDED INVESTMENT.  Excluded Investment means a Security of the
Partnership that one or more Partners does not share in because (i) he or she is
an officer, director or five percent or greater shareholder of the issuer of the
Security or (ii) the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors of Adobe
otherwise determines that it is inappropriate for such Partner to participate in
the investment because of the Partner's involvement with the issuer of the
Security. An Excluded Investment shall be designated as such at the time of its
acquisition. 
       
       1.9    MAJORITY IN INTEREST OF THE CLASS A LIMITED PARTNERS.  Majority in
Interest of the Class A Limited Partners means one or more Class A Limited
Partners who own in the aggregate a majority of the Class A Units. 
       
       1.10   MARKETABLE; MARKETABLE SECURITIES; MARKETABILITY.  These terms
shall refer to Securities that are (a) traded on a national securities exchange
or over the counter or (b) currently the subject of an effective Securities Act
registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security shall not be
deemed to be a Marketable Security if, in the good faith judgment of the General
Partner, the market on which such Security trades is not adequate to permit an
orderly sale of all shares of such Security held by the Partnership within a
reasonable time period or if the Securities cannot be sold because of lock-up
restrictions or other contractual restrictions on transfer. 
       
       1.11   NONMARKETABLE SECURITIES.  Nonmarketable Securities are all
Securities other than Marketable Securities. 
       
       1.12   PROFIT OR LOSS.  Profit or Loss shall be an amount computed
separately for each Security for each Accounting Period as of the last day
thereof that is equal to the Partnership's taxable income or loss for each
Security for such Accounting Period, determined in accordance with Section
703(a) of the Code (for this purpose, all items of income, gain, loss, or
deduction required to be stated separately pursuant to Code Section 703(a)(l)
shall be included in taxable income or loss), with the following adjustments: 
       
              (a)    Any income of the Partnership that is exempt from federal
income tax and not otherwise taken into account in computing Profit or Loss
pursuant to this paragraph shall be added to such taxable income or loss; 
   
              (b)    Any expenditures of the Partnership described in Code
Section 705(a)(2)(B) or treated as Code Section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures 
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704 l(b)(2)(iv)(i) and not otherwise
taken into account in computing Profit or Loss pursuant to this paragraph shall
be subtracted from such taxable income or loss; 
   
              (c)    Gain or loss resulting from any disposition of a
Partnership asset with respect to which gain or loss is recognized for federal
income tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the Adjusted Asset Value
of the asset disposed of rather than its adjusted tax basis; 
                
              (d)    The difference between the gross fair market value of all
Partnership assets and their respective Adjusted Asset Values shall be added to
such taxable income or loss in the circumstances described in paragraph 1.2;

              (e)    Items which are specially allocated pursuant to paragraph

account in computing subsequent allocations, so that the net amount of any items
so allocated and the profit, gain, loss, income, expense, and all other items
allocated to each Partner shall, to the extent possible, be equal to the net
amount that would have been allocated to each such Partner if such special
allocations pursuant to this subparagraph (a) had not occurred.

                       INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION AND TRANSFER
                              OF PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS
   
       10.1   INVESTMENT REPRESENTATION OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS.  This Agreement
is made with each Limited Partner in reliance upon the Limited Partner's
representation to the Partnership, which by executing this Agreement the Limited
Partner hereby confirms, that its interest in the Partnership is to be acquired
for investment, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part
thereof, and that it has no present intention of selling, granting participation
in, or otherwise distributing the same, and the Limited Partner understands that
its interest in the Partnership has not been registered under the Securities Act
and that any transfer or other disposition of the interest may not be made
without registration under the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable
exemption therefrom. Each Limited Partner further represents that it does not
have any contract, undertaking, agreement, or arrangement with any person to
sell, transfer, or grant participations to such person, or to any third person,
with respect to its interest in the Partnership. 
   
       10.2   QUALIFICATIONS OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS.  Each Limited Partner
represents that it is an "accredited investor" within the meaning of that term
as defined in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act as set forth

$200,000 in each of the two most recent years or joint income with that person's
spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of those years and who reasonably expects

   The term "net worth" means the excess of total assets over total liabilities.
In computing net worth for the purposes of paragraph 10.2(a) above, the
principal residence of the investor must be valued at cost, including cost of
improvements, or at a recently appraised value by an institutional lender making
a secured loan, net of encumbrances. 
   
       10.3   TRANSFER BY THE GENERAL PARTNER.  The General Partner may not
sell, assign, pledge, mortgage or otherwise dispose of its interest in the
Partnership or in its capital assets or property without the prior written
approval of a Majority in Interest of the Class A Limited Partners. 
       
       10.4   TRANSFER BY A LIMITED PARTNER.  No Limited Partner may sell,
assign, pledge, mortgage, or otherwise dispose of or transfer its interest in
the Partnership without the prior written approval of the General Partner. 
       
       10.5   REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSFER.  No transfer or other disposition of
the interest of a Limited Partner shall be permitted until the General Partner
is reasonably satisfied that the effect of such transfer or disposition would
not: 

                                      14

as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended;
   
              (e)    result in a termination of the Partnership's status as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes; 
   
              (f)    result in a violation of any law, rule, or regulation by a
Limited Partner, the Partnership or the General Partner; or 
   
              (g)    cause the Partnership to be deemed to be a "publicly traded
partnership" as such term is defined in Section 7704(b)of the Code. 
   
       10.6   SUBSTITUTION AS A LIMITED PARTNER. A transferee of a Limited
Partner's interest pursuant to this Article 10 shall become a substituted
Limited Partner only with the consent of the General Partner (which consent may
be withheld by the General Partner for any reason or for no reason) and only if
such transferee (a) elects to become a substituted Limited Partner and (b)
executes, acknowledges and delivers to the Partnership such other instruments as
the General Partner may deem necessary or advisable to effect the admission of
such transferee as a substituted Limited Partner, including, without limitation,
the written acceptance and adoption by such transferee of the provisions of this
Agreement. 
       
       10.7   EXPENSES OF TRANSFER.  Any costs or expenses (including but not
limited to reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Partnership in connection
with the transfer of a Partnership interest hereunder shall be borne by the
transferring Partner.

                   DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP
   
       11.1   EARLY TERMINATION OF THE PARTNERSHIP. 
   
              (a)    The Partnership shall dissolve, and the affairs of the
Partnership shall be wound up prior to the expiration of its term set forth in
paragraph 3.1 upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 
        
                     (i)    One hundred eighty (180) days after the withdrawal,
bankruptcy, or dissolution of the General Partner of the Partnership, unless
within ninety (90) days of such event, a Majority in Interest of the Class A
Limited Partners elect to continue the business of the Partnership and 

                                      15
<PAGE>

to the appointment, effective as of the date of such withdrawal, bankruptcy 
or dissolution, of a new general partner.  In the event that a new general 
partner is elected pursuant to the foregoing sentence, the interest of the 
General Partner shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 11.1(c) 
below; 

                     (ii)   Sale or other transfer of substantially all of the
assets of the Partnership; or 
   
                     (iii)  Mutual consent of the General Partner and a Majority
in Interest of the Class A Limited Partners. 
   
              (b)    In the event that the Partnership is dissolved pursuant to
the provisions of this paragraph, the General Partner (or, if the dissolution
occurs because of an event described in paragraph 11.1(a)(i), a Majority in
Interest of the Class A Limited Partners) shall elect one or more liquidators to
manage the liquidation of the Partnership in the manner described in this
Article 11. 
   
              (c)    If the Limited Partners elect to continue the Partnership
pursuant to its right under paragraph 11.1(a), the former General Partner's
interest in the Partnership shall become a limited partner interest and such
former General Partner shall have no powers of a General Partner under this
Agreement or the Act.  The former General Partner's interest in Short Term
Income shall remain unchanged.  The former General Partner's interest in Profit
and Loss shall be limited to those allocations arising from assets acquired by
the Partnership (i) prior to the date on which the former General Partner ceased
to serve as General Partner (the "Cessation Date") or (ii) by use of the
uninvested portion of the General Partner's capital contributions made prior to
the Cessation Date.  The former General Partner shall have no obligation to make
additional capital contributions pursuant to Article 4 after the Cessation Date.
To the extent reasonably practicable, distributions of amounts allocable to the
former General Partner shall be made in a manner consistent with the foregoing. 
   
       11.2   WINDING UP PROCEDURES. 
   
              (a)    Promptly upon dissolution of the Partnership (unless the
Partnership is continued in accordance with this Agreement or the provisions of
the Act), the affairs of the Partnership shall be wound up and the Partnership
liquidated. The closing Capital Accounts and subaccounts of all the Partners
shall be computed as of the date of dissolution as if the date of dissolution
were the last day of an Accounting Period in accordance with Article 6, and then
adjusted in the following manner: 
   
                     (i)    All assets and liabilities of the Partnership shall
be valued as of the date of dissolution. 
   
                     (ii)   The Partnership's assets as of the date of
dissolution shall be deemed to have been sold at their fair market values and
the resulting Profit or Loss shall be allocated to the Partners' Capital
Accounts in accordance with the provisions of Article 6. 
   
       The result for each Partner shall be its closing Capital Account. 
   
              (b)    Distributions during the winding up period may be made in
cash or in kind or partly in cash and partly in kind.  The General Partner or
the liquidator shall use its best judgment as to the most 

                                      16
<PAGE>

advantageous time for the Partnership to sell Securities or to make 
distributions in kind. All cash and each Security distributed in kind after 
the date of dissolution of the Partnership shall be distributed ratably in 
accordance with the distribution provisions of Article 8. Each Security so 
distributed shall be subject to reasonable conditions and restrictions 
necessary or advisable in order to preserve the value of such Security or for 
legal reasons. 
   
                                     ARTICLE 12
                                          
                               FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING,
                            REPORTS, MEETINGS AND VOTING
   
       12.1   FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING; FISCAL YEAR.  The books and records of the
Partnership shall be kept in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
and otherwise in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied, and shall be reviewed at the end of each fiscal year by an
independent public accountant of recognized national standing selected by the
General Partner. The Partnership's fiscal year shall be a fifty-two/fifty-three
week period ending on the Friday closest to November 30 of each year (the
"Fiscal Year"). 

       12.2   SUPERVISION; INSPECTION OF BOOKS.  Proper and complete books of
account of the Partnership, copies of the Partnership's federal, state and local
tax returns for each fiscal year, the Schedule of Partners set forth in Exhibit
A, this Agreement and the Partnership's Certificate of Limited Partnership shall
be kept under the supervision of the General Partner at the principal office of
the Partnership.  Such books and records shall be open to inspection by the
Limited Partner, or their accredited representatives, at any reasonable time
during normal business hours after reasonable advance notice. 
   
       12.3   PARTNERSHIP REPORTS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE PARTNERSHIP.  The
General Partner shall deliver to the Limited Partners the following: 
   
              (a)    Within 120 days after the close of the Partnership's Fiscal
Year, audited financial statements of the Partnership prepared in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and otherwise in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, including an income statement for the year then
ended and balance sheet as of the end of such year, a statement of changes in
the Partners' Capital Accounts, and a list of investments then held. 
   
              (b)    Within 60 days after the close of each fiscal quarter,
unaudited financial statements. 
   
              (c)    Within 10 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, a
report from the General Partner which shall include a status report on cash
reserves, investments then held, a summary of acquisitions and dispositions of
investments made by the Partnership during the preceding period and a valuation
of each such investment. 
   
       12.4   TAX RETURNS AND TAX INFORMATION.  The Partnership shall use the
method of accounting for tax purposes that is selected by the General Partner
after consultation with the Partnership's independent public accountants.  The
General Partner shall cause the Partnership's federal, state and local 

                                      17
<PAGE>

tax returns and IRS Form 1065, Schedule K 1, to be prepared and delivered to 
the Limited Partners within sixty (60) days after the close of the 
Partnership's fiscal year.  During such period, the General Partner shall 
also cause the Partnership to furnish to any Limited Partner any other tax 
information reasonably requested by such Limited Partner. 
   
       12.5   TAX MATTERS PARTNER.  The General Partner shall be the
Partnership's tax matters partner under the Code and under any comparable
provision of state law.  The General Partner shall have the right to resign as
tax matters partner by giving thirty (30) days' written notice to each Partner. 
Upon such resignation a successor tax matters partner shall be elected by a
Majority In Interest of the Class A Limited Partners.  The tax matters partner
shall employ experienced tax counsel to represent the Partnership in connection
with any audit or investigation of the Partnership by the Internal Revenue
Service and in connection with all subsequent administrative and judicial
proceedings arising out of such audit.  If the tax matters partner is required
by law or regulation to incur fees and expenses in connection with tax matters
not affecting all the Partners, then the Partnership shall be entitled to
reimbursement from those Partners on whose behalf such fees and expenses were
incurred.  The tax matters partner shall keep the Partners informed of all
administrative and judicial proceedings, as required by Section 6223(g)of the
Code, and shall furnish to each Partner, if such Partner so requests in writing,
a copy of each notice or other communication received by the tax matters partner
from the Internal Revenue Service, except such notices or communications as are
sent directly to such requesting Partner by the Internal Revenue Service.  The
relationship of the tax matters partner to the Limited Partners is that of a
fiduciary, and the tax matters partner has fiduciary obligations to perform its
duties as tax matters partner in such manner as will serve the best interests of
the Partnership and all of the Partnership's Partners.  To the fullest extent
permitted by law, but subject to the limitations and exclusions of paragraph
14.4 below, the Partnership agrees to indemnify the tax matters partner and its
agents and save and hold them harmless, from and in respect to all (i) fees,
costs and expenses in connection with or resulting from any laim, action, or
demand against the tax matters partner, the General Partner or the Partnership
that arise out of or in any way relate to the tax matters partner's status as
tax matters partner for the Partnership, and (ii) all such claims, actions, and
demands and any losses or damages therefrom, including amounts paid in
settlement or compromise of any such claim, action, or demand.
   
       12.6   SPECIAL MEETINGS.  Subject to the provisions of the Act, each
Partner may call a special meeting of the Partnership at any reasonable time on
not less than ten (10), nor more than sixty (60), days' written notice.

       13.1   VALUATION.  Subject to the specific standards set forth below, the
valuation of Securities and other assets and liabilities under this Agreement
shall be at fair market value.  Except as may be required under applicable
Treasury Regulations, no value shall be placed on the goodwill or the name of
the Partnership in determining the value of the interest of any Partner or in
any accounting among the Partners. 

                                      18
<PAGE>

              (a)    The following criteria shall be used for determining the
fair market value of Securities: 
              
                     (i)    Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free Marketability: 

                            (1)    If traded on one or more securities exchanges
or the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the Securities'
highest closing price on such exchange(s) on the valuation date. 
   
                            (2)    If actively traded over the counter (other
than on the Nasdaq National Market), the value shall be deemed to be the average
of the closing bid and ask prices of such Securities on the valuation date. 
   
                            (3)    If there is no active public market, the
value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined by the General
Partner, taking into consideration the purchase price of the Securities,
developments concerning the investee company subsequent to the acquisition of
the Securities, any financial data and projections of the investee company
provided to the General Partner; and such other factor or factors as the General
Partner may deem relevant.  If a Majority in Interest of the Class A Limited
Partners objects to the valuation of any Nonmarketable Security within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of the valuation, the fair market value of such Security
shall be determined by an appraiser selected by the senior ranking officer of
the Western Association of Venture Capitalists (or any successor organization)
who is not associated with any of the Partners.  The Partnership shall bear the
expense of any such appraisal. 
       
                     (ii)   Securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free Marketability shall be valued by making an appropriate
adjustment from the value determined under (1), (2), or (3) above to reflect the
effect of the restrictions on transfer. 
       
                     (iii)  The valuation of the Partnership's interest in AVII
shall be based on the valuation of the securities owned by AVII determined in
accordance with AVII's limited partnership agreement. 
       
              (b)    If the General Partner in good faith determines that,
because of special circumstances, the valuation methods set forth in this
paragraph do not fairly determine the value of a Security, the General Partner
shall make such adjustments or use such alternative valuation method as it deems
appropriate.

       14.1   GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
under the laws of the State of California as applied to agreements among the
residents of such state made and to be performed entirely within such state.

       14.2   LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF THE LIMITED PARTNERS. Except as
required by law, no Limited Partner shall be bound by, nor be personally liable
for, the expenses, liabilities, or obligations of the Partnership in excess of
its capital commitment to the Partnership. 
   
       14.3   EXCULPATION. Neither the General Partner, nor its members or
Affiliates shall be liable to any Limited Partner or the Partnership for honest
mistakes of judgment, or for action or inaction, taken in good faith for a
purpose that was reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the
Partnership, or for losses due to such mistakes, action, or inaction, or to the
negligence, dishonesty; or bad faith of any employee, broker, or other agent of
the Partnership, provided that such employee, broker, or agent was selected,
engaged, or retained with reasonable care. The General Partner and such persons
may consult with counsel and accountants in respect of Partnership affairs and
be fully protected and justified in any action or inaction that is taken in
accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel or accountants, provided
that they shall have been selected with reasonable care. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing to the contrary, the provisions of this paragraph and the
immediately following paragraph shall not be construed so as to relieve (or
attempt to relieve) any person of any liability by reason of fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence or to the extent (but only to THE extent) that
such liability may not be waived, modified, or limited under applicable law, but
shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions of such paragraphs to the
fullest extent permitted by law. 
   
       14.4   INDEMNIFICATION. The Partnership agrees to indemnify, out of the
assets of the Partnership only, the General Partner and its members and their
agents (the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent permitted by law and to
save and hold them harmless from and in respect of all (a) reasonable fees,
costs, and expenses, including legal fees, paid in connection with or resulting
from any claim, action, or demand against any Indemnified Party that arises out
of or in any way relate to the Partnership, its properties, business, or affairs
and (b) such claims, actions, and demands and any losses or damages resulting
from such claims, actions, and demands, including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise (if recommended by attorneys for the Partnership) of any such claim,
action or demand; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not extend to
conduct not undertaken in good faith to promote the best interests of the
Partnership or the portfolio companies of the Partnership, nor to any conduct
which constitutes fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence. Expenses
incurred by any Indemnified Party in defending a claim or proceeding covered by
this paragraph shall be paid by the Partnership in advance of the final
disposition of such claim or proceeding provided the indemnified person

                CONFIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE RESIGNATION AGREEMENT
                         AND GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS


   1.   Robert A. Roblin ("Executive") was employed by Adobe Systems 
Incorporated (the "Company") on or about June 28, 1996.  Executive has now 
decided to resign from his employment with the Company.  It is the Company's 
desire to provide Executive with certain benefits that he would not otherwise 
be entitled to receive upon his resignation and to resolve any claims that 
Executive has or may have against the Company.  Accordingly, Executive and 
the Company agree as set forth below.  This Agreement shall become effective 
on the eighth day after it is signed by Executive, but only if Executive has 
not previously revoked his acceptance of this Agreement.
  
   2.   Executive hereby resigns voluntarily from (a) his employment with the 
Company and any of its subsidiaries and (b) any positions that he holds as an 
officer of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries (including, but not 
limited to, his position as an Executive Vice President, Marketing, of the 
Company), with all such resignations effective as of August 11, 1998 (the 
"Resignation Date").

   3.   The Company will provide Executive with the following payments and 
benefits when this Agreement becomes effective: 

      (a)   a lump sum severance payment of $660,000.00, less applicable 
withholding (provided that if such payment and/or any other benefits that 
Executive receives under this Agreement constitute an "excess parachute 
payment" with the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, then 
such payment and/or benefits shall be reduced to the amount that has the 
maximum value to Executive without causing any such payment to be 
nondeductible by the Company under Section 280G); this severance payment will 
be made to Executive within five business days following the date on which 
this Agreement becomes effective; 

      (b)   Executive and his eligible dependents will receive continued 
group health insurance coverage in accordance with federal law (COBRA) at the 
Company's expense for the period starting on the Resignation Date and ending 
on the earlier of (i) October 12, 1999, or (ii) the date on which Executive 
first becomes eligible to obtain other group health insurance coverage 
through another employer; thereafter, Executive and his eligible dependents 
may elect to continue such coverage in accordance with COBRA at their own 
expense; 

      (c)   the Company hereby assigns to Executive all right, title and 
interest in and to that certain IBM Thinkpad 600 personal computer that was 
provided to Executive by Company, and the Company also assigns to Executive 
any Adobe software that is on such computer; by signing this Agreement, 
Executive agrees that his use of such software shall be solely in accordance 
with the terms of the Company's end user license agreements that apply to 
such software, which license agreements are hereby incorporated by reference 
into this Agreement; Executive shall allow the Company to remove all 
non-Adobe software from such computer before Executive takes possession of 
it; and


                                       1
<PAGE>
      (d)   the Company agrees to provide Executive with a mutually agreed 
upon letter of reference in the form attached hereto.

Executive will be (or has been) paid all wages and accrued, unused vacation 
that he earns through the Resignation Date, and he will receive all of his 
vested benefits under the Company's 401(k) and employee stock purchase plans 
in accordance with the terms of those plans.  Executive's rights with respect 
to any equity awards (such as stock options, performance share unit awards 
and restricted units in Adobe Incentive Partners, L.P.) shall be determined 
in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity award plans and/or 
agreements, which are not modified in any way by this Agreement.  Executive 
understands and acknowledges that he shall not be entitled to any payments or 
benefits (including, but not limited to, any bonus for the second half of the 
Company's 1998 fiscal year) from the Company other than those expressly set 
forth in this paragraph 3.  

   4.   Executive and his successors release the Company, its subsidiaries and 
their respective shareholders, investors, directors, officers, employees, 
agents, attorneys, insurers, legal successors and assigns of and from any and 
all claims, actions and causes of action, whether now known or unknown, which 
Executive now has, or at any other time had, or shall or may have against the 
released parties based upon or arising out of any matter, cause, fact, thing, 
act or omission whatsoever occurring or existing at any time up to and 
including the date on which this Agreement becomes effective, including, but 
not limited to, any claims of breach of contract, wrongful termination, 
retaliation, fraud, defamation, infliction of emotional distress or national 
origin, race, age, sex, sexual orientation, disability or other 
discrimination or harassment under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age 
Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, the Americans With Disabilities 
Act, the Fair Employment and Housing Act or any other applicable law.  The 
parties agree that this release of claims shall not affect Executive's right 
to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with the terms of their 
Indemnity Agreement of on or about May 30, 1997.

   5.   Executive acknowledges that he has read section 1542 of the Civil Code 
of the State of California, which states in full:

      A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does 
      not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the
      release, which if known by him must have materially affected his 
      settlement with the debtor.

Executive waives any rights that he has or may have under section 1542 to the 
full extent that he may lawfully waive such rights pertaining to this general 
release of claims, and affirms that he is releasing all known and unknown 
claims that he has or may have against the parties listed above. 

   6.   Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall continue to be bound by 
and comply with the terms of the Employee Inventions and Proprietary Rights 
Assignment Agreement that Executive signed in connection with his employment 
by the Company on or about June 21, 1996.  


                                       2
<PAGE>
   7.   Prior to the Resignation Date, the Company will provide Executive with 
a form of press release announcing the termination of their employment 
relationship.  The Company will consider any reasonable revisions that 
Executive may propose to the press release, but the Company will determine, 
in its sole discretion, whether any such revisions are made to the press 
release.  The press release will be issued by the Company no later than 
August 11, 1998.

   8.   Executive agrees that he shall not:       

      (a)   for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
directly or indirectly disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone 
other than his immediate family or counsel, except as such disclosure may be 
required for accounting or tax reporting purposes or as otherwise may be 
required by law;

      (b)   make any critical or disparaging statements at any time about the 
Company, or any of its products or employees, unless such statements are made 
truthfully in response to a subpoena or other legal process; or

      (c)   make any comments at any time concerning the termination of 
Executive's employment relationship with the Company that are inconsistent 
with the press release described in paragraph 7.

   9.   The Company agrees that it will not, through any of its officers or 
directors:  

      (a)   for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone other than the 
Company's legal counsel and accountants, except as such disclosure may be 
required for tax or securities reporting purposes or by law;

      (b)   make any critical or disparaging statements about Executive at 
any time, unless such statements are made truthfully in response to a 
subpoena or other legal process; or

      (c)   make any comments at any time concerning the termination of 
Executive's employment relationship with the Company that are inconsistent 
with the press release described in paragraph 7.  

   10.   Executive agrees that in the event of his breach of any of the 
provisions of paragraph 8, it will be impractical and extremely difficult to 
determine the actual damages suffered by the Company as a result of that 
breach.  Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any provision of 
paragraph 8, he shall repay the Company 30% of the net sum (that is, after 
deducting all taxes and other withholdings) that he receives pursuant to 
paragraph 3(a) as liquidated damages.  If the Company breaches any of the 
provisions of paragraph 9, then the corresponding provision(s) of paragraph 8 
shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect.  In addition to the 
remedies described above, either party shall be entitled to obtain injunctive 
relief to prevent the other party from committing any breach of its 
respective obligations under Paragraph 8 or 9.


                                       3
<PAGE>
   11.   Following the Resignation Date, Executive agrees to provide 
reasonable assistance to the Company in connection with any litigation to 
which the Company is or may become a party and with respect to which 
Executive possesses any relevant knowledge or expertise.  Executive's 
assistance will be provided at mutually convenient times, and the Company 
will reimburse Executive for any reasonable expenses incurred by him in 
providing such assistance.

   12.   In the event of any legal action relating to or arising out of this 
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing 
party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that action.

   13.   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with 
the laws of the State of California.  To the extent that any provision of 
this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such 
provision shall be deemed stricken from this Agreement, and the remainder of 
this Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect.

   14.   This Agreement, along with any other agreements referenced herein, 
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior negotiations and agreements 
between the parties (including the parties' Retention Agreement of on or 
about September 22, 1997, which is of no further force or effect).  This 
Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a document signed by an 
authorized officer of the Company and Executive.

EXECUTIVE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE SHOULD CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY PRIOR TO 
SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT HE IS GIVING UP ANY LEGAL CLAIMS HE HAS 
AGAINST THE PARTIES RELEASED ABOVE BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT.  EXECUTIVE 
FURTHER UNDERSTANDS THAT HE MAY HAVE UP TO 45 DAYS TO CONSIDER THIS 
AGREEMENT, THAT HE MAY REVOKE IT AT ANY TIME DURING THE 7 DAYS AFTER HE SIGNS 
IT, AND THAT IT SHALL NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL THAT 7-DAY PERIOD HAS 
PASSED.  EXECUTIVE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE IS SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT KNOWINGLY, 
WILLINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY IN EXCHANGE FOR THE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS 
DESCRIBED IN PARAGRAPH 3.

                                AND GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS


   1.   Ross A. Bott ("Executive") was employed by Adobe Systems Incorporated 
(the "Company") on or about December 26, 1996.  Executive and the Company 
have now agreed to terminate his employment relationship with the Company.  
It is the Company's desire to provide Executive with certain benefits that he 
would not otherwise be entitled to receive upon his termination and to 
resolve any claims that Executive has or may have against the Company.  
Accordingly, Executive and the Company agree as set forth below.  This 
Agreement shall become effective on the eighth day after it is signed by 
Executive, but only if Executive has not previously revoked his acceptance of 
this Agreement.
  
   2.   Executive hereby resigns voluntarily from any positions that he holds 
as an officer of the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries (including, but 
not limited to, his position as Executive Vice President, Product Divisions), 
with all such resignations effective as of August 11, 1998 (the "Resignation 
Date").  Executive and the Company agree that his employment with the Company 
and any of its subsidiaries will terminate effective as of October 19, 1998 
(the "Termination Date").  During the period between the Resignation Date and 
the Termination Date:  (a) Executive will provide transition assistance as 
requested by the Company, and will take paid time off in accordance with the 
Company's paid time off policies; and (b) the Company will continue to 
provide Executive with the same base salary and employee benefits that he was 
receiving immediately prior to the Resignation Date.

   3.   The Company will provide Executive with the following payments and 
benefits when this Agreement becomes effective: 

      (a)   a lump sum severance payment of $800,000.00, less applicable 
withholding (provided that if such payment and/or any other benefits that 
Executive receives under this Agreement constitute an "excess parachute 
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, 
then such payment and/or benefits shall be reduced to the amount that has the 
maximum value to Executive without causing any such payment to be 
nondeductible by the Company under Section 280G); this severance payment will 
be made to Executive on the eighth day following his re-execution of this 
Agreement as described in paragraph 4 below; 

      (b)   Executive and his eligible dependents will receive continued 
group health insurance coverage in accordance with federal law (COBRA) at the 
Company's expense for the period starting on the Resignation Date and ending 
on the earlier of (i) November 19, 1999, or (ii) the date on which Executive 
first becomes eligible to obtain other group health insurance coverage 
through another employer; 

      (c)   as soon as practicable following the Termination Date, the 
Company will amend Executive's Company stock option grants so as to allow 
Executive to exercise his right to purchase any stock options that have 
become vested as of the Termination Date at any time up to and including 
June 15, 1999; except as modified by this subparagraph (c), Executive's 
rights with 


                                       1
<PAGE>
respect to any stock options granted to him by the Company shall continue to 
be determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable stock option 
plans and/or agreements;

      (d)   the Company hereby assigns to Executive all right, title and 
interest in and to the laptop computer and desktop computer that were 
provided to Executive by the Company, and the Company also assigns to 
Executive any Adobe software that is on such computers; by signing this 
Agreement, Executive agrees that his use of such software shall be solely in 
accordance with the terms of the Company's end user license agreements that 
apply to such software, which license agreements are hereby incorporated by 
reference into this Agreement; Executive shall allow the Company to remove 
all non-Adobe software from such computers before Executive takes possession 
of them; 

      (e)   the Company agrees to provide Executive with a mutually agreed 
upon letter of reference; and

      (f)   the Company agrees that it will not contest any claim for 
unemployment benefits that may be filed by Executive after the Termination 
Date.

Executive will be paid all wages and accrued, unused vacation that he earns 
through the Termination Date, and he will receive all of his vested benefits 
under the Company's 401(k) and employee stock purchase plans in accordance 
with the terms of those plans.  Executive will be reimbursed by the Company 
for any reasonable business expenses incurred by Executive in the course of 
his employment with the Company, pursuant to the Company's applicable 
business expense reimbursement policies (except that the Company shall not 
deny the reimbursement of any such expenses under those policies on the 
ground that they were not timely submitted by Executive).  Executive's rights 
with respect to any equity awards (such as stock options, performance share 
unit awards and restricted units in Adobe Incentive Partners, L.P.) shall be 
determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity award plans 
and/or agreements, which are not modified in any way by this Agreement 
(except as set forth in subparagraph (c)).  Executive understands and 
acknowledges that he shall not be entitled to any payments or benefits 
(including, but not limited to, any bonus for the second half of the 
Company's 1998 fiscal year) from the Company other than those expressly set 
forth in this paragraph 3.  

   4.   Executive and his successors release the Company, its subsidiaries and 
their respective shareholders, investors, directors, officers, employees, 
agents, attorneys, insurers, legal successors and assigns of and from any and 
all claims, actions and causes of action, whether now known or unknown, which 
Executive now has, or at any other time had, or shall or may have against the 
released parties based upon or arising out of any matter, cause, fact, thing, 
act or omission whatsoever occurring or existing at any time up to and 
including the Termination Date, including, but not limited to, any claims of 
breach of contract, wrongful termination, retaliation, fraud, defamation, 
infliction of emotional distress or national origin, race, age, sex, sexual 
orientation, disability or other discrimination or harassment under the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, the 
Americans With Disabilities Act, the Fair Employment and Housing Act or any 
other applicable law.  As additional consideration for the severance payment 
described in paragraph 3(a), Executive agrees that he will reaffirm this 
release

of claims by re-signing this Agreement in the space provided at the end of 
the Agreement on or after the Termination Date.  The parties agree that the 
releases of claims contained in this Agreement shall not affect Executive's 
right to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with the terms of their 
Indemnity Agreement of on or about May 30, 1997.

   5.   Executive acknowledges that he has read section 1542 of the Civil Code 
of the State of California, which states in full:

      A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not 
know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, 
which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the 
debtor.

Executive waives any rights that he has or may have under section 1542 to the 
full extent that he may lawfully waive such rights pertaining to this general 
release of claims, and affirms that he is releasing all known and unknown 
claims that he has or may have against the parties listed above. 

   6.   Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall continue to be bound by 
and comply with the terms of the Employee Inventions and Proprietary Rights 
Assignment Agreement that Executive signed in connection with his employment 
by the Company.  

   7.   Prior to the Resignation Date, the Company will provide Executive with 
a form of press release announcing the termination of their employment 
relationship.  The Company will consider any reasonable revisions that 
Executive may propose to the press release, but the Company will determine, 
in its sole discretion, whether any such revisions are made to the press 
release.  The press release will be issued by the Company no later than 
August 11, 1998.

   8.   Executive agrees that he shall not: 

       (a)   for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
directly or indirectly disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone 
other than his immediate family, his counsel, his financial advisors, or the 
Employment Development Department, except as such disclosure may be required 
for accounting or tax reporting purposes or as otherwise may be required by 
law;

      (b)   make any critical or disparaging statements at any time about the 
Company, or any of its products or employees, unless such statements are made 
truthfully in response to a subpoena or other legal process; or

      (c)   make any comments at any time concerning the termination of 
Executive's employment relationship with the Company that are inconsistent 
with the press release described in paragraph 7.

   9.   The Company agrees that it will not, through any of its officers or 
directors:

<PAGE>
      (a)   for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone other than the 
Company's legal counsel and accountants, except as such disclosure may be 
required for tax or securities reporting purposes or by law;

      (b)   make any critical or disparaging statements about Executive at 
any time, unless such statements are made truthfully in response to a 
subpoena or other legal process; or

      (c)   make any comments at any time concerning the termination of 
Executive's employment relationship with the Company that are inconsistent 
with the press release described in paragraph 7.  

   10.   Executive agrees that in the event of his breach of any of the 
provisions of paragraph 8, it will be impractical and extremely difficult to 
determine the actual damages suffered by the Company as a result of that 
breach.  Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any provision of 
paragraph 8, he shall repay the Company 30% of the net sum (that is, after 
deducting all taxes and other withholdings) that he receives pursuant to 
paragraph 3(a) as liquidated damages.  If the Company breaches any of the 
provisions of paragraph 9, then the corresponding provision(s) of paragraph 8 
shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect.

   11.   Following the Termination Date, Executive agrees to provide 
reasonable assistance to the Company in connection with any litigation to 
which the Company is or may become a party and with respect to which 
Executive possesses any relevant knowledge or expertise.  Executive's 
assistance will be provided at mutually convenient times, and the Company 
will reimburse Executive for any reasonable expenses incurred by him in 
providing such assistance.

   12.   In the event of any legal action relating to or arising out of this 
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing 
party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that action.    

   13.   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with 
the laws of the State of California.  To the extent that any provision of 
this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such 
provision shall be deemed stricken from this Agreement, and the remainder of 
this Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect.

   14.   This Agreement, along with any other agreements referenced herein, 
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the 
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior negotiations and agreements 
between the parties (including the parties' Retention Agreement of on or 
about September 12, 1997, which is of no further force or effect).  This 
Agreement may not be modified or amended except by a document signed by an 
authorized officer of the Company and Executive.

EXECUTIVE UNDERSTANDS THAT HE SHOULD CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY PRIOR TO 
SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT HE IS GIVING UP ANY LEGAL CLAIMS HE HAS 
AGAINST THE PARTIES RELEASED ABOVE BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT.  EXECUTIVE 
FURTHER UNDERSTANDS THAT HE MAY HAVE UP TO 45

               CONFIDENTIAL EXECUTIVE RESIGNATION AGREEMENT
                       AND GENERAL RELEASE OF CLAIMS


   1.   P. Jackson Bell ("Executive") was employed by Adobe Systems 
Incorporated (the "Company") on or about November 11, 1996.  Executive has 
now decided to resign from his employment with the Company.  It is the 
Company's desire to provide Executive with certain benefits that he would not 
otherwise be entitled to receive upon his resignation and to resolve any 
claims that Executive has or may have against the Company.  Accordingly, 
Executive and the Company agree as set forth below.  This Agreement shall 
become effective on the eighth day after it is signed by Executive, but only 
if Executive has not previously revoked his acceptance of this Agreement.
  
   2.   Executive hereby resigns from (a) his employment with the Company and 
any of its subsidiaries, and (b) any positions that he holds as an officer of 
the Company and/or any of its subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, 
his positions as Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary of the Company), with all 
such resignations effective as of August 11, 1998 (the "Resignation Date").

   3.   The Company will provide Executive with the following payments and 
benefits when this Agreement becomes effective: 

      (a)   a lump sum severance payment of $750,000.00, less applicable 
withholding (provided that if such payment and/or any other benefits that 
Executive receives under this Agreement constitute an "excess parachute 
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, 
then such payment and/or benefits shall be reduced to the amount that has the 
maximum value to Executive without causing any such payment to be 
nondeductible by the Company under Section 280G); this severance payment will 
be made to Executive within five business days following the date on which 
this Agreement becomes effective; and

      (b)   Executive and his eligible dependents will receive continued 
group health insurance coverage in accordance with federal law (COBRA) at the 
Company's expense for the period starting on the Resignation Date and ending 
on the earlier of (i) February 11, 2000, or (ii) the date on which Executive 
first becomes eligible to obtain other group health insurance coverage 
through another employer.  

Executive will be (or has been) paid all wages and accrued, unused vacation 
that he earns through the Resignation Date, and he will receive all of his 
vested benefits under the Company's 401(k) and employee stock purchase plans 
in accordance with the terms of those plans.  Executive's rights with respect 
to any equity awards (such as stock options, performance share unit awards 
and restricted units in Adobe Incentive Partners, L.P.) shall be determined 
in accordance with the terms of the applicable equity award plans and/or 
agreements, which are not modified in any way by this Agreement.  Executive 
understands and acknowledges that he shall not be entitled to any payments or 
benefits (including, but not limited to, any bonus for the second half of the 
Company's 1998 fiscal year) from the Company other than those expressly set 
forth in this paragraph 3.  


                                       1

   4.   Executive and his successors release the Company, its subsidiaries and 
their respective shareholders, investors, directors, officers, employees, 
agents, attorneys, insurers, legal successors and assigns of and from any and 
all claims, actions and causes of action, whether now known or unknown, which 
Executive now has, or at any other time had, or shall or may have against the 
released parties based upon or arising out of any matter, cause, fact, thing, 
act or omission whatsoever occurring or existing at any time up to and 
including the date on which this Agreement becomes effective, including, but 
not limited to, any claims of breach of contract, wrongful termination, 
retaliation, fraud, defamation, infliction of emotional distress or national 
origin, race, age, sex, sexual orientation, disability or other 
discrimination or harassment under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age 
Discrimination In Employment Act of 1967, the Americans With Disabilities 
Act, the Fair Employment and Housing Act or any other applicable law.  The 
parties agree that this release of claims shall not affect Executive's right 
to be indemnified by the Company in accordance with the terms of their 
Indemnity Agreement of May 30, 1997.

   5.   Executive acknowledges that he has read section 1542 of the Civil Code 
of the State of California, which states in full:

      A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not 
      know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the 
      release, which if known by him must have materially affected his 
      settlement with the debtor.

Executive waives any rights that he has or may have under section 1542 to the 
full extent that he may lawfully waive such rights pertaining to this general 
release of claims, and affirms that he is releasing all known and unknown 
claims that he has or may have against the parties listed above. 

   6.   Executive acknowledges and agrees that he shall continue to be bound by 
and comply with the terms of the Employee Inventions and Proprietary Rights 
Assignment Agreement that Executive signed in connection with his employment 
by the Company.  

   7.   Prior to the Resignation Date, the Company will provide Executive with 
a form of press release announcing the termination of their employment 
relationship.  The Company will consider any reasonable revisions that 
Executive may propose to the press release, but the Company will determine, 
in its sole discretion, whether any such revisions are made to the press 
release.  The press release will be issued by the Company no later than 
August 11, 1998.

   8.   Executive agrees that he shall not:       

      (a)   for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
directly or indirectly disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone 
other than his immediate family or counsel, except as such disclosure may be 
required for accounting or tax reporting purposes or as otherwise may be 
required by law;


                                       2
<PAGE>
      (b)   make any critical or disparaging statements at any time about the 
Company, or any of its products or employees, unless such statements are made 
truthfully in response to a subpoena or other legal process; or

      (c)   make any comments at any time concerning the termination of 
Executive's employment relationship with the Company that are inconsistent 
with the press release described in paragraph 7.

   9.   The Company agrees that it will not, through any of its officers or 
directors:  

      (a)   for a period of six months following the Resignation Date, 
disclose any of the terms of this Agreement to anyone other than the 
Company's legal counsel and accountants, except as such disclosure may be 
required for tax or securities reporting purposes or by law;

      (b)   make any critical or disparaging statements about Executive at 
any time, unless such statements are made truthfully in response to a 
subpoena or other legal process; or

      (c)   make any comments at any time concerning the termination of 
Executive's employment relationship with the Company that are inconsistent 
with the press release described in paragraph 7.  

   10.   Executive agrees that in the event of his breach of any of the 
provisions of paragraph 8, it will be impractical and extremely difficult to 
determine the actual damages suffered by the Company as a result of that 
breach.  Accordingly, Executive agrees that if he breaches any provision of 
paragraph 8, he shall repay the Company 30% of the net sum (that is, after 
deducting all taxes and other withholdings) that he receives pursuant to 
paragraph 3(a) as liquidated damages.  If the Company breaches any of the 
provisions of paragraph 9, then the corresponding provision(s) of paragraph 8 
shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect.

   11.   Following the Resignation Date, Executive agrees to provide 
reasonable assistance to the Company in connection with any litigation to 
which the Company is or may become a party and with respect to which 
Executive possesses any relevant knowledge or expertise.  Executive's 
assistance will be provided at mutually convenient times, and the Company 
will reimburse Executive for any reasonable expenses incurred by him in 
providing such assistance.

   12.   In the event of any legal action relating to or arising out of this 
Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the losing 
party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in that action.

   13.   This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with 
the laws of the State of California.  To the extent that any provision of 
this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such 
provision shall be deemed stricken from this Agreement, and the remainder of 
this Agreement shall continue to be in full force and effect.
