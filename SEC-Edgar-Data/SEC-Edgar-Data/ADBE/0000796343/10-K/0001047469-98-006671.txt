                                     PART I
 
ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
                               BUSINESS OVERVIEW
 
    Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe" or the "Company") develops, markets, and
supports computer software products and technologies that enable users to
express and use information across all print and electronic media. The Company
offers a market-leading line of application software and type products for
creating and distributing visually rich communication materials; licenses its
industry-standard technologies to major hardware manufacturers, software
developers, and service providers; and offers integrated software solutions to
businesses of all sizes. The Company's software runs on Microsoft Windows, Apple
Macintosh, and UNIX platforms.
 
    The Company was originally incorporated in California in October 1983 and
was reincorporated in Delaware in May 1997. The Company maintains its executive
offices and principal facilities at 345 Park Avenue, San Jose, California
95110-2704. Its telephone number is 408-536-6000. The Company also maintains a
World Wide Web site at HTTP://WWW.ADOBE.COM.
 
                                    PRODUCTS
 
    In 1984, Adobe developed the software that initiated desktop publishing.
Today, Adobe is uniquely positioned to make a further dramatic impact not only
on how society creates visually rich information, but also on how it distributes
and accesses that information electronically.
 
    While other major software companies' products deal in raw words, data, and
numbers, Adobe software helps people use the computer to express and share their
ideas in imaginative and meaningful new ways, whether the choice of media is
static or dynamic, paper or electronic. In the simplest terms, Adobe products
enable people to create, send, view, and print high-impact information, helping
them and their ideas stand out.
 
    Adobe software enables users to work with professional creative tools;
assemble illustrations, images, and text into fully formatted documents; output
documents directly to any kind of printing device; and distribute documents on
paper, video, or compact disc, over the Internet, an e-mail system, or corporate
network. Moreover, Adobe software enables users to perform all of these tasks
across multiple computing environments, including Microsoft Windows, Apple
Macintosh, and UNIX.

<PAGE>
        Adobe PostScript Extreme--the innovative new production printing
    architecture that integrates Adobe PostScript and the Portable Document
    Format ("PDF"). This architecture has been endorsed by the printing industry
    as the new standard for high-performance print-on-demand, direct-to-press,
    and high-resolution imagesetter printing systems.
 
                                  COMPETITION
 
    The markets for Adobe products are characterized by intense competition,
evolving industry standards, rapid technology developments, and frequent new
product introductions. Adobe's future success will depend on its ability to
enhance its existing products, introduce new products on a timely and
cost-effective basis, meet changing customer needs, extend its core technology
into new applications, and anticipate or respond to emerging standards and other
technological changes.
 
GRAPHICS PRODUCTS
 
    Within its Graphics Products area, Adobe markets six product families that
fall into two major groupings: professional publishing (Adobe Photoshop, Adobe
PageMaker, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Type Library) and dynamic media (Adobe
Premiere and Adobe After Effects). In these groupings, the individual products
compete favorably on the basis of features and functions, installed base, ease
of use, product reliability, and price and performance characteristics. In
addition, the products increasingly work well together, providing broader
functionality and minimizing product learning issues for the individual who uses
multiple applications to complete a project.
 
    A number of companies currently offer one or more products that compete
directly or indirectly with one or more of Adobe's graphics products. These
companies include Quark, Macromedia, Corel, MetaCreations, Avid and Linotype.
 
    With the advent of the World Wide Web, the needs of the graphics
professional are rapidly changing to encompass on-line publishing as well as
print-based publishing. These changing customer needs have created new
opportunities for Adobe's graphics products, drive the Company's product
development cycles, and introduce new potential competitors.
 
ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS
 
    In the authoring and publishing market, the Company's Adobe FrameMaker
product faces competition from large-scale electronic publishing systems
developed by several companies, including Interleaf. Participants in this market
compete based on the quality and features of their products, the level of
customization and integration with other publishing system components, the
number of hardware platforms supported, service, and price. The Company believes
it can successfully compete in this market based upon the quality and features
of the Adobe FrameMaker product, its extensive application programming
interface, the large number of platforms supported, and other factors.
 
    In the document transmission and archive area, the Company's Adobe Acrobat
family faces competition from entrenched office applications and internet
content creation tools that use HTML. The Company feels it competes favorably in
terms of the combined benefits of compression, visual fidelity, transmittal time
and security of documents expressed using Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format
(PDF). Competitors include Microsoft and Corel.
 
HOME & OFFICE PRODUCTS
 
    The consumer software market is characterized by intense competition, price
sensitivity, brand awareness, and strength in retail distribution. Adobe faces
direct and indirect competition in these markets from a number of companies,
including Microsoft and Broderbund. The Company believes it competes favorably
with its Adobe PhotoDeluxe product due to its strong relationships with critical
original
 
                                       5
<PAGE>
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and market influencers and its ability to
leverage core competencies from established products.
 
    The Internet market is a constantly evolving and highly volatile market,
characterized by rapid technology developments and frequent new product
introductions. Adobe PageMill faces significant competition from companies
offering similar products and will continue to face competition from emerging
technologies and products. Some of these competitors include Macromedia,
Microsoft, and NetObjects.
 
PRINTING SYSTEMS PRODUCTS
 
    Adobe believes that the principal competitive factors for OEMs in selecting
a page description language or a printing technology are product capabilities,
market leadership, reliability, support, engineering development assistance, and
price. The Company believes that its competitive advantages include its
technology competency, OEM relationships, and intellectual property portfolio.
Adobe PostScript and Adobe PrintGear software face competition from
Hewlett-Packard's proprietary PCL page description language, and from developers
of page description languages based on the PostScript language standard,
including Xionics and Harlequin.
 
                                   OPERATIONS
 
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
 
    Adobe markets and distributes its products directly and through multiple
channels, including distributors, retailers, systems integrators, software
developers, and value-added resellers ("VARs"), as well as through OEM and
hardware bundle customers. Adobe supports its worldwide distribution network and
end-user customers through international subsidiaries. Adobe Systems Europe Ltd.
is headquartered in Edinburgh, Scotland, with subsidiaries in France, Germany,
Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.
Adobe's Pacific Rim presence includes Adobe Systems Company Ltd. in Japan as
well as operations in Asia, Pacific, and Latin America, including Australia,
Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, India, and Mexico. The Company also has operations
in Canada. More than 6,000 resellers in the United States and Canada and more
than 300 distributors throughout Europe, Japan, and Asia, Pacific, and Latin
America offer Adobe software applications and type products.
 
    Adobe licenses its Adobe PostScript software and other printing systems
technology to computer and printer manufacturers, who in turn distribute their
products worldwide. The Company derives a significant portion of Adobe
PostScript royalties from international sales of printers, imagesetters, and
other output devices by its OEM customers.
 
MANUFACTURING
 
    Manufacturing operations include duplication of disks, assembly of purchased
parts, and final packaging for retail products. Adobe contracts a majority of
its manufacturing activities to third parties, both in the United States and in
Europe.
 
    Disk duplication for European language versions of the Company's products is
managed through the European headquarters. The master disks of European-language
versions of products are forwarded to McQueen Holdings Limited ("McQueen") which
duplicates the disks, prints, and assembles the components and ships the
completed product. Quality control tests are performed on all duplicate disks
and finished products.
 
    At November 28, 1997, the Company held a 13% equity interest in McQueen.
Effective December 31, 1997, McQueen was acquired by Sykes Enterprises, Inc.
("Sykes") and the Company exchanged its shares of McQueen for shares of Sykes
common stock. The Company expects to maintain its business relationship
 
                                       6
<PAGE>
with McQueen and that McQueen will continue to provide services to the Company
for the foreseeable future.
 
    To date, Adobe has not experienced significant difficulties in obtaining raw
materials for the manufacture of its products or in the duplication of disks,
printing, and assembly of components, although an interruption in production by
a supplier could result in a delay in shipment of Adobe's products. There was no
material backlog of orders as of December 26, 1997.
 
CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND EDUCATION
 
    For Adobe's application software, a technical support and services staff
responds to customer queries by phone and on-line. The Company also informs
customers through its ADOBE MAGAZINE and a growing series of how-to books
published by Adobe Press, a joint venture with Macmillan Computer Publishing. In
addition, Adobe prepares and authorizes independent trainers to teach Adobe
software classes in person or increasingly via computer-based and internet-based
training programs, sponsors workshops led by its own graphics staff, interacts
with independent user groups, and conducts regular seeding and testing programs.
 
INVESTMENT IN NEW MARKETS
 
    The Company has invested in two venture capital limited partnerships that
are chartered to invest in innovative companies strategic to Adobe's software
business. Adobe Ventures L.P. and Adobe Ventures II L.P. enable the Company to
join other investors in making new products and services available to computer
users and in building new market opportunities. Adobe has thus invested in new
markets, and intends to continue investing in new markets, both through the
limited partnerships as well as by direct investments by the Company.
 
    The Company owns a minority interest in certain companies and a majority
interest in Adobe Ventures L.P. and Adobe Ventures II L.P. Investments in
publicly traded equity securities that are free of trading restrictions, or will
become free of trading restrictions within one year, are carried at fair value
based on quoted market prices. Investments in equity securities that are not
publicly traded, or are restricted from trading for more than one year, are
carried at the lower of cost or market.
 
    The investments in Adobe Ventures L.P. and Adobe Ventures II L.P. are
accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and, accordingly, the
investments are adjusted to reflect the Company's share of Adobe Ventures L.P.
and Adobe Ventures II L.P.'s investment income (loss) and dividend
distributions. Adobe Ventures L.P. and Adobe Ventures II L.P. carry their
investments in equity securities at an estimated fair market value and
unrealized gains and losses are included in investment income (loss).
Substantially all of the technology companies held by the limited partnerships
at November 28, 1997 are not publicly traded, and, therefore, there is no
established market for these investments. As such, these investments are valued
based on the most recent round of financing involving new non-strategic
investors and estimates made by the general partner, a third party. When
investments held by the limited partnerships are publicly traded, the fair value
of such investments is based on quoted market prices, and mark-to-market
adjustments are included in investment income. In general, as a matter of policy
of the limited partnerships, the investments in the technology companies held by
the limited partnerships will be distributed to the partners prior to the
investee company's initial public offering.
 
    In March 1997, as part of its venture investing program, the Company
established an internal limited partnership, Adobe Incentive Partners L.P.
("AIP"), which allows certain of the Company's executive officers to participate
in cash or stock distributions from Adobe's venture investments. Assets held by
AIP include Adobe's entire interests in Adobe Ventures L.P. and Adobe Ventures
II L.P. and equity securities of privately-held companies. Adobe is both the
general partner and a limited partner. Other limited partners are executive
officers of the Company who are involved in Adobe's venture investing activities
and whose participation is deemed critical to the success of the program.
 
                                       7
<PAGE>
    Adobe's Class A senior limited partnership interest includes both a
liquidation preference and a preference in recovery of the cost basis of each
specific investment. The executives' Class B junior limited partnership interest
qualifies for partnership distributions only after: (a) Adobe has fully
recovered the cost basis of its investment in the specific investee company for
which a distribution is made; and (b) the participating executive has vested in
his or her distribution rights. The distribution rights generally vest on a
monthly basis over three years, such that the rights are 25% vested after one
year, 50% vested after two years and fully vested at the end of three years. The
limited partnership investments are restricted to investments in companies that
are private at the time of the establishment of AIP or when the investment is
made, whichever is later. Partnership interests may be allocated to designated
officers only while the investee company is still private. Class B interests may
not exceed a maximum of 20% of the venture investments included in AIP. No
distributions were made to the participating officers in fiscal 1997 and expense
related to AIP in fiscal 1997 was immaterial. At November 28, 1997, the minority
interest held by the participating officers was immaterial and is included in
accrued expenses on the balance sheet.
 
    The Company's portfolio of equity investments including those held by AIP at
November 28, 1997, had a cost basis of $56.1 million and was valued at $46.9

                              PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
 
    Since the personal computer software industry is characterized by rapid
technological change, a continuous high level of expenditures is required for
the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products. Adobe
primarily develops its software internally. The Company sometimes acquires
products developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business
entity that held ownership rights to the technology. In other instances, Adobe
has licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs
developed by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may
obligate the Company to pay royalties, typically based on a percentage of the
revenues generated by those programs.
 
    During the years ended November 28, 1997, November 29, 1996, and December 1,
1995, the Company's research and development expenses, including costs related
to contract development, were $170.9 million, $152.9 million, and $138.6
million, respectively. During each of the years 1997, 1996, and 1995, the
Company acquired through purchase transactions one or more software companies.
In each of these transactions, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to
in-process research and development and expensed at the time of the acquisition.
In 1997, 1996, and 1995, $6.0 million, $21.3 million, and $15.0 million was
expensed, respectively.
 
                               PRODUCT PROTECTION
 
    Adobe regards its software as proprietary and protects it with copyrights,
patents, trademarks, trade secret laws, internal and external nondisclosure
precautions, and restrictions on disclosure and transferability that are
incorporated into its software license agreements. The Company protects the
source code of its software programs as trade secrets, and makes source code
available to OEM customers only under limited circumstances and specific
security and confidentiality constraints.
 
    The Company's products are generally licensed to end users on a "right to
use" basis pursuant to a license that is nontransferable and restricts the use
of the products to the customer's internal purposes on a designated number of
printers or computers. The Company also relies on copyright laws and on "shrink
wrap" and electronic licenses that are not signed by the end user. Copyright
protection may be unavailable under the laws of certain countries. The
enforceability of "shrink wrap" and electronic licenses has not been
conclusively determined. Adobe has obtained many patents and has registered
numerous trademarks and logos in the United States and foreign countries.
 
    Policing unauthorized use of computer software is difficult, and software
piracy is a persistent problem for the software industry. This problem is
particularly acute in international markets. Adobe conducts vigorous anti-piracy
programs. Adobe products do not contain copy protection, except on copies for
international distribution in certain countries. Many products, including Adobe
PageMaker, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator, incorporate network
copy-detection features. These capabilities help encourage compliance with the
Company's license agreements by alerting customers about certain concurrent
usage problems over a given network.
 
    Adobe believes that, because computer software technology changes and
develops rapidly, patent, trade secret, and copyright protection are less
significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability, and experience of its
personnel, name recognition, contractual relationships, and ongoing product
development.
 
                                   EMPLOYEES
 
    As of December 26, 1997, Adobe employed 2,702 people, none of whom are
represented by a labor union. The Company has not experienced work stoppages and
believes its employee relations are good. Competition in recruiting personnel in
the software industry is intense. Adobe believes its future success will depend
in part on its continued ability to recruit and retain highly skilled
management, marketing, and technical personnel.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
    Quantel Limited, a U.K. corporation, filed and served on the Company in
January 1996 a complaint alleging that the Adobe Photoshop program infringed
five U.S. patents held by Quantel. The complaint was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware. On September 19, 1997, a jury in
federal court in Delaware found in favor of Adobe, finding that Adobe Photoshop
did not infringe the five patents held by Quantel Limited, and that the five
patents are invalid. Quantel has filed post-trial motions requesting a new
trial. Adobe is vigorously opposing the motions.
 
    On February 6, 1996, a securities class action complaint was filed against
Adobe, certain of its officers and directors, certain former officers of Adobe
and Frame Technology Corporation ("Frame"), Hambrecht & Quist, LLP ("H&Q"),
investment banker for Frame, and certain H&Q employees, in connection with the
drop in the price of Adobe stock following its announcement of financial results
for the quarter ended December 1, 1995. The complaint was filed in the Superior
Court of the State of California, County of Santa Clara. The complaint alleges
that the defendants misrepresented material adverse information regarding Adobe
and Frame and engaged in a scheme to defraud investors. The complaint seeks
unspecified damages for alleged violations of California law. Adobe believes
that the allegations against it and its officers and directors are without merit
and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit. The case is currently in the
discovery phase.
 
    On April 17, 1997, a derivative action was filed in the Superior Court of
the State of California, County of Santa Clara, against the current members of
Adobe's Board of Directors and Paul Brainerd, a former member of the Board. The
suit was filed by a stockholder purporting to assert on behalf of the Company
claims for alleged breach of the Directors' fiduciary duty and mismanagement
related to the Company's acquisition of Frame in October 1995. The Court granted
Adobe's motion for dismissal of the suit, with leave to amend for the plaintiff.
In January 1998, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint making substantially
the same claims.
 
    Management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of
operations.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS
 
    The Company's common stock is traded on The Nasdaq National Stock Market
under the symbol "ADBE." On December 26, 1997, there were 2,084 holders of
record of the Company's common stock. Because many of such shares are held by
brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, the Company is unable
to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record
holders. The following table sets forth the high and low sales price per share
of the Company's common stock, and the cash dividends paid per share, for the
periods indicated.

    The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock each quarter since
the second quarter of 1988. In March 1997, the Company established the venture
stock dividend program under which the Company may, from time to time,
distribute as a dividend-in-kind shares of its equity holdings in investee
companies to Adobe stockholders. In 1997, the Company dividended one share of
Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") common stock for each 100
shares of Adobe common stock held by stockholders of record on July 31, 1997. An
equivalent cash dividend was paid for holdings of less than 2,500 Adobe shares
and for fractional Netscape shares. Also, on December 1, 1997, the Company
dividended one share of Siebel Systems, Incorporated ("Siebel") common stock for
each 300 shares of Adobe common stock held by stockholders of record on October
31, 1997. An equivalent cash dividend was paid for holdings of less than 7,500
Adobe shares and for fractional Siebel shares. The declaration of future
dividends, whether in cash or in-kind, is within the discretion of the Board of
Directors of the Company and will depend upon business conditions, the Company's
results of operations, the financial condition of the Company, and other
factors.

OVERVIEW
 
    Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe" or the "Company") develops, markets, and
supports computer software products and technologies that enable users to
express and use information across all print and electronic media. The Company
licenses its technology to major computer, printing, and publishing suppliers,
and markets a line of application software products and type products for
authoring and editing visually rich documents. The Company distributes its
products through a network of original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") customers,
distributors and dealers, and value-added resellers ("VARs") and systems
integrators. The Company has operations in North America, Europe, Japan, and
Asia, Pacific, and Latin America.
 
    In January 1996, the Company divested its prepress applications product
business to a newly established company, Luminous Corporation ("Luminous").
Under the terms of the agreement, Luminous continued to develop, market, and
distribute Adobe's prepress application products, and Adobe maintained ownership
of certain core technologies for Adobe prepress products. Revenue from the
prepress application business unit was approximately $10.4 million in fiscal
year 1995. In October 1996, the Company sold its remaining interest in Luminous
for approximately $6.8 million, which was recorded as a realized gain.

    Revenue growth in 1997 is attributable primarily to increased application
products shipments resulting from the release of new and enhanced products. In
1996, revenue grew due to increases in both licensing activity related to the
Company's PostScript interpreter and application products. Product unit volume
(as opposed to price) growth was the principal factor in the Company's revenue
growth in application products revenue in both 1997 and 1996. No customer
accounted for more than 10% of the Company's total revenue in 1997, 1996, or
1995.

    Licensing revenue is derived from shipments by OEM customers of products
containing the Adobe PostScript interpreter, Adobe PrintGear software, and the
Display PostScript system. Such Adobe PostScript products include: (1) standard
roman printers as well as printers that work with Japanese, Chinese, and Korean
languages; (2) imagesetters; and (3) workstations. Licensing revenue is also
derived from shipments of products containing the Configurable PostScript
Interpreter ("CPSI") by OEM customers. CPSI is a fully functional Adobe
PostScript interpreter that resides on the host computer system rather than in a
dedicated controller integrated into an output device. The configuration
flexibility of CPSI allows OEMs and software developers to create and market a
variety of Adobe PostScript products independently of controller hardware
development. Adobe PostScript products sell to the small office/home office
("SOHO") market, as well as the corporate enterprise and high-end imagesetter
markets. Adobe PrintGear software is targeted to the SOHO and home computer
market.
 
    Royalty per unit is generally calculated as a percentage of the end user
list price of a printer, although some components of licensing revenue based on
a flat dollar amount per unit typically do not change with list prices.
Licensing revenue in 1997 was unchanged from 1996 licensing revenue. Increased
demand for CPSI, color capability, and Adobe PrintGear products was offset by a
number of factors affecting OEMs, primarily in the Japanese and Macintosh
markets. These factors included, but were not limited to, continuing weakness in
Macintosh-related printer sales and in Japanese personal computer and printer
markets, as well as a slow pace of new Adobe PostScript 3 and Adobe PrintGear
products being brought to market by OEMs.
 
    The Company has seen year-to-year increases in the number of OEM customers
from which it is receiving licensing revenue and believes that such increases
are attributable to the continued acceptance of Adobe PostScript software, as
well as the diversification of the Company's customer base across multiple
platforms. During 1997, a number of OEM customers introduced new Adobe PrintGear
products that serve the SOHO market. Late in 1997, some OEM customers began to
transition from Adobe PostScript Level 2 products to Adobe PostScript 3
products. This transition is expected to continue through 1998. Also in the fall
of 1997, one of Adobe's largest PostScript customers, Hewlett-Packard Company
("HP"), introduced a non-Adobe clone version of PostScript in one family of
monochrome laser printers. The Company continues to be cautious about licensing
revenue in the short term because of the factors identified in the previous
paragraph and the anticipated loss of revenue from monochrome laser printer
products from HP.

</TABLE>
 
    Application products revenue is derived from shipments of application
software programs marketed primarily through retail and distribution channels;
however, Adobe PageMill, Adobe SiteMill, Adobe FrameMaker, and Adobe Acrobat
products are becoming more widely distributed through VARs and systems
integrators. Adobe PhotoDeluxe is primarily distributed through OEM bundling
agreements with digital camera, scanner, and personal computer manufacturers.
 
    Application products revenue growth in 1997 was primarily due to increased
demand for Adobe Photoshop, the Adobe Acrobat family of products, Adobe
PhotoDeluxe, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe PageMaker. A new version of Adobe
Photoshop was released in late fiscal 1996, and new versions of Adobe PageMaker
and Adobe Illustrator were released in the first and second quarters of fiscal
1997, respectively. In addition, during the second half of 1997, a new version
of Adobe FrameMaker across multiple platforms and in multiple languages, the
Windows version of Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0, and various other products in
localized international versions were released. The 1996 revenue growth in this
area resulted from increased demand for Adobe Photoshop, Adobe PageMill, Adobe
SiteMill, Adobe Illustrator, and the Adobe Acrobat family of products, as well
as demand for new products. The increase was partially offset by decreased
demand for Adobe FrameMaker and Adobe PageMaker products. The
 
                                       18
<PAGE>
Company released Adobe Photoshop 4.0 for both the Macintosh and Windows
platforms, and Adobe Acrobat 3.0 near the end of the fourth quarter of 1996. In
addition, Adobe PageMill and Adobe SiteMill, which were both released in late
1995, added revenue in 1996.
 
    Overall, revenue from the Company's application products on the Windows
platform increased by 64% in 1997 over 1996, while application products revenue
from the Macintosh platform increased 1%. In 1997, the Windows and Macintosh
platforms accounted for 50.6% and 49.4%, respectively, of application products
revenue, excluding platform-independent and UNIX products, compared to 38.6% and
61.4%, respectively, in 1996. The Company expects this trend toward the Windows
platform to continue for the foreseeable future.
 
    At the end of 1997, the Company experienced a decline in revenue from the
Japanese market, due to reductions in sell-through rates by the Company's
Japanese distributors and corresponding higher inventory levels. The Company
remains cautious about the economic conditions in Japan as well as the
fluctuating economic conditions in other Asian countries in the short term.

</TABLE>
 
    Direct costs include direct product, packaging, and shipping costs, as well
as royalties, localization costs, and amortization of acquired technologies.
 
    Gross margin (expressed as a percentage of revenue), in general, is affected
by the mix of licensing revenue versus application products revenue, as well as
the product mix within application products. Direct costs for application
products decreased during 1997 as the Company transitioned from distribution of
its products on disk to distribution on CD-ROM media, which has a lower cost per
unit. In addition, certain acquired technologies became fully amortized during
1997, and localization costs were lower in 1997 than in 1996. Localization costs
will vary from year-to-year depending on the timing of the release of new
versions of products. Direct costs were slightly higher in 1996 compared to 1995
as a percentage of revenue due to higher localization costs. Also, there was a
general decline in 1996 in Adobe FrameMaker revenue and associated gross
margins.
 
    Gross margin in 1998 is expected to be approximately the same as in 1997 as
the cost savings from the continued shift to CD-ROM media is offset by higher
localization costs.

</TABLE>
 
    Research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and
benefits for software developers, contracted development efforts, related
facilities costs, and expenses associated with computer equipment used in
software development.
 
    Research and development expense has increased over the last three years as
the Company has invested in new technologies, new product development, and the
infrastructure to support such activities. The increase reflects the expansion
of the Company's engineering staff and related costs required to support these
efforts. The Company continues to make significant investments in the
development of its
 
                                       19
<PAGE>
Adobe PostScript and application software products, including those targeted for
the growing Internet market.
 
    The Company believes that investments in research and development are
necessary to remain competitive in the marketplace and are directly related to
continued timely development of new and enhanced products. Accordingly, the
Company intends to continue recruiting and hiring experienced software
developers. While the Company expects that research and development expenditures
in 1998 will increase in absolute dollars, such expenditures are expected to
remain approximately the same as a percentage of revenue.

</TABLE>
 
    During 1997, software development expenditures on all products, after
reaching technological feasibility, were immaterial and therefore were expensed
as incurred. Certain software development expenditures on products developed by
Frame Technology Corporation ("Frame") and Aldus Corporation ("Aldus") prior to
their acquisition by Adobe were capitalized and were amortized over the lives of
the respective products. Amortization of capitalized software development costs
decreased in 1997 and 1996 as a result of achieving full amortization of all
Frame products by the end of 1996 and all Aldus products by the end of 1995.
 
    The Company expects that software development expenditures on all products,
after achieving technological feasibility, will continue to be immaterial in the
future and therefore will be expensed as incurred.

</TABLE>
 
    Sales, marketing, and customer support expenses generally include salaries
and benefits, sales commissions, travel expenses, and related facility costs for
the Company's sales, marketing, customer support, and distribution personnel.
Sales, marketing, and customer support expenses also include the costs of
programs aimed at increasing revenue, such as advertising, trade shows, and
other market development programs.
 
    Increases in sales, marketing, and customer support expenses in both 1997
and 1996 are due to increased advertising and promotional expenditures for
upgrades of existing products and further development of customer and technical
support services to support a growing installed base of customers. In addition,
a portion of the 1997 increase relates to new product releases, increased
investment in the Windows market, and programs related to furthering worldwide
recognition of the Adobe brand.
 
    For fiscal 1998, sales, marketing, and customer support expenditures are
expected to increase in absolute dollars and may increase as a percentage of
revenue.

</TABLE>
 
    General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and
benefits, travel expenses, and related facility costs for the finance, human
resources, legal, information services, and executive and administrative
personnel of the Company. General and administrative expenses also include
outside legal
 
                                       20
<PAGE>
and accounting fees, provision for bad debts, and expenses associated with
computer equipment and software used in the administration of the business.
 
    General and administrative expenses increased from 1997 compared to 1996 due
to higher information system costs, legal costs, and employee costs primarily
associated with a more comprehensive administrative infrastructure. The 1996
increase over 1995 resulted primarily from Frame integration costs in the first
quarter of 1996 and a higher headcount entering fiscal 1996. In addition, the
increase was driven by salary increases as well as higher systems and legal
costs in 1996.
 
    The Company expects general and administrative spending in 1998 to be
slightly higher than 1997 levels in absolute dollars as the Company continues to
invest in an expanded and more comprehensive executive and administrative
infrastructure.

    During 1997, 1996, and 1995, the Company acquired seven software companies,
in separate transactions, and accounted for them using the purchase method. In
each of these transactions, a portion of the purchase price was allocated to
in-process research and development and was expensed at the time of the
acquisitions.

    Merger transaction and restructuring costs for 1996 were $5.0 million. This
represents charges of $5.7 million less the reversal of $0.7 million of excess
reserves related to restructuring costs recorded in prior years. The 1996
charges were recorded in connection with the disposition of two business units
previously owned by Frame.
 
    During the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company recorded merger transaction
and restructuring costs primarily associated with the acquisition of Frame of
$32.5 million and reversed approximately $1.0 million of excess restructuring
reserves related to the acquisition of Aldus in 1994 as well as the remaining
accrued restructuring costs related to a 1993 restructuring implemented by
Frame.
 
    At November 28, 1997, the remaining accrued restructuring balance of $8.4
million, included in other accrued expenses on the balance sheet, related to
lease and third-party contract termination payments, resulting from the planned
closure of duplicate offices in Europe and the United States. These payments are
expected to continue through the lease terms or negotiated early termination
date, if applicable.

    Investment gain (loss) consists principally of realized gains or losses from
direct investments as well as mark-to-market valuation adjustments for Adobe
Ventures L.P. investments.
 
    In 1997, the investment gain relates primarily to the Company's liquidation
of its investment in Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") through
the distribution to its stockholders of 554,660 shares of Netscape as a
dividend-in-kind and the sale of its remaining Netscape shares. The 1996 gain
arose primarily as a result of realized gains of approximately $43.6 million and
approximately $6.8 million for the sale of a portion of the Company's investment
in Netscape and its entire investment in Luminous Corporation, respectively.
Also, a portion of one of the equity investments included in the Adobe Ventures
L.P. portfolio was sold for a gain of $13.9 million during 1996 and at November
29, 1996, the remaining portion of this investment was marked-to-market for an
unrealized gain of approximately $3.7 million. These and other gains were
partially offset by write-downs on certain other investments.

</TABLE>
 
    Interest and other income consists principally of interest earned on cash,
cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as foreign exchange
transaction gains and losses.
 
    The increase in interest and other income in 1997 from 1996 is primarily due
to higher interest income in 1997 on higher average cash balances. The slight
decrease in 1996 from 1995 is primarily due to foreign exchange gains in 1995
compared to foreign exchange losses in 1996.

</TABLE>
 
    The Company's effective tax rate decreased in 1997 from 1996 primarily due
to lower nondeductible charges for the write-off of acquired in-process research
and development and higher tax-exempt income. The 1996 tax rate decreased
significantly from 1995 primarily as a result of lower nondeductible charges,
including merger costs, goodwill, and the write-off of acquired in-process
research and development. An analysis of the differences between the statutory
and effective income tax rates is provided in Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
    The Company expects that the effective tax rate for fiscal 1998 will be
between 37% and 38% due to lower tax-exempt interest income as a result of cash
requirements for the Company's stock repurchase programs.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
    The Company believes that in the future its results of operations could be
affected by various factors, such as delays in shipment of the Company's new
products and major new versions of existing products,
 
                                       23
<PAGE>
market acceptance of new products and upgrades, continuing weakness in demand
for Macintosh application software and Macintosh-related printers, renegotiation
of royalty arrangements, growth in worldwide personal computer and printer sales
and sales price adjustments, consolidation in the OEM printer business, industry
transitions to new business and information delivery models, ongoing weakness in
the Japanese and other Asian economies, and adverse changes in general economic
conditions in any of the countries in which the Company does business.
 
    The Company's ability to develop and market products, including upgrades of
current products that successfully adapt to changing customer needs, may also
have an impact on the results of operations. The Company's ability to extend its
core technologies into new applications and to anticipate or respond to
technological changes could affect its ability to develop these products. A
portion of the Company's future revenue will come from these products. Delays in
product introductions could have an adverse effect on the Company's revenue,
earnings, or stock price. The Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that
these new products or upgrades will have on its revenue or results of
operations.
 
    Although the Company generally offers its application products on Macintosh,
Windows, and UNIX platforms, a majority of the overall revenue from these
products prior to 1997 has been for the Macintosh platform, particularly for the
higher end Macintosh computers. In 1997, Windows-based application revenue
exceeded that for the Macintosh platform for the first time. If there is a
continuing slowdown of customer purchases in the higher end Macintosh market, or
if the Company is unable to increase its sales to Windows customers, the
Company's operating results could be materially adversely affected. Also, if the
Company broadens its customer base to achieve greater penetration in the
corporate business and consumer markets, the Company may need to adapt its
application software distribution channels. The Company could experience
decreases in average selling prices and some transitions in its distribution
channel which could materially adversely affect its operating results. In
addition, to the extent that there is a slowdown of customer purchases of
personal computers in general, the Company's operating results could be
materially adversely affected.
 
    The Company's OEM customers on occasion seek to renegotiate their royalty
arrangements. The Company evaluates these requests on a case-by-case basis. If
an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to pursue other options,
which could result in lower licensing revenue for the Company. In the fall of
1997, HP began to ship non-Adobe clone software in some HP LaserJet printers,
resulting in somewhat lower licensing revenue to the Company, although the
impact was minimal. The Company expects a more significant impact on its 1998
licensing revenue, although it continues to work with HP printer operations to
incorporate Adobe PostScript and other technologies in other HP products.
 
    During late 1997, the Company experienced a decline in both application and
licensing revenue from the Japanese market, due to a weak Japanese computer
market and general economic conditions in Japan. In addition, at the end of
fiscal 1997, inventory levels for application products at the Company's Japanese
distributors remained higher than what the Company considers normal. The Company
expects these adverse economic conditions to continue in the short term, and
they may adversely affect the Company's revenue and earnings. Although there are
also adverse conditions in other Asian economies, the countries affected
represent a much smaller portion of the Company's revenue and thus have less
impact on the Company's operational results.
 
    Through its acquisitions, the Company has experienced significant growth.
The Company's ability to effectively manage its growth will require it to
continue to improve its operational and financial controls and information
management systems, and to attract, retain, motivate, and manage employees
effectively. The failure of the Company to effectively manage growth and
transition in multiple areas of its business could have a material adverse
effect on its results of operations.
 
    The Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an
increasing number of market entrants that have introduced or developed products
addressing authoring and communications over the Internet. As is typical in the
case of a new and evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for
 
                                       24
<PAGE>
recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of
uncertainty. The software industry addressing the authoring for and
communications over the Internet is young and has few proven products. In
addition, new models for licensing software will be needed to accommodate new
information delivery practices. Moreover, critical issues concerning the
commercial use of the Internet (including security, reliability, ease of use and
access, cost, and quality of service) remain unresolved and may affect the
growth of Internet use, together with the software standards and electronic
media employed in such markets.
 
    The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue and operating
income from its subsidiaries located in Europe, Japan, and Asia, Pacific, and
Latin America. The Company generally experiences lower revenue from its European
operations in the third quarter because many customers reduce their business
activities in the summer months. While most of the revenue of the European
subsidiaries is denominated in U.S. dollars, the majority of revenue derived
from Japan is denominated in yen and the majority of all subsidiaries' operating
expenses are denominated in their local currencies. As a result, the Company's
operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates. To date, the accounting impact of such fluctuations has been
insignificant. The Company's hedging policy attempts to mitigate some of these
risks, based on management's best judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among
risk, opportunity, and expense. The Company has established a hedging program as
described below in "Derivatives and Financial Instruments." The program is used
to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily
of the Japanese yen. The Company's hedging program is not comprehensive, and
there can be no assurance that the program will offset more than a portion of
the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign
currency exchange rates.
 
    Due to the factors noted above, the Company's future earnings and stock
price may be subject to significant volatility, particularly on a quarterly
basis. Any shortfall in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities
analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading
price of the Company's common stock in any given period. Additionally, the
Company may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the fiscal quarter, which
could result in an even more immediate and adverse effect on the trading price
of the Company's common stock. Finally, the Company participates in a highly
dynamic industry. In addition to factors specific to the Company, changes in
analysts' earnings estimates for the Company or its industry and factors
affecting the corporate environment or the securities markets in general will
often result in significant volatility of the Company's common stock price.
 
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 128, "Earnings Per
Share." SFAS No. 128 establishes a different method of computing net income per
share than is currently required under the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 15. Under SFAS No. 128, the Company will be required to
present both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share. Basic
net income per share is expected to be higher than the currently presented net
income per share, as the effect of dilutive stock options will not be considered
in computing basic net income per share. Diluted net income per share is
expected to be comparable to the currently presented net income per share.
 
    The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 128 in its fiscal quarter ending
February 27, 1998, and at that time, all historical net income per share data
presented will be restated to conform to the provisions of SFAS No. 128.
 
    In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. It does
not, however, require a specific format for the disclosure, but requires the
Company to display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the
period in its financial statements. The Company will be required to implement
SFAS No. 130 for its fiscal year 1999.
 
    Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes standards
for the manner in which public companies
 
                                       25
<PAGE>
report information about operating segments in annual and interim financial
statements. The Company is currently evaluating the operating segment
information that it will be required to report. The Company will be required to
implement SFAS No. 131 for its fiscal year 1999.
 
    In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." SOP
97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of
software revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997 and will require the Company to modify
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not expect
the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
results of operations.
 
"YEAR 2000" ISSUES
 
    The Company is aware of the issues associated with the programming code in
existing computer systems as the year 2000 approaches. The "Year 2000" problem
is pervasive and complex, as many computer systems will be affected in some way
by the rollover of the two-digit year value to 00. Systems that do not properly
recognize such information could generate erroneous data or cause a system to
fail. The "Year 2000" issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen
problems in its own computer systems and from third parties with whom the
Company deals on financial transactions worldwide. Failures of the Company's
and/or third parties' computer systems could have a material impact on the
Company's ability to conduct its business.
 
    The Company's financial information systems include an SAP system recently
implemented in the United States and Japan and an Oracle system in Europe that
will be upgraded to the most recent version in the first quarter of fiscal 1998.
These systems are believed to be "Year 2000" compliant. The Company is analyzing
its remaining computer systems to identify any potential "Year 2000" issues and
will take appropriate corrective action based on the results of such analysis.
Management has not yet determined the cost related to achieving "Year 2000"
compliance.
 
    In addition, the "Year 2000" issue could affect the products that the
Company sells. The Company believes that the current versions of its products
are "Year 2000" compliant. The Company's products are subject to ongoing
analysis and review.

</TABLE>
 
    The Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased
in 1997 from 1996 primarily as a result of cash expended for the Company's stock
repurchase program. These expenditures were partially offset by cash generated
from operations.
 
    Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid money market instruments. All of
the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting
principally of municipal bonds, auction rate certificate securities, United
States government and government agency securities, and asset-backed securities,
are classified as available-for-sale under the provisions of SFAS No. 115. The
securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses, net
of tax, reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

    Included above is stockholders' equity, and at November 29, 1996, deferred
income taxes of $3.8 million related to unrealized gains and losses on equity
investments, and obligations for put warrants of $71.3 million. The Company has
no long-term debt. Stockholders' equity as of November 28, 1997 was $715.4
million, compared to $706.5 million as of November 29, 1996 and $698.4 million
as of December 1, 1995. The year-to-year increases in stockholders' equity
include issuances of common stock under the Company's stock option and employee
stock purchase plans and, in 1997, the reclassification of the put warrant
obligation back to stockholders' equity. In 1997 and 1996, the increase in
stockholders' equity was substantially offset by the repurchase of stock.
 
    In September 1997, the Board of Directors authorized, subject to certain
business and market conditions, the purchase of up to 15,000,000 shares of the
Company's stock over the next two years. Under this program, as well as under
previously authorized programs, the Company repurchased 6,150,656 shares and
3,321,500 shares in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company may continue to
directly repurchase common shares and arrange options to purchase common shares,
depending on market conditions and the Company's cash requirements.
 
    The Company has paid cash dividends on its common stock each quarter since
the second quarter of 1988. During 1997, the Company paid cash dividends of
$0.20 per common share. In addition, during 1997, the Company distributed its
holdings in Netscape Communications Corporation and Siebel Systems, Inc. to the
Company's stockholders as a dividend-in-kind. The declaration of future
dividends, whether in cash or in-kind, is within the discretion of the Company's
Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, the Company's
results of operations and financial condition, and other factors.

Working capital.........................  $   454.3         (10)% $   506.1      --       $   506.5
</TABLE>
 
    The decrease in working capital in fiscal 1997 from 1996 is primarily due to
lower cash and short-term investment balances as a result of the Company's stock
repurchase program. Cash flow provided by operations during fiscal 1997 was
$208.6 million compared to $198.1 million in fiscal 1996.
 
    Expenditures for property and equipment in 1997 totaled $33.9 million. Such
expenditures are expected to continue, including expenditures for computer
systems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support, and
administrative staff. In the future, additional cash may be used to acquire
software products or technologies complementary to the Company's business. Net
cash used by financing activities during 1997 was $219.2 million, or $117.7
million greater than in fiscal 1996, primarily resulting from the repurchase of
common stock and payment of cash dividends partially offset by issuance of
common stock under employee stock plans.
 
    The Company believes that existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term
investments, together with cash generated from operations, will provide
sufficient funds for the Company to meet its operating cash requirements in the
foreseeable future.
 
DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
  (ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK)
 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING INSTRUMENTS
 
    The Company transacts business in various foreign currencies, primarily in
certain European countries and Japan. Accordingly, the Company is subject to
exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. This
exposure is primarily related to yen denominated sales in Japan and local
currency denominated operating expenses in Europe, where the Company sells
primarily in U.S. dollars.
 
                                       27
<PAGE>
    The Company's Japanese operating expenses are in yen, which mitigates the
exposure related to yen denominated sales in Japan. In addition, the Company
hedges firmly committed transactions using primarily forward contracts with
maturities of less than three months. At November 28, 1997, the Company held
$1.9 million of aggregate foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the
sale of Japanese yen, all of which expire at various times through February 25,
1998. The unrealized gains and losses associated with these contracts are not
material.
 
    The Company's accounting policies for these instruments are based on the
Company's designation of such instruments as hedging transactions. Gains and
losses associated with the mark-to-market of outstanding foreign exchange
forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of existing
transactions, for which a firm commitment has been attained, are recognized in
income in the current period. Corresponding gains and losses on the foreign
currency denominated transactions being hedged are recognized in income in that
same period. In this manner, the gains and losses on foreign currency
denominated transactions will be offset by the gains and losses on the foreign
currency contracts. The Company does not anticipate any material adverse effect
on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as
a result of these instruments.
 
    The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
trading purposes, nor does the Company hedge its foreign currency exposure in a
manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
 
    The Company currently does not use financial instruments to hedge local
currency denominated operating expenses in Europe. Instead, the Company believes
that a natural hedge exists, in that local currency revenue from product
upgrades substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating
expenses. The Company assesses the need to utilize financial instruments to
hedge European currency exposure on an ongoing basis.
 
    The Company regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this
review determine at any time to change its hedging program.
 
    FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS
 
    At November 28, 1997, the Company had an investment portfolio of fixed
income securities, including those classified as cash equivalents, of $523.9
million. These securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations. An increase
in interest rates could affect the market value of the Company's fixed income
securities.
 
    A sensitivity analysis was performed on the Company's investment portfolio
as of November 28, 1997. This sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling
technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result
from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus 50, plus 100, or plus 150 basis
points over a 12-month time horizon. The market value changes for a 50, 100, or
150 basis point increase in short-term treasury security yields were not
material due to the limited duration of the Company's portfolio.
 
    The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment
portfolio to manage interest rate risk. The Company does, however, limit its
exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly
monitoring clear policies and guidelines for its fixed income portfolios. At the
present time, the maximum duration of all portfolios is limited to 2.3 years.
The guidelines also establish credit quality standards, limits on exposure to
one issue, issuer, as well as the type of instrument. Due to the limited
duration and credit risk criteria established in the Company's guidelines, the
exposure to market and credit risk is not expected to be material.
 
    PUT WARRANTS AND CALL OPTIONS
 
    To facilitate the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company sold put
warrants in a series of private placements in 1997 and 1996. Each warrant
entitled the holder to sell one share of Adobe's
 
                                       28
<PAGE>
common stock to the Company at a specified price. Approximately 4.6 million and
4.5 million put warrants were written in 1997 and 1996, respectively. At
November 28, 1997, approximately 2.9 million put warrants were outstanding that
expire on various dates through May 1998 that have exercise prices ranging from
$37.07 to $47.98 per share, with an average exercise price of $43.09 per share.
In addition, in 1997 and 1996, the Company purchased call options from an
independent third party that entitled the Company to buy 2.3 million and 4.5
million shares, respectively, of its common stock. At November 28, 1997,
approximately 0.5 million call options were outstanding that expire on various
dates through April 1998 and have exercise prices ranging from $37.32 to $46.86
per share, with an average exercise price of $41.32 per share. Under these
arrangements, the Company, at its option, can settle with physical delivery or
net shares equal to the difference between the exercise price and the market
value at the date of exercise.
 
COMMITMENTS
 
    The Company's principal commitments as of November 28, 1997 consisted of
obligations under operating leases, a real estate development agreement, and
various service agreements with a related party.
 
    During 1994, the Company entered into a real estate development agreement
and an operating lease agreement in connection with the construction of an
office facility. In August 1996, the construction was completed and the
operating lease commenced. The Company will have the option to purchase the
facility at the end of the lease term, in October 2001. In the event the Company
chooses not to exercise this option, the Company is obligated to arrange for the
sale of the facility to an unrelated party and is required to pay the lessor any
difference between the net sales proceeds and the lessor's net investment in the
facility, in an amount not to exceed that which would preclude classification of
the lease as an operating lease, approximately $57.3 million. During the
construction period, the Company was required to pledge certain interest-bearing
instruments to the lessor as collateral to secure the performance of its
obligations under the lease. As of November 28, 1997, the Company's deposits
under this agreement totaled approximately $66.7 million in United States
government treasury notes and money market mutual funds. These deposits are
included in "Other assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    In 1996, the Company exercised its option under the development agreement to
begin a second phase of development for an additional office facility. In August
1996, the Company entered into a construction agreement and an operating lease
agreement for this facility. The operating lease will commence on completion of
construction in 1998. The Company will have the option to purchase the facility
at the end of the lease term (five years after occupancy). In the event the
Company chooses not to exercise this option, the Company is obligated to arrange
for the sale of the facility to an unrelated party and is required to pay the
lessor any difference between the net sales proceeds and the lessor's net
investment in the facility, in an amount not to exceed that which would preclude
classification of the lease as an operating lease, approximately $64.3 million.
The Company also is required, periodically during the construction period, to
deposit funds with the lessor as an interest-bearing security deposit to secure
the performance of its obligations under the lease. During 1997, the Company
deposited approximately $33.0 million and as of November 28, 1997, the Company's
deposits under this agreement totaled approximately $36.3 million. These
deposits are included in "Other assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    At November 28, 1997, the Company held a 13% equity interest in McQueen
International Limited ("McQueen") and accounted for the investment using the
cost method. During 1994, the Company entered into various agreements with
McQueen, whereby the Company contracted with McQueen to perform product
localization and technical support functions and to provide printing, assembly,
and warehousing services. Effective December 31, 1997, McQueen was acquired by
Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated ("Sykes"), a publicly traded company. In
connection with the acquisition, the Company exchanged its shares of McQueen for
486,676 shares of Sykes' restricted common stock and will record a gain on the
exchange of $6.7 million in fiscal 1998. The Company's equity interest in Sykes
is less than 2%. The Company expects that McQueen will continue to provide
services to the Company for the foreseeable future.

                              MANAGEMENT'S REPORT
 
    Management is responsible for all the information and representations
contained in the consolidated financial statements and other sections of this
FORM 10-K. Management believes that the consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
appropriate in the circumstances to reflect in all material respects the
substance of events and transactions that should be included, and that the other
information in this FORM 10-K is consistent with those statements. In preparing
the consolidated financial statements, management makes informed judgments and
estimates of the expected effects of events and transactions that are currently
being accounted for.
 
    In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the consolidated
financial statements, management depends on the Company's system of internal
accounting controls. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded and transactions are executed in accordance with
management's authorization, and are recorded properly to permit the preparation
of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. In designing control procedures, management recognizes
that errors or irregularities may nevertheless occur. Also, estimates and
judgments are required to assess and balance the relative cost and expected
benefits of the controls. Management believes that the Company's accounting
controls provide reasonable assurance that errors or irregularities that could
be material to the consolidated financial statements are prevented or would be
detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions.
 
    The Board of Directors pursues its oversight role for these consolidated
financial statements through the Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of
Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company. The Audit Committee
meets with management periodically to review their work and to monitor the
discharge of each of their responsibilities. The Audit Committee also meets
periodically with KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, the independent auditors, who have free
access to the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, without management
present, to discuss internal accounting control, auditing, and financial
reporting matters.
 
    KPMG Peat Marwick LLP is engaged to express an opinion on our consolidated
financial statements. Their opinion is based on procedures believed by them to
be sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial
statements are not materially misleading and do not contain material errors.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Adobe Systems Incorporated:
 
    We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Adobe
Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as listed in the accompanying index. In
connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also
have audited the accompanying financial statement schedule. These consolidated
financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.
 
    We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
    In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Adobe
Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of November 28, 1997 and November 29,
1996, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended November 28, 1997, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
    OPERATIONS
 
    Founded in 1982, Adobe Systems Incorporated ("Adobe" or the "Company")
develops, markets, and supports computer software products and technologies that
enable users to express and use information across all print and electronic
media. The Company licenses its technology to major computer, printing, and
publishing suppliers, and markets a line of application software products and
type products for authoring and editing visually rich documents. Additionally,
the Company markets a line of powerful, easy-to-use products for home and small
business users. The Company distributes its products through a network of
original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") customers, distributors and dealers, and
value-added resellers ("VARs") and systems integrators. The Company has
operations in North America, Europe, Japan, and Asia, Pacific, and Latin
America.
 
    FISCAL YEAR
 
    The Company's fiscal year is a 52/53 week year ending on the Friday closest
to November 30.
 
    BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
 
    The accompanying consolidated financial statements include those of Adobe
and its subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany accounts
and transactions.
 
    RECAPITALIZATION
 
    In May 1997, the Company was reincorporated in the State of Delaware. As
part of this reincorporation, each outstanding share of the predecessor
California Corporation preferred stock and common stock was converted
automatically to one share of the new Delaware Corporation $0.0001 par value
preferred stock and common stock. All prior periods presented have been restated
to reflect this change.
 
    USE OF ESTIMATES
 
    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements,
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
    CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
 
    Cash equivalents consist of instruments with maturities of three months or
less at the time of purchase.
 
    All of the Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments, and
certain noncurrent investments in equity securities, free of trading
restrictions or to become free of trading restrictions within one year, are
classified as "available-for-sale." These investments are carried at fair value,
based on quoted market prices, and unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,
are reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Realized gains and
losses upon sale or maturity of these investments are determined using the
specific identification method.

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
 
    Assets and liabilities of certain foreign subsidiaries, whose functional
currency is the local currency, are translated at year-end exchange rates.
Income and expense items are translated at the average rates of exchange
prevailing during the year. The adjustment resulting from translating the
financial statements of such foreign subsidiaries is reflected as a separate
component of stockholders' equity. Certain other transaction gains or losses,
which have not been material, are reported in results of operations.
 
    PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
 
    Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization
are calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives (thirty-five years for the building; two to seven years for
furniture and equipment) or lease terms (five to nine years for leasehold
improvements) of the respective assets.
 
    OTHER ASSETS
 
    Purchased technology, goodwill, and certain other intangible assets are
stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is provided on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets,
generally three to seven years. Capitalization of computer software development
costs, when material, begins upon the establishment of technological
feasibility. Such costs are amortized using the greater of the ratio of current
product revenue to the total current and anticipated product revenue or the
straight-line method over the software's estimated economic life, generally 9 to
36 months. The Company periodically reviews the net realizable value of its
intangible assets and adjusts the carrying amount accordingly.
 
    The Company owns a minority interest in certain technology companies. Such
investments are accounted for under the cost method, as the Company does not
have significant influence or control over the investee companies. The Company
owns a majority interest in two limited partnerships that were established to
invest in technology companies. The limited partnership investments are
accounted for under the equity method because contractually the partnerships are
controlled by the general partner, a third party.
 
    LONG-LIVED ASSETS
 
    The Company reviews property and equipment for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not
be recoverable. Recoverability of property and equipment is measured by
comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows the property and
equipment are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the
carrying amount of the property and equipment exceeds its fair market value, as
determined by discounted cash flows. The Company assesses the recoverability of
enterprise-level goodwill by determining whether the unamortized goodwill
balance can be recovered through undiscounted future results of the acquired
operation. The amount of enterprise-level goodwill impairment, if any, is
measured based on projected discounted future results using a discount rate
reflecting the Company's average cost of funds.

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS
 
    The Company accounts for its employee stock plans, which consist of fixed
stock option plans, an employee stock purchase plan, and a performance and
restricted stock plan, using the intrinsic value method.
 
    REVENUE RECOGNITION
 
    Application products revenue is recognized upon shipment. Revenue from
distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return and
price protection. The Company provides for estimated future returns at the time
the related revenue is recorded.
 
    Licensing revenue is recognized when the Company's OEM customers ship their
products incorporating Adobe's software. Revenue associated with adapting the
Company's software products to an OEM customer's hardware products is recognized
based on the percentage-of-completion method and is included in licensing
revenue.
 
    Deferred revenue includes customer advances under OEM licensing agreements.
Additionally, maintenance revenue for application products is deferred and
recognized ratably over the term of the contract, generally 12 months.
 
    DIRECT COSTS
 
    Direct costs include direct product, packaging, and shipping costs, as well
as royalties, localization costs, and amortization of acquired technologies.
 
    ADVERTISING COSTS
 
    Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
 
    INCOME TAXES
 
    The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing
assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce tax assets
to an amount whose realization is more likely than not.
 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING INSTRUMENTS
 
    The Company enters into foreign exchange contracts to hedge its foreign
currency risks. Such contracts must be effective at reducing the foreign
currency risk associated with the underlying transaction being hedged and must
be designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract. The Company, as a
matter of policy, does not engage in speculative transactions.
 
    The Company currently uses forward contracts as hedges of firmly committed
transactions. For these contracts, mark-to-market gains and losses are
recognized as other income or expense in the current period, generally
consistent with the period in which the gain or loss of the underlying
transaction is

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
recognized. All forward foreign currency contracts currently entered into by the
Company have maturities of 90 days or less.
 
    PUT WARRANTS AND CALL OPTIONS
 
    The Company utilizes put warrants and call option arrangements to facilitate
the repurchase of its common stock. In 1997, the Company can settle, at its
option, all outstanding puts and calls with physical delivery or net shares
equal to the difference between the exercise price and the market value at the
date of exercise. Accordingly, the potential repurchase obligation under these
arrangements is included in stockholders' equity. In 1996, the arrangements
required physical delivery, and accordingly, the potential buyback obligation
was removed from stockholders' equity and recorded as put warrants. Proceeds
from the sale of put warrants are recorded in stockholders' equity.
 
    NET INCOME PER SHARE
 
    Net income per share is based upon weighted average common and dilutive
common equivalent shares outstanding using the treasury stock method. Dilutive
common equivalent shares include stock options and restricted stock. The
difference between primary and fully diluted net income per share is not
significant in all periods presented.
 
    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
 
    In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 128, "Earnings Per
Share." SFAS No. 128 establishes a different method of computing net income per
share than is currently required under the provisions of Accounting Principles
Board Opinion No. 15. Under SFAS No. 128, the Company will be required to
present both basic net income per share and diluted net income per share. Basic
net income per share is expected to be higher than the currently presented net
income per share, as the effect of dilutive stock options will not be considered
in computing basic net income per share. Diluted net income per share is
expected to be comparable to the currently presented net income per share.
 
    The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 128 in its fiscal quarter ending
February 27, 1998, and at that time, all historical net income per share data
presented will be restated to conform to the provisions of SFAS No. 128.
 
    In June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive
Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for reporting and displaying
comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. It does
not, however, require a specific format for the disclosure but requires the
Company to display an amount representing total comprehensive income for the
period in its financial statements. The Company will be required to implement
SFAS No. 130 for its fiscal year 1999.
 
    Also in June 1997, the FASB issued SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures About Segments
of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes standards
for the manner in which public companies report information about operating
segments in annual and interim financial statements. The Company is currently
evaluating the operating segment information that it will be required to report.
The Company will be required to implement SFAS No. 131 for its fiscal year 1999.

NOTE 1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
    In October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition." SOP
97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of all aspects of
software revenue. SOP 97-2 is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 1997 and will require the Company to modify
certain aspects of its revenue recognition policies. The Company does not expect
the adoption of SOP 97-2 to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated
results of operations.
 
    RECLASSIFICATIONS
 
    Certain reclassifications were made to the 1996 and 1995 consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 1997 presentation.
 
NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS
 
    During 1997, 1996, and 1995, the Company acquired seven software companies,
in separate transactions, for an aggregate consideration of approximately $45.8
million in cash, notes payable, and the assumption of certain liabilities. These
acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and
resulted in the write-off of acquired in-process research and development of
$6.0 million, $21.3 million, and $15.0 million during fiscal 1997, 1996, and
1995, respectively. The operating results of the acquired companies have been
included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from their dates
of acquisition. The operating results of each company acquired are not
considered material to the consolidated financial statements of Adobe and,
accordingly, pro forma information has not been presented.
 
NOTE 3. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS
 
    All cash equivalents, short-term investments, and certain noncurrent
investments consisted of the following:

    The Company provides United States income taxes on the earnings of foreign

provided are approximately $32.7 million. The unrecognized deferred tax
liability for these earnings is approximately $4.0 million.
 
    As of November 28, 1997, the Company has foreign operating loss carryovers
in various jurisdictions of approximately $3.1 million with various expiration
dates. For financial reporting purposes, a valuation allowance has been
established to fully offset the deferred tax assets related to foreign operating
losses due to uncertainties in utilizing these losses. A valuation allowance has
also been established for certain deductions related to investments. Management
believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations
will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets.
 
    The Company's federal tax returns have been examined by the Internal Revenue
Service for all years through 1993. The Internal Revenue Service has proposed
assessments that the Company is contesting in Tax Court. Management believes
that any related adjustments that might be required will not have a material
effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.
 
NOTE 8. BENEFIT PLANS
 
    PRETAX SAVINGS PLAN
 
    In 1987, the Company adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is a pretax savings plan
covering substantially all of the Company's United States employees. Under the
plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 18% of their pretax salary,
subject to certain limitations. The Company matches approximately 25% of
employee contributions and contributed approximately $1.8 million, $1.6 million,
and $1.2 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. Matching contributions
can be terminated at the Company's discretion.
 
    ADOBE INCENTIVE PARTNERS
 
    In March 1997, as part of its venture investing program, the Company
established an internal limited partnership, Adobe Incentive Partners L.P.
("AIP"), which allows certain of the Company's executive officers to participate
in cash or stock distributions from Adobe's venture investments. Adobe is both
the general partner and a limited partner. Other limited partners are executive
officers of the Company who are involved in Adobe's venture investing activities
and whose participation is deemed critical to the success of the program.
 
    Adobe's Class A senior limited partnership interest includes both a
liquidation preference and a preference in recovery of the cost basis of each
specific investment. The executives' Class B junior limited partnership interest
qualifies for partnership distributions only after: (a) Adobe has fully
recovered the cost basis of its investment in the specific investee company for
which a distribution is made; and (b) the participating executive has vested in
his or her distribution rights. The distribution rights generally vest on a
monthly basis over three years, such that the rights are 25% vested after one
year, 50% vested after two years, and fully vested at the end of three years.
The limited partnership investments are restricted to investments in companies
that are private at the time of the establishment of AIP or when the investment
is made, whichever is later. Partnership interests may be allocated to
designated officers only while the investee company is still private. Class B
interests may not exceed a maximum of 20% of the venture investments included in
AIP.
 
    Assets held by AIP include Adobe's entire interests in Adobe Ventures L.P.
and Adobe Ventures II L.P. and equity securities of privately held companies. At
November 28, 1997, the cost basis of all

investments included in AIP was approximately $34.8 million. No distributions
were made to the participating officers in fiscal 1997, and expense related to
AIP in fiscal 1997 was immaterial. At November 28, 1997, the minority interest
held by the participating officers was immaterial and is included in accrued
expenses on the balance sheet.
 
NOTE 9. EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS
 
    STOCK OPTION PLANS
 
    As of November 28, 1997, the Company has reserved 29,200,000 shares of
common stock for issuance under its employee stock option plan. The employee
stock option plan provides for the granting of stock options to employees and
officers at the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the grant
date. Options generally vest 25% after the first year and ratably thereafter
such that 50% and 100% are vested after the second and third year, respectively.
The option terms range from five to ten years.
 
    The Company has reserved, as of November 28, 1997, 500,000 shares of common
stock for issuance under its Outside Directors Stock Option Plan, which provides
for the granting of nonqualified stock options to nonemployee directors. Option
grants are limited to 10,000 shares per person in each fiscal year, except for a
new nonemployee director, who may be granted 15,000 shares upon election as a
director. All options are immediately exercisable within a ten-year term. Any
exercised, unvested option shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at
the original purchase price upon termination of the director's service. Options
generally vest over three years: 25% in each of the first two years and 50% in
the third year.
 
    On March 22, 1996, the Company offered its employees a stock option
repricing program that allowed the employees to exchange on a two-for-three
share basis any options priced above the March 29, 1996 closing price of Adobe
stock, which was $32.25. As a result, approximately 1,252,000 options were
surrendered by eligible employees for approximately 834,000 repriced options.
The repriced options were not exercisable until November 1, 1996.
 
    Stock option activity for 1997, 1996, and 1995 is presented below:

    PERFORMANCE AND RESTRICTED STOCK PLAN
 
    The Performance and Restricted Stock Plan ("the Plan") provides for the
granting of restricted stock and/or performance units to officers and key
employees. As of November 28, 1997, the Company had reserved 1,500,000 shares of
its common stock for issuance under this plan. Restricted shares issued under
this plan generally vest annually over three years but are considered
outstanding at the time of grant, as the stockholders are entitled to dividends
and voting rights. As of November 28, 1997, 110,511 shares were outstanding and
not yet vested.
 
    In fiscal 1997, the Company granted 129,550 shares of restricted stock with
a weighted-average fair value of $39.04, and in fiscal 1996, the Company granted
26,750 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average fair value of $37.71.
 
    Performance units issued under this plan entitle the recipient to receive,
at the discretion of the Company, shares or cash upon completion of the
performance period subject to attaining identified performance goals.
Performance units are generally earned over a three-year period, and shares
earned are issued at the end of the three-year period. The ultimate value of the
performance units is dependent upon the Company's revenue and operating margin
growth (as defined by the Plan) during the three-year performance period
adjusted by a factor determined in 1997 by comparing the Company's return on
equity to the return on equity of a group of comparable companies. In 1996 and
1995, the factor was determined by comparing the growth in the Company's stock
price to an index of comparable stocks. The projected value of these units is
accrued by the Company and charged to expense over the three-year performance
period. As of November 28, 1997, November 29, 1996, and December 1, 1995,
performance units for 170,874; 94,745; and 75,420 shares were outstanding,
respectively, and $(2.1) million, $(0.2) million and $2.5 million was charged
(credited) to expense in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. In fiscal 1997 and
1996, performance units were granted for 156,500 and 48,965 shares,
respectively, and the weighted-average fair value of the shares were $39.04 and
$64.03, respectively.
 
    EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
 
    The Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows eligible employee
participants to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discount
through payroll deductions. The plan consists of two-

year offering periods with four six-month purchase periods in each offering
period. Employees purchase shares at 85% of the market value at either the
beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever
price is lower. As of November 28, 1997, the Company had reserved 7,000,000
shares of its common stock for issuance under this plan and 3,383,780 shares
remain available for future issuance.
 
    The weighted-average fair value of the purchase rights granted in fiscal
1997 and 1996 was $16.36 and $14.01, respectively.
 
    PRO FORMA FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
 
    The Company accounts for its employee stock plans, consisting of fixed stock
option plans, an employee stock purchase plan, and a performance and restricted
stock plan, using the intrinsic value method. The table below sets forth the pro
forma amounts of net income and net income per share that would have resulted if
the Company accounted for its employee stock plans under the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation."

NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
    STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN
 
    The Company's Stockholder Rights Plan is intended to protect stockholders
from unfair or coercive takeover practices. In accordance with this plan, the
Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one common stock purchase
right on each outstanding share of its common stock held as of July 24, 1990,
and on each share of common stock issued by the Company thereafter. Each right
entitles the registered holder to purchase from the Company a share of common
stock at $115. The rights become exercisable in certain circumstances including
upon an entity acquiring or announcing the intention to acquire beneficial
ownership of 20 percent or more of the Company's common stock without the
approval of the Board of Directors or upon the Company being acquired by any
person in a merger or business combination transaction. The rights are
redeemable by the Company prior to exercise at $0.01 per right and expire on
July 24, 2000.
 
    STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM
 
    In September 1997, the Board of Directors authorized, subject to certain
business and market conditions, the purchase of up to 15,000,000 shares of the
Company's stock over the next two years. The Company purchased 6,342,395 shares
and 3,390,240 shares of its common stock in 1997 and 1996,
respectively, at a cost of $275.6 million and $126.8 million, respectively,
under its stock repurchase programs as well as through employee stock option
exercise transactions. Prior to the Company's reincorporation in the State of
Delaware in May 1997, the shares purchased were returned to the status of
authorized and unissued as required by California law. The 5,175,851 shares
purchased at a cost of $238.7 million subsequent to the Company's
reincorporation are presented as treasury stock in the Stockholders' Equity
section of the balance sheet.
 
    PUT WARRANTS
 
    To facilitate the Company's stock repurchase programs, the Company sold put
warrants in a series of private placements in 1997 and 1996. Each warrant
entitled the holder to sell one share of Adobe's common stock to the Company at
a specified price. Approximately 4.6 million and 4.5 million put warrants were
written in 1997 and 1996, respectively. At November 28, 1997, approximately 2.9
million put warrants were outstanding that expire on various dates through May
1998 and have exercise prices ranging from $37.07 to $47.98 per share, with an
average exercise price of $43.09 per share. In addition, in 1997 and 1996, the
Company purchased call options from an independent third party that entitled the
Company to buy 2.3 million and 4.5 million shares, respectively, of its common
stock. At November 28, 1997, approximately 0.5 million call options were
outstanding that expire on various dates through April 1998 and have exercise
prices ranging from $37.32 to $46.86 per share, with an average exercise price
of $41.32 per share.
 
    As part of the Company's current stock repurchase programs, the Company may,
from time to time, enter into additional put warrant and call option
arrangements. Under these arrangements, the Company, at its option, can settle
with physical delivery or net shares equal to the difference between the
exercise price and market value at the date of exercise. Accordingly, the
arrangements do not require the reclassification of the obligation under put
warrants from equity, and no such reclassification of the Company's obligation
at November 28, 1997 has been made. Such arrangements were not in place at
November 29, 1996, and therefore, the Company's potential buyback obligation of
$71.3 million as of

NOTE 10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED)
November 29, 1996 was removed from stockholders' equity and recorded as put
warrants. In the future, the Company may consider other methods to acquire the
Company's stock including direct purchases, open market purchases, accelerated
stock purchase programs, and other potential methods.
 
    VENTURE STOCK DIVIDEND PROGRAM
 
    In March 1997, the Company established the venture stock dividend program
under which the Company may, from time to time, distribute as a dividend-in-kind
shares of its equity holdings in investee companies to Adobe stockholders. In
1997, the Company dividended one share of Netscape common stock for each 100
shares of Adobe common stock held by stockholders of record on July 31, 1997. An
equivalent cash dividend was paid for holdings of less than 2,500 Adobe shares
and for fractional Netscape shares. Also on December 1, 1997, the Company
dividended one share of Siebel common stock for each 300 shares of Adobe common
stock held by stockholders of record on October 31, 1997. An equivalent cash
dividend was paid for holdings of less than 7,500 Adobe shares and for
fractional Siebel shares. The declaration of future dividends under this program
is within the discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company and will
depend upon business conditions, the Company's results of operations and
financial condition, and other factors.
 
NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
    LEASE COMMITMENTS
 
    The Company has operating leases for its corporate headquarters, field sales
offices, and certain office equipment that expire at various dates through 2015.
Rent expense for these leases aggregated $17.8 million, $18.3 million, and $21.0
million during 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively. As of November 28, 1997,
future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases are as
follows: 1998 - $17.9 million; 1999 -$12.8 million; 2000--$9.3 million;
2001--$7.8 million; 2002--$3.0 million and $13.2 million, thereafter.
 
    REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT
 
    During 1994, the Company entered into a real estate development agreement
and an operating lease agreement in connection with the construction of an
office facility. In August 1996, the construction was completed, and the
operating lease commenced. The Company will have the option to purchase the
facility at the end of the lease term in October 2001. In the event the Company
chooses not to exercise this option, the Company is obligated to arrange for the
sale of the facility to an unrelated party and is required to pay the lessor any
difference between the net sales proceeds and the lessor's net investment in the
facility, in an amount not to exceed that which would preclude classification of
the lease as an operating lease, approximately $57.3 million. During the
construction period, the Company was required to pledge certain interest-bearing
instruments to the lessor as collateral to secure the performance of its
obligations under the lease. As of November 28, 1997, the Company's deposits
under this agreement totaled approximately $66.7 million in United States
government treasury notes and money market mutual funds. These deposits are
included in "Other assets" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    In 1996, the Company exercised its option under the development agreement to
begin a second phase of development for an additional office facility. In August
1996, the Company entered into a construction

agreement and an operating lease agreement for this facility. The operating
lease will commence on completion of construction in 1998. The Company will have
the option to purchase the facility at the end of the lease term (five years
after occupancy). In the event the Company chooses not to exercise this option,
the Company is obligated to arrange for the sale of the facility to an unrelated
party and is required to pay the lessor any difference between the net sales
proceeds and the lessor's net investment in the facility, in an amount not to
exceed that which would preclude classification of the lease as an operating
lease, approximately $64.3 million. The Company also is required, periodically
during the construction period, to deposit funds with the lessor as an
interest-bearing security deposit to secure the performance of its obligations
under the lease. During 1997, the Company deposited approximately $33.0 million,
and as of November 28, 1997, the Company's deposits under this agreement totaled
approximately $36.3 million. These deposits are included in "Other assets" in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 
    ROYALTIES
 
    The Company has certain royalty commitments associated with the shipment and
licensing of certain products. While royalty expense is generally based on a
dollar amount per unit shipped, ranging from $0.25 to $312, certain royalties
are based on a percentage, ranging from 0.03% to 12%, of the underlying revenue.
Royalty expense was approximately $25.0 million, $19.8 million, and $23.1
million in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
 
    LEGAL ACTIONS
 
    The Company is engaged in certain legal actions arising in the ordinary
course of business. The Company believes it has adequate legal defenses and that
the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on the
Company's financial position and results of operations.
 
NOTE 12. TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATE
 
    At November 28, 1997, the Company held a 13% equity interest in McQueen
International Limited ("McQueen") and accounts for the investment using the cost
method. During 1994, the Company entered into various agreements with McQueen,
whereby the Company contracted with McQueen to perform product localization and
technical support functions and to provide printing, assembly, and warehousing
services. Adobe makes minimum annual payments to McQueen for certain services
which amounted to $5.2 million and $4.8 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively,
and will be approximately $1.4 million in 1998. Purchases from McQueen amounted
to $35.0 million, $34.3 million, and $23.6 million during 1997, 1996, and 1995,
respectively.
 
    Effective December 31, 1997, McQueen was acquired by Sykes Enterprises,
Incorporated ("Sykes"), a publicly traded company. In connection with the
acquisition, the Company exchanged its shares of McQueen for 486,676 shares of
Sykes' restricted common stock and will record a gain on the exchange of $6.7
million in fiscal 1998. The Company's equity interest in Sykes is less than 2%.

NOTE 13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
    FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
 
    The Company's cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted funds,
and marketable equity securities are carried at fair value, based on quoted
market prices for these or similar investments. (See Note 3.)
 
    The Company's majority interest in Adobe Ventures L.P. and Adobe Ventures II
L.P. is carried at a combined value of $25.7 million which is believed to
approximate the fair value of underlying investments in technology companies.
Substantially all of the technology companies held by the limited partnerships
at November 28, 1997 are not publicly traded, and therefore there is no
established market for these investments. As such, these investments are valued
based on the most recent round of financing involving new non-strategic
investors and estimates made by the general partner, a third party. When
investments held by the limited partnerships are publicly traded, the fair value
of such investments is based on quoted market prices, and mark-to-market
adjustments are included in investment income. In general, as a matter of policy
of the limited partnerships, the investments in the technology companies held by
the limited partnerships will be distributed to the partners prior to the
investee company's initial public offering.
 
    FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING INSTRUMENTS
 
    The Company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency
exposures on a continuing basis for periods consistent with its committed
exposures. These transactions generally do not subject the Company to risk of
accounting loss because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and
gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. However, the
Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
the counterparties in these contracts. These contracts have maturities of less
than three months, and the amounts of unrealized gains and losses are
immaterial. The Company held $1.9 million of aggregate foreign currency forward
exchange contracts for the sale of the Japanese yen outstanding at the end of
fiscal year 1997. There were no foreign currency forward exchange contracts
outstanding at the end of fiscal 1996.
 
    CONCENTRATION OF RISK
 
    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk are primarily cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and
accounts receivable. The Company's investment portfolio consists of
investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries, and
issuers. The Company's investments are managed by recognized financial
institutions that follow the Company's investment policy. The Company's policy
limits the amount of credit exposure in any one issue, and the Company believes
no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these
investments.
 
    Credit risk in receivables is limited to OEM customers, and to dealers and
distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market. The Company
adopts credit policies and standards to keep pace with the evolving software
industry. Management believes that any risk of accounting loss is significantly
reduced due to the diversity of its products, end users, and geographic sales
areas. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers'
financial condition and requires letters of credit or other guarantees, whenever
deemed necessary.

NOTE 13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)
    A significant portion of the Company's licensing revenue is derived from a
small number of OEM customers. The Company's OEM customers on occasion seek to
renegotiate their royalty arrangements. The Company evaluates these requests on
a case-by-case basis. If an agreement is not reached, a customer may decide to
pursue other options, which could result in lower licensing revenue for the
Company. Also, in the fall of 1997, one of Adobe's largest PostScript customers,
Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP"), introduced a non-Adobe clone version of
PostScript in one family of monochrome laser printers.
 
    INDUSTRY SEGMENT
 
    Adobe and its subsidiaries operate in one dominant industry segment, as
defined by SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business
Enterprise." The Company is engaged principally in the design, development,
manufacture, and licensing of computer software. No customer accounted for more
than 10% of the Company's total revenue in 1997, 1996, or 1995.

     SECTION 5.     ANNUAL MEETING.

          (a)  The annual meeting of the stockholders of the corporation, for
the purpose of election of directors and for such other business as may lawfully
come before it, shall be held on such date and at such time as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors.

          (b)  At an annual meeting of the stockholders, only such business
shall be conducted as shall have been properly brought before the meeting.  To
be properly brought before an annual meeting, business must be:  (A) specified
in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the
direction of the Board of Directors, (B) otherwise properly brought before the
meeting by or at the direction of the Board of Directors, or (C) otherwise
properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder.  For business to be
properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must
have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation.
To be timely, a stockholder proposal to be presented an annual meeting shall be
received at the corporation's principal executive offices not less than one
hundred twenty (120) calendar days in advance of the date that the corporation's
(or the corporation's predecessor's) proxy statement was released to
stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of
stockholders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event that no annual meeting was
held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting has been changed by
more than thirty (30) days from the date contemplated at the time of the
previous year's proxy statement, or in the event of a special meeting, notice by
the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which a notice of the date
of the meeting was mailed or a public announcement thereof was made. A
stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the
stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:  (i) a brief
description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and
the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name
and address, as they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder
proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the corporation
which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, (iv) any material interest of
the stockholder in such business and (v) any other information that is required
to be provided by the stockholder pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), in his capacity as
a proponent to a stockholder proposal.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order
to include information with respect to a stockholder proposal in the proxy
statement and form of proxy for a stockholder's meeting, stockholders must
provide notice as required by the regulations promulgated under the 1934 Act. 
Notwithstanding anything in these Bylaws to the contrary, no business shall be
conducted at any annual meeting except in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this paragraph (b).  The chairman of the annual meeting shall, if the
facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that business was not
properly brought before the meeting and in accordance with the provisions of
this paragraph (b), and, if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the
meeting that any such business not properly brought before the meeting shall not
be transacted.

                                                                             2
<PAGE>

          (c)  Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this paragraph (c) shall be eligible for election as directors. 
Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors of the corporation
may be made at a meeting of stockholders by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or by any stockholder of the corporation entitled to vote in the
election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set
forth in this paragraph (c).  Such nominations, other than those made by or at
the direction of the Board of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice
in writing to the Secretary of the corporation in accordance with the provisions
of paragraph (b) of this Section 5.  Such stockholder's notice shall set forth
(i) as to each person, if any, whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for
election or re-election as a director:  (A) the name, age, business address and
residence address of such person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of
such person, (C) the class and number of shares of the corporation which are
beneficially owned by such person, (D) a description of all arrangements or
understandings between the stockholder and each nominee and any other person or
persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nominations are to
be made by the stockholder, and (E) any other information relating to such
person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election
of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A
under the 1934 Act (including without limitation such person's written consent
to being named in the proxy statement, if any, as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected); and (ii) as to such stockholder giving notice, the
information required to be provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 5.
At the request of the Board of Directors, any person nominated by a stockholder
for election as a director shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation
that information required to be set forth in the stockholder's notice of
nomination which pertains to the nominee.  No person shall be eligible for
election as a director of the corporation unless nominated in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this paragraph (c).  The chairman of the meeting
shall, if the facts warrant, determine and declare at the meeting that a
nomination was not made in accordance with the procedures prescribed by these
Bylaws, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare at the meeting, and
the defective nomination shall be disregarded.

          (d)  For purposes of this Section 5, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated
Press, Business Wire or comparable national news service or in a document
publicly filed by the corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

                                                                             3
<PAGE>

     SECTION 6.     SPECIAL MEETINGS.

          (a)  Special meetings of the stockholders of the corporation may be
called, for any purpose or purposes, by (i) the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, (ii) the President, (iii) the Board of Directors pursuant to a
resolution adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors
(whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships
at the time any such resolution is presented to the Board of Directors for
adoption) or (iv) by the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten
percent (10%) of the votes at the meeting, and shall be held at such place, on
such date, and at such time as the Board of Directors, shall fix.

          (b)  If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other
than the Board of Directors, the request shall be in writing, specifying the
general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered
personally or sent by registered mail or by telegraphic or other facsimile
transmission to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive
Officer, or the Secretary of the corporation.  No business may be transacted at
such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice.  The Board of
Directors shall determine the time and place of such special meeting, which
shall be held not less than thirty-five (35) nor more than one hundred twenty
(120) days after the date of the receipt of the request.  Upon determination of
the time and place of the meeting, the officer receiving the request shall cause
notice to be given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7 of these Bylaws.  If the notice is not given within
sixty (60) days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons
requesting the meeting may set the time and place of the meeting and give the
notice.  Nothing contained in this paragraph (b) shall be construed as limiting,
fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of
the Board of Directors may be held.

     SECTION 7.     NOTICE OF MEETINGS.  Except as otherwise provided by law or
the Certificate of Incorporation, written notice of each meeting of stockholders
shall be given not less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days before
the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting,
such notice to specify the place, date and hour and purpose or purposes of the
meeting.  Notice of the time, place and purpose of any meeting of stockholders
may be waived in writing, signed by the person entitled to notice thereof,
either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any stockholder by
his attendance thereat in person or by proxy, except when the stockholder
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened.  Any stockholder so waiving notice of such meeting shall be
bound by the proceedings of any such meeting in all respects as if due notice
thereof had been given.

     SECTION 8.     QUORUM.  At all meetings of stockholders, except where
otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by
these Bylaws, the presence, in 

                                                                             4
<PAGE>

person or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of a majority of the 
outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for 
the transaction of business.  In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of 
stockholders may be adjourned, from time to time, either by the chairman of 
the meeting or by vote of the holders of a majority of the shares represented 
thereat, but no other business shall be transacted at such meeting.  The 
stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which a quorum 
is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment, 
notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a 
quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by law, the Certificate of 
Incorporation or these Bylaws, all action taken by the holders of a majority 
of the vote cast, excluding abstentions, at any meeting at which a quorum is 
present shall be valid and binding upon the corporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, 
that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares 
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote 
on the election of directors.  Where a separate vote by a class or classes or 
series is required, except where otherwise provided by the statute or by the 
Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, a majority of the outstanding 
shares of such class or classes or series, present in person or represented 
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum entitled to take action with respect to 
that vote on that matter and, except where otherwise provided by the statute 
or by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the affirmative vote 
of the majority (plurality, in the case of the election of directors) of the 
votes cast, including abstentions, by the holders of shares of such class or 
classes or series shall be the act of such class or classes or series.

     SECTION 9.     ADJOURNMENT AND NOTICE OF ADJOURNED MEETINGS.  Any meeting
of stockholders, whether annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time
either by the chairman of the meeting or by the vote of a majority of the shares
casting votes, excluding abstentions.  When a meeting is adjourned to another
time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and
place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. 
At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business, which might
have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more
than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for
the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

     SECTION 10.    VOTING RIGHTS.  For the purpose of determining those
stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as
otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the stock
records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12 of
these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders.  Every
person entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person or by an
agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with Delaware law. 
An agent so appointed need not be a stockholder.  No proxy shall be voted after
three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a longer
period.

                                                                             5
<PAGE>

     SECTION 11.    JOINT OWNERS OF STOCK.  If shares or other securities having
voting power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether
fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common, tenants
by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the same
fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is given
written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the instrument or
order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is so provided,
their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:  (a) if only
one (1) votes, his or her act binds all; (b) if more than one (1) votes, the act
of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1) votes, but the
vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may vote the
securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware Court of
Chancery for relief as provided in the General Corporation Law of Delaware,
Section 217(b).  If the instrument filed with the Secretary shows that any such
tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or even-split for the purpose
of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split in interest.

     SECTION 12.    LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS.  The Secretary shall prepare and make,
at least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of
the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical
order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the
examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during
ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the
meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held,
which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not
specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held.  The list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of meeting during the whole time thereof
and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.

     SECTION 13.    ACTION WITHOUT MEETING.  No action shall be taken by the
stockholders except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in
accordance with these Bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders
by written consent.

     SECTION 14.    ORGANIZATION.

          (a)  At every meeting of stockholders, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, or, if a Chairman has not been appointed or is absent, the Chief
Executive Officer, or if the Chief Executive has not been appointed or is
absent, the President, or, if the President is absent, a chairman of the meeting
chosen by a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote, present
in person or by proxy, shall act as chairman.  The Secretary, or, in his or her
absence, an Assistant Secretary directed to do so by the President, shall act as
secretary of the meeting.

          (b)  The Board of Directors of the corporation shall be entitled to
make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of stockholders as it
shall deem necessary, appropriate or convenient.  Subject to such rules and
regulations of the Board of Directors, if any, the chairman of the meeting shall
have the right and authority to prescribe such rules,

                                                                             6
<PAGE>

regulations and procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of 
such chairman, are necessary, appropriate or convenient for the proper 
conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an agenda 
or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for maintaining 
order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations on 
participation in such meeting to stockholders of record of the corporation 
and their duly authorized and constituted proxies and such other persons as 
the chairman shall permit, restrictions on entry to the meeting after the 
time fixed for the commencement thereof, limitations on the time allotted to 
questions or comments by participants and regulation of the opening and 
closing of the polls for balloting on matters which are to be voted on by 
ballot.  Unless and to the extent determined by the Board of Directors or the 
chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be 
held in accordance with rules of parliamentary procedure.

                                      ARTICLE IV

                                      DIRECTORS

     SECTION 15.    NUMBER AND TERM OF OFFICE.  The authorized number of
directors of the corporation shall be fixed in accordance with the Certificate
of Incorporation.  Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the
Certificate of Incorporation.  If for any cause, the directors shall not have
been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as
convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in
the manner provided in these Bylaws.

     SECTION 16.    POWERS.  The powers of the corporation shall be exercised,
its business conducted and its property controlled by the Board of Directors,
except as may be otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of
Incorporation.

     SECTION 17.    CLASSES OF DIRECTORS.  Subject to the rights of the holders
of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified
circumstances, the directors shall be divided into two classes designated as
Class I and Class II, respectively. Directors shall be assigned to each class in
accordance with a resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors. 
At the first annual meeting of stockholders following November 30, 1997, the
term of office of the Class I directors shall expire and Class I directors shall
be elected for a full term of two years.  At the second annual meeting of
stockholders following November 30, 1997, the term of office of the Class II
directors shall expire and Class II directors shall be elected for a full term
of two years.  At each succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, directors
shall be elected for a full term of two years to succeed the directors of the
class whose terms expire at such annual meeting.

                                                                             7
<PAGE>

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, each director
shall serve until his successor is duly elected and qualified or until his
death, resignation or removal.  No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

     SECTION 18.    VACANCIES.  Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death,
resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created
directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors, shall
unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies
or newly created directorships shall be filled by stockholders, be filled only
by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even
though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors.  Any director elected in
accordance with the preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of
the full term of the director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and
until such director's successor shall have been elected and qualified.  A
vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be deemed to exist under this Bylaw in
the case of the death, removal or resignation of any director.

     SECTION 19.    RESIGNATION.  Any director may resign at any time by
delivering his written resignation to the Secretary, such resignation to specify
whether it will be effective at a particular time, upon receipt by the Secretary
or at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  If no such specification is made,
it shall be deemed effective at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.  When
one or more directors shall resign from the Board of Directors, effective at a
future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who
have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote
thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become
effective, and each Director so chosen shall hold office for the unexpired
portion of the term of the Director whose place shall be vacated and until his
successor shall have been duly elected and qualified.

     SECTION 20.    REMOVAL.

to the members of such committee of the time and place of such special 
meeting given in the manner provided for the giving of written notice to 
members of the Board of Directors of the time and place of special meetings

which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing

such other person as may be authorized by the Board of Directors, and the
corporate seal impressed thereon or a facsimile of such seal imprinted thereon
and attested by the signature of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the
Chief Financial Officer or Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that where any such bond, debenture or other corporate security shall
be authenticated by the manual signature, or where permissible facsimile
signature, of a trustee under an indenture pursuant to which such bond,
debenture or other corporate security shall be issued, the signatures of the
persons signing and attesting the corporate seal on such bond, debenture or

such persons.  Interest coupons appertaining to any such bond, debenture or
other corporate security, authenticated by a trustee as aforesaid, shall be
signed by the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of

such interest coupon, shall have ceased to be such officer before the bond,
debenture or other corporate security so signed or attested shall have been
delivered, such bond, debenture or other corporate security nevertheless may be
adopted by the corporation and issued and delivered as though the person who
signed the same or whose facsimile signature shall have been used thereon had

                                      DIVIDENDS

     SECTION 40.    DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS.  Dividends upon the capital stock
of the corporation, subject to the provisions of the Certificate of
Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors pursuant to law
at any regular or special meeting.  Dividends may be paid in cash, in property,
or in shares of the capital stock, subject to the provisions of the Certificate
of Incorporation.

     SECTION 41.    DIVIDEND RESERVE.  Before payment of any dividend, there may
be set aside out of any funds of the corporation available for dividends such
sum or sums as the Board of Directors from time to time, in their absolute
discretion, think proper as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for
equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property

                                                                            18

of the corporation, or for such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall 
think conducive to the interests of the corporation, and the Board of 
Directors may modify or abolish any such reserve in the manner in which it 
was created.

                                      ARTICLE XI

                                   INDEMNIFICATION

     SECTION 43.    INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, OTHER
                    OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS.

          (a)  DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  The corporation shall
indemnify its directors and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article
XI, "executive officers shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated
under the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General
Corporation Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the corporation may modify the extent
of such indemnification by individual contracts with its directors and executive
officers; and, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that the corporation shall not be required to
indemnify any director or executive officer in connection with any proceeding
(or part thereof) initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is
expressly required to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the
Board of Directors of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by
the corporation, in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the
corporation under the Delaware General Corporation Law or (iv) such
indemnification is required to be made under subsection (d).

          (b)  OTHER OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND OTHER AGENTS.  The corporation
shall have power to indemnify its other officers, employees and other agents as
set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law.

          (c)  EXPENSES.  The corporation shall advance to any person who was or
is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
executive officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director or executive officer of another corporation,
partnership,

                                                                            19
<PAGE>

joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to the final disposition of 
the proceeding, promptly following request therefor, all expenses incurred by 
any director or executive officer in connection with such proceeding upon 
receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay said 
amounts if it should be determined ultimately that such person is not 
entitled to be indemnified under this Bylaw or otherwise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless otherwise determined pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Bylaw, no advance shall be made by the corporation to an
executive officer of the corporation (except by reason of the fact that such
executive officer is or was a director of the corporation in which event this
paragraph shall not apply) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, if a determination is reasonably and
promptly made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum
consisting of directors who were not parties to the proceeding, or (ii) if such
quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested
directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, that
the facts known to the decision-making party at the time such determination is
made demonstrate clearly and convincingly that such person acted in bad faith or
in a manner that such person did not believe to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation.

          (d)  ENFORCEMENT.  Without the necessity of entering into an 
express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and 
executive officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights 
and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract 
between the corporation and the director or executive officer.  Any right to 
indemnification or advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or executive 
officer shall be enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right 
in any court of competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification 
or advances is denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such 
claim is made within ninety (90) days of request therefor.  The claimant in 
such enforcement action, if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled 
to be paid also the expense of prosecuting his claim.  In connection with any 
claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be entitled to raise as a 
defense to any such action that the claimant has not met the standards of 
conduct that make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation Law 
for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed.  In 
connection with any claim by an executive officer of the corporation (except 
in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or 
investigative, by reason of the fact that such executive officer is or was a 
director of the corporation) for advances, the corporation shall be entitled 
to raise a defense as to any such action clear and convincing evidence that 
such person acted in bad faith or in a manner that such person did not 
believe to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, or 
with respect to any criminal action or proceeding that such person acted 
without reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was lawful. Neither the 
failure of the corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent 
legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the 
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in 
the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set 
forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, nor an actual determination by 
the corporation

                                                                            20
<PAGE>

(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its 
stockholders) that the claimant has not met such applicable standard of 
conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that 
claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.  In any suit brought 
by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or 
to an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the 
director or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such 
advancement of expenses, under this Article XI or otherwise shall be on the 
corporation.

          (e)  NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS.  The rights conferred on any person by
this Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have
or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to
action in another capacity while holding office.  The corporation is
specifically authorized to enter into individual contracts with any or all of
its directors, officers, employees or agents respecting indemnification and
advances, to the fullest extent not prohibited by the Delaware General
Corporation Law.

          (f)  SURVIVAL OF RIGHTS.  The rights conferred on any person by this
Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person.

          (g)  INSURANCE.  To the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware
General Corporation Law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of
Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted
to be indemnified pursuant to this Bylaw.

          (h)  AMENDMENTS.  Any repeal or modification of this Bylaw shall only
be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in effect at the
time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act that is the
cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation.

          (i)  SAVING CLAUSE.  If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be
invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to
the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this Bylaw that
shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law.

          (j)  CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  For the purposes of this Bylaw, the
following definitions shall apply:

               (i)  The term "proceeding" shall be broadly construed and shall
     include, without limitation, the investigation, preparation, prosecution,
     defense, settlement, arbitration and appeal of, and the giving of testimony
     in, any threatened, pending or

                                                                            21
<PAGE>

     completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, 
     administrative or investigative.

               (ii) The term "expenses" shall be broadly construed and shall
     include, without limitation, court costs, attorneys' fees, witness fees,
     fines, amounts paid in settlement or judgment and any other costs and
     expenses of any nature or kind incurred in connection with any proceeding.

               (iii)     The term the "corporation" shall include, in addition
     to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any
     constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which,
     if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority
     to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any
     person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such
     constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such
     constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
     another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise,
     shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Bylaw with
     respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he would have with
     respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had
     continued.

               (iv) References to a "director," "executive officer," "officer,"
     "employee," or "agent" of the corporation shall include, without
     limitation, situations where such person is serving at the request of the
     corporation as, respectively, a director, executive officer, officer,
     employee, trustee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
     venture, trust or other enterprise.

               (v)  References to "other enterprises" shall include employee
     benefit plans; references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes
     assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; and
     references to "serving at the request of the corporation" shall include any
     service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation which
     imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer,
     employee, or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its
     participants, or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in
     a manner he reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants
     and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted
     in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as
     referred to in this Bylaw.

                                                                            22

                                       NOTICES

     SECTION 44.    NOTICES.

          (a)  NOTICE TO STOCKHOLDERS.  Whenever, under any provisions of these
Bylaws, notice is required to be given to any stockholder, it shall be given in
writing, timely and duly deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
and addressed to his last known post office address as shown by the stock record
of the corporation or its transfer agent.

          (b)  NOTICE TO DIRECTORS.  Any notice required to be given to any
director may be given by the method stated in subsection (a), or by facsimile,
telex or telegram, except that such notice other than one which is delivered
personally shall be sent to such address as such director shall have filed in
writing with the Secretary, or, in the absence of such filing, to the last known
post office address of such director.

          (c)  AFFIDAVIT OF MAILING.  An affidavit of mailing, executed by a
duly authorized and competent employee of the corporation or its transfer agent
appointed with respect to the class of stock affected, specifying the name and
address or the names and addresses of the stockholder or stockholders, or
director or directors, to whom any such notice or notices was or were given, and
the time and method of giving the same, shall in the absence of fraud, be prima
facie evidence of the facts therein contained.

          (d)  TIME NOTICES DEEMED GIVEN.  All notices given by mail, as above
provided, shall be deemed to have been given as at the time of mailing, and all
notices given by facsimile, telex or telegram shall be deemed to have been given
as of the sending time recorded at time of transmission.

          (e)  METHODS OF NOTICE.  It shall not be necessary that the same
method of giving notice be employed in respect of all directors, but one
permissible method may be employed in respect of any one or more, and any other
permissible method or methods may be employed in respect of any other or others.

          (f)  FAILURE TO RECEIVE NOTICE.  The period or limitation of time
within which any stockholder may exercise any option or right, or enjoy any
privilege or benefit, or be required to act, or within which any director may
exercise any power or right, or enjoy any privilege, pursuant to any notice sent
him in the manner above provided, shall not be affected or extended in any
manner by the failure of such stockholder or such director to receive such
notice.

          (g)  NOTICE TO PERSON WITH WHOM COMMUNICATION IS UNLAWFUL.  Whenever
notice is required to be given, under any provision of law or of the Certificate
of Incorporation or

                                                                            23
<PAGE>

Bylaws of the corporation, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, 
the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there 
shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a 
license or permit to give such notice to such person.  Any action or meeting 
which shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom 
communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such 
notice had been duly given.  In the event that the action taken by the 
corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any 
provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate shall 
state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given 
to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom 
communication is unlawful.

          (h)  NOTICE TO PERSON WITH UNDELIVERABLE ADDRESS.  Whenever notice is
required to be given, under any provision of law or the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the corporation, to any stockholder to whom
(i) notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings or of
the taking of action by written consent without a meeting to such person during
the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or (ii) all, and at
least two, payments (if sent by first class mail) of dividends or interest on
securities during a twelve-month period, have been mailed addressed to such
person at his address as shown on the records of the corporation and have been
returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be
required.  Any action or meeting which shall be taken or held without notice to
such person shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly
given.  If any such person shall deliver to the corporation a written notice
setting forth his then current address, the requirement that notice be given to
such person shall be reinstated.  In the event that the action taken by the
corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate under any
provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the certificate need not
state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be
given pursuant to this paragraph.


                                     ARTICLE XIII

                                      AMENDMENTS

     SECTION 45.    AMENDMENTS.  Subject to paragraph (h) of Section 43 of the
Bylaws, the Bylaws may be altered or amended or new Bylaws adopted by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all of the
then-outstanding shares of the Voting Stock.  The Board of Directors shall also
have the power to adopt, amend, or repeal the Bylaws.

                                                                            24

                                  LOANS TO OFFICERS

     SECTION 46.    LOANS TO OFFICERS.  The corporation may lend money to, or
guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other employee
of the corporation or of its subsidiaries, including any officer or employee who
is a Director of the corporation or its subsidiaries, whenever, in the judgment
of the Board of Directors, such loan, guarantee or assistance may reasonably be
expected to benefit the corporation.  The loan, guarantee or other assistance
may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner
as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge
of shares of stock of the corporation.  Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed
to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation
at common law or under any statute.


                                      ARTICLE XV

                                    MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 47.    ANNUAL REPORT.

          (a)  Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Bylaw, the
Board of Directors shall cause an annual report to be sent to each stockholder
of the corporation not later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the close
of the corporation's fiscal year.  Such report shall include a balance sheet as
of the end of such fiscal year and an income statement and statement of changes
in financial position for such fiscal year, accompanied by any report thereon of
independent accountants, or if there is no such report, the certificate of an
authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without
audit from the books and records of the corporation.

          When there are more than one hundred (100) stockholders of record of
the corporation's shares, as determined by Section 605 of the California
Corporations Code, additional information as required by Section 1501(b) of the
California Corporations Code shall also be contained in such report, provided
that if the corporation has a class of securities registered under Section 12 of
the 1934 Act, that Act shall take precedence.  Such report shall be sent to
stockholders at least fifteen (15) days prior to the next annual meeting of
stockholders after the end of the fiscal year to which it relates.

          (b)  If and so long as there are fewer than 100 holders of record of
the corporation's shares, the requirement of sending of an annual report to the
stockholders of the corporation is hereby expressly waived.

                                                                            25

                      OF THE VOTING POWERS, DESIGNATION,

                      LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE
                           SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK



                        Pursuant to Section 151 of the
                          General Corporation Law of
                             the State of Delaware



     I, John E. Warnock, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of 
Adobe Systems Incorporated, a corporation organized and existing under the 
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "CORPORATION"), DO 
HEREBY CERTIFY:

     that, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board of Directors of the 
Corporation by its Certificate of Incorporation (the "CERTIFICATE"), and, 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 151 of the General Corporation Law of 
the State of Delaware, said Board of Directors, at a duly called meeting held 
on July 30, 1997, at which a quorum was present and acted throughout, adopted 
the following resolutions, which resolutions remain in full force and effect 
on the date hereof creating a series of 100,000 shares of Preferred Stock 
having a par value of $.0001 per share, designated as Series A Preferred 
Stock (the "SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK") out of the class of 2,000,000 shares 
of preferred stock of the par value of $.0001 per share (the "PREFERRED 
STOCK"):

     RESOLVED, that pursuant to the authority vested in the Board of 
Directors in accordance with the provisions of the Certificate, the Board of 
Directors does hereby create, authorize and provide for the issuance of the 
Series A Preferred Stock having the voting powers, designation, relative, 
participating, optional and other special rights, preferences, and 
qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof that are set forth as 
follows:

     Section 1.  DESIGNATION AND AMOUNT.  The shares of such series shall be 
designated as "Series A Preferred Stock" and the number of shares 
constituting such series shall be 100,000.

     Section 2.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.  (A)  Subject to the prior and 
superior rights of the holders of any shares of any other series of Preferred 
Stock or any other shares of preferred stock of the Corporation ranking prior 
and superior to the shares of Series A Preferred Stock with respect to 
dividends, each holder of one one-


<PAGE>

thousandth (1/1,000) of a share (a "UNIT") of Series A Preferred Stock shall 
be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors 
out of funds legally available for that purpose, (i) quarterly dividends 
payable in cash on the last day of March, June, September and December in 
each year (each such date being a "QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT DATE"), 
commencing on the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date after the first 
issuance of such Unit of Series A Preferred Stock, in an amount per Unit 
(rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the greater of (a) $.01 or (b) subject 
to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, the aggregate per 
share amount of all cash dividends declared on shares of the Common Stock 
since the immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or, with 
respect to the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first 
issuance of a Unit of Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) subject to the 
provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, quarterly distributions 
(payable in kind) on each Quarterly Dividend Payment Date in an amount per 
Unit equal to the aggregate per share amount of all non-cash dividends or 
other distributions (other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock 
or a subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, by 
reclassification or otherwise) declared on shares of Common Stock since the 
immediately preceding Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, or with respect to the 
first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, since the first issuance of a Unit of 
Series A Preferred Stock.  In the event that the Corporation shall at any 
time after July 11, 1990 (the "RIGHTS DECLARATION DATE") (i) declare any 
dividend on outstanding shares of Common Stock payable in shares of Common 
Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding shares of Common Stock or (iii) combine 
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in 
each such case the amount to which the holder of a Unit of Series A Preferred 
Stock was entitled immediately prior to such event pursuant to the preceding 
sentence shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the 
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that are 
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall 
be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately 
prior to such event.

     (B)  The Corporation shall declare a dividend or distribution on Units 
of Series A Preferred Stock as provided in paragraph (A) above immediately 
after it declares a dividend or distribution on the shares of Common Stock 
(other than a dividend payable in shares of Common Stock); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, 
that, in the event no dividend or distribution shall have been declared on 
the Common Stock during the period between any Quarterly Dividend Payment 
Date and the next subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, a dividend of 
$.01 per Unit on the Series A Preferred Stock shall nevertheless be payable 
on such subsequent Quarterly Dividend Payment Date.


                                       2
<PAGE>

     (C)  Dividends shall begin to accrue and shall be cumulative on each 
outstanding Unit of Series A Preferred Stock from the Quarterly Dividend 
Payment Date next preceding the date of issuance of such Unit of Series A 
Preferred Stock, unless the date of issuance of such Unit is prior to the 
record date for the first Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in which case, 
dividends on such Unit shall begin to accrue from the date of issuance of 
such Unit, or unless the date of issuance is a Quarterly Dividend Payment 
Date or is a date after the record date for the determination of holders of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive a quarterly dividend 
and before such Quarterly Dividend Payment Date, in either of which events 
such dividends shall begin to accrue and be cumulative from such Quarterly 
Dividend Payment Date.  Accrued but unpaid dividends shall not bear interest. 
Dividends paid on Units of Series A Preferred Stock in an amount less than 
the aggregate amount of all such dividends at the time accrued and payable on 
such Units shall be allocated pro rata on a unit-by-unit basis among all 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding.  The Board of 
Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend or 
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 30 
days prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

     Section 3.  VOTING RIGHTS.  The holders of Units of Series A Preferred 
Stock shall have the following voting rights:

     (A)  Subject to the provision for adjustment hereinafter set forth, each 
Unit of Series A Preferred Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote 
on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the Corporation.  
In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights Declaration 
Date (i) declare any dividend on outstanding shares of Common Stock payable 
in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding shares of Common Stock 
or (iii) combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number 
of shares, then in each such case the number of votes per Unit to which 
holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately prior 
to such event shall be adjusted by multiplying such number by a fraction the 
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding 
immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall be the number 
of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to such 
event.

     (B)  Except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of Units 
of Series A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall 
vote together as one class on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
of the Corporation.


                                       3

     (C)  (i)  If at any time dividends on any Units of Series A Preferred 
Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends 
thereon, then during the period (a "DEFAULT PERIOD") from the occurrence of 
such event until such time as all accrued and unpaid dividends for all 
previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend 
period on all Units of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have 
been declared and paid or set apart for payment, all holders of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, shall have the right 
to elect two Directors.

     (ii)  During any default period, such voting rights of the holders of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special 
meeting called pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this Section 3(C) or at any 
annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of 
stockholders, provided that neither such voting rights nor any right of the 
holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock to increase, in certain cases, 
the authorized number of Directors may be exercised at any meeting unless 
one-third of the outstanding Units of Preferred Stock shall be present at 
such meeting in person or by proxy.  The absence of a quorum of the holders 
of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock of such rights.  At any meeting at which the holders 
of Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting rights 
initially during an existing default period, they shall have the right, 
voting separately as a class, to elect Directors to fill up to two vacancies 
in the Board of Directors, if any such vacancies may then exist, or, if such 
right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two Directors.  If the 
number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the 
required number, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall have the 
right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary 
to permit the election by them of the required number.  After the holders of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect 
Directors during any default period, the number of Directors shall not be 
increased or decreased except as approved by a vote of the holders of Units 
of Series A Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of 
any equity securities ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock.

     (iii)  Unless the holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall, during an 
existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect 
Directors, the Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or 
stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 25% of the total number of 
the Units of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding may request, the calling of 
a special meeting of the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock, which 
meeting shall thereupon be called by the Secretary of the Corporation.  
Notice of such meeting and of any annual meeting at which holders of Units of 
Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph 
(C)(iii) 


                                      4
<PAGE>

shall be given to each holder of record of Units of Series A Preferred Stock 
by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same 
appears on the books of the Corporation.  Such meeting shall be called for a 
time not earlier than 20 days and not later then 60 days after such order or 
request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after 
such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar notice by any 
stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 25% of the 
total number of outstanding Units of Series A Preferred Stock.  
Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (C)(iii), no such special 
meeting shall be called during the 60 days immediately preceding the date 
fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders.

     (iv)  During any default period, the holders of shares of Common Stock 
and Units of Series A Preferred Stock, and other classes or series of stock 
of the Corporation, if applicable, shall continue to be entitled to elect all 
the Directors until holders of the Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall 
have exercised their right to elect two Directors voting as a separate class, 
after the exercise of which right (x) the Directors so elected by the holders 
of Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall continue in office until their 
successors shall have been elected by such holders or until the expiration of 
the default period, and (y) any vacancy in the Board of Directors may (except 
as provided in paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3) be filled by vote of a 
majority of the remaining Directors theretofore elected by the holders of the 
class of capital stock which elected the Director whose office shall have 
become vacant.  References in this paragraph (C) to Directors elected by the 
holders of a particular class of capital stock shall include Directors 
elected by such Directors to fill vacancies as provided in clause (y) of the 
foregoing sentence.

     (v)  Immediately upon the expiration of a default period, (x) the right 
of the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class to 
elect Directors shall cease, (y) the term of any Directors elected by the 
holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock as a separate class shall 
terminate, and (z) the number of Directors shall be such number as may be 
provided for in the Certificate or by-laws irrespective of any increase made 
pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (C)(ii) of this Section 3 (such 
number being subject, however, to change thereafter in any manner provided by 
law or in the Certificate or by-laws).  Any vacancies in the Board of 
Directors effected by the provisions of clauses (y) and (z) in the preceding 
sentence may be filled by a majority of the remaining Directors.

     (vi)  The provisions of this paragraph (C) shall govern the election of 
Directors by holders of Units of Preferred Stock during any default period 
notwithstanding any provisions of the Certificate to the contrary, including, 
without limitation, the 


                                       5
<PAGE>

provisions of Article V of the Certificate.

     (D)  Except as set forth herein, holders of Units of Series A Preferred 
Stock shall have no special voting rights and their consents shall not be 
required (except to the extent they are entitled to vote with holders of 
shares of Common Stock as set forth herein) for taking any corporate action.

     Section 4.  CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS.  (A)  Whenever quarterly dividends or 
other dividends or distributions payable on Units of Series A Preferred Stock 
as provided in Section 2 are in arrears, thereafter and until all accrued and 
unpaid dividends and distributions, whether or not declared, on outstanding 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, the 
Corporation shall not

          (i)  declare or pay dividends on, make any other distributions on, 
     or redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares 
     of junior stock;

          (ii) declare or pay dividends on or make any other distributions on 
     any shares of parity stock, except dividends paid ratably on Units of 
     Series A Preferred Stock and shares of all such parity stock on which 
     dividends are payable or in arrears in proportion to the total amounts 
     to which the holders of such Units and all such shares are then entitled;

          (iii)     redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration 
     shares of any parity stock, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Corporation may 
     at any time redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire shares of any such 
     parity stock in exchange for shares of any junior stock;

          (iv) purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any Units of 
     Series A Preferred Stock, except in accordance with a purchase offer 
     made in writing or by publication (as determined by the Board of 
     Directors) to all holders of such Units.

          (B)  The Corporation shall not permit any subsidiary of the 
Corporation to purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any shares of 
stock of the Corporation unless the Corporation could, under paragraph (A) of 
this Section 4, purchase or otherwise acquire such shares at such time and in 
such manner.

          Section 5.  REACQUIRED SHARES.  Any Units of Series A Preferred 
Stock purchased or otherwise acquired by the Corporation in any manner 
whatsoever shall be 


                                      6
<PAGE>

retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition thereof.  All such Units 
shall, upon their cancellation, become authorized but unissued Units of 
Preferred Stock and may be reissued as part of a new series of Preferred 
Stock to be created by resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors, 
subject to the conditions and restrictions on issuance set forth herein.

     Section 6.  LIQUIDATION, DISSOLUTION OR WINDING UP.  (A)  Upon any 
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the 
Corporation, no distribution shall be made (i) to the holders of shares of 
junior stock unless the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall 
have received, subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided in paragraph 
(B), the greater of either (a) $.01 per Unit plus an amount equal to accrued 
and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, whether or not earned or 
declared, to the date of such payment, or (b) the amount equal to the 
aggregate per share amount to be distributed to holders of shares of Common 
Stock, or (ii) to the holders of shares of parity stock, unless 
simultaneously therewith distributions are made ratably on Units of Series A 
Preferred Stock and all other shares of such parity stock in proportion to 
the total amounts to which the holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock 
are entitled under clause (i)(a) of this sentence and to which the holders of 
shares of such parity stock are entitled, in each case upon such liquidation, 
dissolution or winding up.

     (B)  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the Rights 
Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on outstanding shares of Common 
Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding shares of 
Common Stock, or (iii) combine outstanding shares of Common Stock into a 
smaller number of shares, then in each such case the aggregate amount to 
which holders of Units of Series A Preferred Stock were entitled immediately 
prior to such event pursuant to clause (i)(b) of paragraph (A) of this 
Section 6 shall be adjusted by multiplying such amount by a fraction the 
numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that are 
outstanding immediately after such event and the denominator of which shall 
be the number of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately 
prior to such event.

     Section 7.  CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, ETC.  In case the Corporation shall 
enter into any consolidation, merger, combination or other transaction in 
which the shares of common stock are exchanged for or converted into other 
stock or securities, cash and/or any other property, then in any such case 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall at the same time be similarly 
exchanged for or converted into an amount per Unit (subject to the provision 
for adjustment hereinafter set forth) equal to the aggregate amount of stock, 
securities, cash and/or any other property (payable in kind), as the 


                                      7
<PAGE>

case may be, into which or for which each share of Common Stock is converted 
or exchanged.  In the event the Corporation shall at any time after the 
Rights Declaration Date (i) declare any dividend on outstanding shares of 
Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivide outstanding 
shares of Common Stock, or (iii) combine outstanding Common Stock into a 
smaller number of shares, then in each such case the amount set forth in the 
immediately preceding sentence with respect to the exchange or conversion of 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted by multiplying such 
amount by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of 
Common Stock that are outstanding immediately after such event and the 
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock that were 
outstanding immediately prior to such event.

     Section 8.  REDEMPTION.  The Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall not 
be redeemable.

     Section 9.  RANKING.  The Units of Series A Preferred Stock shall rank 
junior to all other series of the Preferred Stock and to any other class of 
preferred stock that hereafter may be issued by the Corporation as to the 
payment of dividends and the distribution of assets, unless the terms of any 
such series or class shall provide otherwise.

     Section 10.  AMENDMENT.  The Certificate, including, without limitation, 
this resolution, shall not hereafter be amended, either directly or 
indirectly, or through merger or consolidation with another corporations in 
any manner that would alter or change the powers, preferences or special 
rights of the Series A Preferred Stock so as to affect them adversely without 
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or more of the outstanding 
Units of Series A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class.

     Section 11.  FRACTIONAL SHARES.  The Series A Preferred Stock may be 
issued in Units or other fractions of a share, which Units or fractions shall 
entitle the holder, in proportion to such holder's fractional shares, to 
exercise voting rights, receive dividends, participate in distributions and 
to have the benefit of all other rights of holders of Series A Preferred 
Stock.

     Section 12.  CERTAIN DEFINITIONS.  As used herein with respect to the 
Series A Preferred Stock, the following terms shall have the following 
meanings:

     (A)  The term "COMMON STOCK" shall mean the class of stock designated as 
the common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Corporation at the date 
hereof or any other class of stock resulting from successive changes or 
reclassification of such 


                                      8
<PAGE>

common stock.

     (B)  The term "JUNIOR STOCK" (i) as used in Section 4, shall mean the

class or series of stock of the Corporation hereafter authorized or issued 
ranking PARI PASSU with the Series A Preferred Stock as to the payment of 
dividends and (ii) as used in Section 6, shall mean any class or series of

       1.1    ACCOUNTING PERIOD.  An Accounting Period shall be (i) the Fiscal
Year if there are no changes in the Partners' respective interests in the
Profits or Losses of the Partnership during such period except on the first day
thereof, or (ii) any other period beginning on the first day of the Fiscal Year,
or any other day during the Fiscal Year upon which occurs a change in such
respective interests, and ending on the last day of  the Fiscal Year, or on the
day preceding an earlier day upon which any change in such respective interest
shall occur.

       1.2    ADJUSTED ASSET VALUE.  The Adjusted Asset Value with respect to
any asset shall be the asset's adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes,
except as follows:

              (a)    The initial Adjusted Asset Value of any asset contributed
by a Partner to the Partnership shall be the lesser of (i) the gross fair market
value of such asset or (ii) the asset's adjusted basis for federal income tax
purposes at the time of contribution, as determined by the contributing Partner
and the General Partner.

              (b)    In the discretion of the General Partner, the Adjusted
Asset Values of all Partnership assets may be adjusted to equal their respective
gross fair market values, as determined by the General Partner, and the
resulting unrealized profit or loss allocated to the Capital Accounts of the
Partners pursuant to Article 6, as of the following times:  (i) the acquisition
of an additional interest in the Partnership by any new or existing Partner in
exchange for more than a DE MINIMIS capital contribution, and (ii) the
distribution by the Partnership to a Partner of more than a DE MINIMIS amount of
Partnership assets, unless all Partners receive simultaneous distributions of
either undivided interests in the distributed property or identical Partnership
assets in proportion to their interests in Partnership distributions as provided
in paragraphs 8.4 and 8.5.

              (c)    The Adjusted Asset Values of all Partnership assets shall

times:  (i) the termination of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes
pursuant to

described in paragraph 11.1.

       1.3    AFFILIATE.  An Affiliate of any person shall mean any person that
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, or is
controlled by or is under common control with the person specified.

       1.4    CAPITAL ACCOUNT.  The Capital Account of each Partner shall
consist of its original capital contribution (in kind contributions shall be
credited at their Adjusted Asset Value), (i) increased by any additional capital
contributions, its share of income or gain that is allocated to it pursuant to
this Agreement, any Capital Account shift in favor of such Partner, and (ii)
decreased by the amount of any distributions to or withdrawals by it, its share
of expense or loss that is allocated to it pursuant to this Agreement, the
amount of any Capital Account shift away from the Capital Account of such
Partner.  The foregoing provision and the other provisions of this Agreement
relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704 1(b)(2)(iv), and shall, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent
with such Regulations.  In the event the General Partner shall determine that it
is prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or
credits thereto, are computed in order to comply with such Regulations, the
General Partner may make such modification, provided that it is not likely to
have more than an insignificant effect on the total amounts distributable to any
Partner pursuant to Article VIII and Article XI.

       1.5    CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION.  A Partner's Capital Contribution shall mean
the amount that such Partner has contributed to the capital of the Partnership
as set forth opposite such Partner's name on Exhibit A hereto, as from time to

distribution of Securities shall be equal to the excess, if any, of the fair
market value of the Securities distributed (valued as of the date of
distribution in accordance with paragraph 13.1), over the aggregate Adjusted
Asset Value of the Securities distributed.  The Deemed Loss from any in kind
distribution of Securities shall be equal to the excess, if any, of the
aggregate Adjusted Asset Value of the Securities distributed over the fair
market value of the Securities distributed (valued as of the date of
distribution in accordance with paragraph 13.1).

       1.8    EXCLUDED INVESTMENT.  Excluded Investment means a Security of the
Partnership that one or more Partners does not share in because (i) he or she is
an officer, director or five percent or greater shareholder of the issuer of the
Security or (ii) the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors of Adobe

the investment because of the Partner's involvement with the issuer of the

acquisition.

counter or (b) currently the subject of an effective Securities Act 
registration statement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Security shall not 
be deemed to be a Marketable Security if, in the good faith judgment of the 
General Partner, the market on which such Security trades is not adequate to 
permit an orderly sale of all shares of such Security held by the Partnership 
within a reasonable time period or if the Securities cannot be sold because 
of lock-up restrictions or other contractual restrictions on transfer.

separately for each Security for each Accounting Period as of the last day
thereof that is equal to the Partnership's taxable income or loss for each
Security for such Accounting Period, determined in accordance with Section
703(a) of the Code (for this purpose, all items of income, gain, loss, or
deduction required to be stated separately pursuant to Code Section 703(a)(1)
shall be included in taxable income or loss), with the following adjustments:

              (a)    Any income of the Partnership that is exempt from federal
income tax and not otherwise taken into account in computing Profit or Loss
pursuant to this paragraph shall be added to such taxable income or loss;

Section 705(a)(2)(B) or treated as Code Section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditures
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704 1(b)(2)(iv)(i) and not otherwise
taken into account in computing Profit or Loss pursuant to this paragraph shall
be subtracted from such taxable income or loss;

              (c)    Gain or loss resulting from any disposition of a
Partnership asset with respect to which gain or loss is recognized for federal
income tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the Adjusted Asset Value
of the asset disposed of rather than its adjusted tax basis;

              (d)    The difference between the gross fair market value of all
Partnership assets and their respective Adjusted Asset Values shall be added to
such taxable income or loss in the circumstances described in paragraph 1.2;

              (e)    Items which are specially allocated pursuant to paragraph
6.3 hereof shall not be taken into account in computing Profit or Loss; and

computing Profit or Loss; and

              (g)    any unrecognized gain or loss respecting a Security held by

agreements of AVI or AVII shall be added to the Partnership's taxable income or
loss.

nature and rights and options with respect thereto, including stock, notes,

Partner determines another percentage is more appropriate.

shall contribute capital to the Partnership in cash in an amount equal to the
greater of:  (i) one percent (1%) of the amount contributed by the Limited

for investment, and not with a view to the sale or distribution of any part
thereof, and that it has no present intention of selling, granting participation
in, or otherwise distributing the same, and the Limited Partner understands that
its interest in the Partnership has not been registered under the Securities Act
and that any transfer or other disposition of the interest may not be made
without registration under the Securities Act or pursuant to an applicable
exemption therefrom.  Each Limited Partner further represents that it does not

with respect to its interest in the Partnership.

agents and save and hold them harmless, from and in respect to all (i) fees,
costs and expenses in connection with or resulting from any laim, action, or
demand against the tax matters partner, the General Partner or the Partnership
that arise out of or in any way relate to the tax matters partner's status as

demands and any losses or damages therefrom, including amounts paid in

                                     ARTICLE 13
                                          
                                     VALUATION

       13.1   VALUATION.  Subject to the specific standards set forth below, the
valuation of Securities and other assets and liabilities under this Agreement
shall be at fair market value.  Except as may be required under applicable
Treasury Regulations, no value shall be placed on the goodwill or the name of
the Partnership in determining the value of the interest of any Partner or in
any accounting among the Partners.

              (a)    The following criteria shall be used for determining the
fair market value of Securities:

                     (i)    Securities not subject to investment letter or other
similar restrictions on free Marketability:

                            (1)    If traded on one or more securities exchanges
or the Nasdaq National Market, the value shall be deemed to be the Securities'
highest closing price on such exchange(s) on the valuation date.

                            (2)    If actively traded over the counter (other
than on the Nasdaq National Market), the value shall be deemed to be the average
of the closing bid and ask prices of such Securities on the valuation date.

                            (3)    If there is no active public market, the
value shall be the fair market value thereof, as determined by the General
Partner, taking into consideration the purchase price of the Securities,
developments concerning the investee company subsequent to the acquisition of
the Securities, any financial data and projections of the investee company
provided to the General Partner, and such other factor or factors as the General
Partner may deem relevant.  If a Majority in Interest of the Class A Limited
Partners objects to the valuation of any Nonmarketable Security within fifteen
(15) days of receipt of the valuation, the fair market value of such Security
shall be determined by an appraiser selected by the senior ranking officer of
the Western Association of Venture Capitalists (or any successor organization)
who is not associated with any of the Partners.  The Partnership shall bear the
expense of any such appraisal.

                     (ii)   Securities subject to investment letter or other
restrictions on free Marketability shall be valued by making an appropriate
adjustment from the value determined under (1), (2), or (3) above to reflect the
effect of the restrictions on transfer.

                     (iii)  The valuation of the Partnership's interest in AVII
shall be based on the valuation of the securities owned by AVII determined in
accordance with AVII's limited partnership agreement.

                                       18.
<PAGE>

              (b)    If the General Partner in good faith determines that,
because of special circumstances, the valuation methods set forth in this
paragraph do not fairly determine the value of a Security, the General Partner
shall make such adjustments or use such alternative valuation method as it deems
appropriate.


                                     ARTICLE 14
                                          
                                  OTHER PROVISIONS

required by law, no Limited Partner shall be bound by, nor be personally liable

its capital commitment to the Partnership.

       14.3   EXCULPATION.  Neither the General Partner, nor its members or
Affiliates shall be liable to any Limited Partner or the Partnership for honest
mistakes of judgment, or for action or inaction, taken in good faith for a
purpose that was reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the
Partnership, or for losses due to such mistakes, action, or inaction, or to the
negligence, dishonesty, or bad faith of any employee, broker, or other agent of
the Partnership, provided that such employee, broker, or agent was selected,
engaged, or retained with reasonable care.  The General Partner and such persons
may consult with counsel and accountants in respect of Partnership affairs and
be fully protected and justified in any action or inaction that is taken in
accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel or accountants, provided
that they shall have been selected with reasonable care. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing to the contrary, the provisions of this paragraph and the
immediately following paragraph shall not be construed so as to relieve (or
attempt to relieve) any person of any liability by reason of fraud, willful
misconduct or gross negligence or to the extent (but only to the extent) that
such liability may not be waived, modified, or limited under applicable law, but
shall be construed so as to effectuate the provisions of such paragraphs to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

       14.4   INDEMNIFICATION.  The Partnership agrees to indemnify, out of the
assets of the Partnership only, the General Partner and its members and their
agents (the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent permitted by law and to
save and hold them harmless from and in respect of all (a) reasonable fees,
costs, and expenses, including legal fees, paid in connection with or resulting
from any claim, action, or demand against any Indemnified Party that arises out
of or in any way relate to the Partnership, its properties, business, or affairs
and (b) such claims, actions, and demands and any losses or damages resulting
from such claims, actions, and demands, including amounts paid in settlement or
compromise (if recommended by attorneys for the Partnership) of any such claim,
action or demand; provided, however, that this indemnity shall not extend to
conduct not undertaken in good faith to promote the best interests of the
Partnership or the portfolio companies of the Partnership, nor to any conduct
which constitutes fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence.  Expenses
incurred by any Indemnified Party in defending a claim or proceeding covered by
this paragraph shall be paid by the Partnership in advance of the final
disposition of such claim or proceeding provided the indemnified person
undertakes to repay such amount if it is ultimately determined that such person
was not entitled to be indemnified.  The provisions of this paragraph 14.4 shall
remain in effect as to each Indemnified

                                       19.
<PAGE>

Party whether or not such Indemnified Party continues to serve in the 
capacity that entitled such person to be indemnified.

of employment with the Company that are inconsistent with any such press 
releases.

           (e)  CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE RESIGNATION AGREEMENT.  Subject to any 
legal requirements to divulge such information, you and the Company mutually

whole or in part on age discrimination.

           (c)  You acknowledge that you have read Section 1542 of the Civil 
Code of the State of California, which states:

               "A general release does not extend to claims which the 
               creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the 
               time of executing the release, which if known by him must have 
               materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

You waive any rights that you have or may have under Section 1542 of the 
Civil Code to the full extent that you may lawfully waive such rights with 
respect to this general release of all claims.

     10.  TERMINATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS.  With the

and an authorized officer of the Company.

     11.  ARBITRATION.  Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating 
to this Resignation Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim

Company (collectively, the "PARTIES") shall be settled by arbitration in San 
Jose, California, before a panel of three arbitrators, one to be selected by 
the Company, one by you and the other by the two persons so selected, all in 
accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in 
effect; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall nevertheless be entitled to 
seek relief under Section 8 above in accordance with Section 8(g) thereof.  
In consideration of the Parties' agreement 

<PAGE>

to submit to arbitration disputes with regard to this Resignation Agreement 
and with regard to any alleged tort, contract or other claim arising out of 
the employment relationship, and in consideration of the anticipated 
expedition and minimization of expense of this arbitration remedy, each Party 
agrees that the arbitration provisions of this Resignation Agreement shall 
provide it with the exclusive remedy, except as provided in the preceding 
sentence, and each Party expressly waives any right it might have to seek 
redress in any other form except as provided herein.  The Parties further 
agree that the arbitrators acting hereunder shall be empowered to assess no 
remedy other than payment of compensatory damages or an order (including 
temporary, preliminary or permanent injunctive relief) enforcing the 
provisions of Section 8 above.  Any decision or order of the majority of 
arbitrators shall be binding upon the Parties hereto and judgment thereon may 
be entered in the Santa Clara County Superior Court or any other court having 
jurisdiction.  The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the 
losing party its attorneys' fees and costs incurred in any lawsuit or other 
action brought to enforce any right arising out of this Resignation Agreement.

accordance with the terms set forth below.

Agreement to the Company.  The Revocation Period shall expire at 5:00 p.m. 
(California time) on the last day of the Revocation Period; PROVIDED, 
HOWEVER, that if such seventh day is not a business day, the Revocation 
Period shall extend to 5:00 p.m. on the next succeeding business day. In the

<PAGE>

revocation by you, all obligations of any of the Companies under this 
Resignation Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect

effective unless it is in writing and signed by you and received by the 
Company prior to the expiration of the Revocation Period

     Your signature on the line below constitutes your agreement with each

                              ADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED

                                                                [GOLD VERSION A]


                                                              ________ ___, 1997

[Address]

                                RETENTION AGREEMENT


Dear _______: 

            Adobe Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"),
considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "BOARD") recognizes that the uncertainty and
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change in
control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.  

            The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps should
be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of
members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, including
yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of
potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in control
of the Company.  

            In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, the
Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement (this "AGREEMENT")
which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in the event of a
change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which are not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words in Section 7 of
this Agreement.  

            1.     TERM OF EMPLOYMENT UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  The term of your
employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control Date and
shall continue until the second anniversary of the Change in Control Date (the
"TERM").  

            2.     EMPLOYMENT DURING THE TERM.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company: 

<PAGE>

                                       2

            (a)    TITLES; REPORTING AND DUTIES.  Your position, titles, nature
and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no less
favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the Change in
Control Date.  

            (b)    SALARY AND BONUS.   Your base salary and annual bonus
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to
other similarly situated executives of the Company.  

            (c)    INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  You shall be eligible to participate
in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by the Company for
its executive employees at your level of seniority (excluding the Investment
Partnership, except to the extent you hold Restricted Units) in accordance with
the terms and provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent
with the Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control
Date.  

            (d)    BENEFITS.  You shall be eligible to participate in all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company
provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of such plans
and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, in the aggregate,
than the terms and provisions available to other executive employees of the
Company.  

            (e)    LOCATION.  You will continue to be employed at a business
location in the same metropolitan area in which you were employed prior to the
Change in Control Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel
for business purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the
amount of business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date.  

            3.     INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION DURING THE TERM.

            (a)    CASH SEVERANCE PAYMENT.  In the event of your Involuntary
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within five (5) days of
the date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but
unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the
time of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis
of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you within
five (5) days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual bonus
for the year in which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated on the
basis of your target bonus for that year and on the assumption that all
performance targets have been or will be achieved.   In addition, the Company
shall pay you in a cash lump sum, within eight (8) days following the date of
your execution of the release described in the last sentence of this Section
3(a) (or on

<PAGE>

                                       3

the Date of Termination, if later), an amount (the "SEVERANCE PAYMENT") equal 
to the product of (i) the sum of your Reference Salary and your Reference 
Bonus, multiplied by (ii) two (2) plus one twelfth (1/12th) for each of your 
completed years of service with the Company (not in excess of twelve (12)) 
(the number determined in accordance with the clause (ii) being hereinafter 
referred to as the "SEVERANCE MULTIPLE").  The Severance Payment shall be in 
lieu of any other cash severance payments which you are entitled to receive 
under any other severance pay plan or arrangement sponsored by the Company 
and its subsidiaries.

            (b)    VESTING AND EXERCISE OF EQUITY AWARDS AND RESTRICTED UNITS. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in an applicable Equity Award
or Restricted Unit agreement, all Equity Awards granted to you under the Equity
Plans (except performance share unit awards, which shall continue to be governed
by their current terms) shall vest in full and become exercisable, and all
Restricted Units granted to you under the Investment Partnership shall vest in
full, upon your Involuntary Termination during the Term.  Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and
exercisability provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity
Awards or Restricted Units be less favorable to you than the terms and
provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof.
 
            (c)    BENEFITS CONTINUATION.  In the event of your Involuntary
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall continue to
be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation Period (as
hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe
benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you immediately prior to your
Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions (including the level of
your contributions) in effect for you and your dependents immediately prior to
such Involuntary Termination.  For purposes of the previous sentence, "BENEFIT
CONTINUATION PERIOD" means the period beginning on the Date of Termination and
continuing for a number of years (and fractions of years) equal to the Severance
Multiple.

            (d)    DATE AND NOTICE OF TERMINATION.  Any termination of your
employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be communicated by a
notice of termination to the other party hereto (the "NOTICE OF TERMINATION"). 
The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in
this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your employment
under the provision so indicated.  The date of your termination of employment
with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "DATE OF TERMINATION") shall be
determined as follows:  (i) if your employment is terminated for Disability,
thirty (30) days after a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall
not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such thirty
(30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by the Company in an
Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date the Notice of Termination
is received by you and (iii) if your employment is terminated by the Company for
Cause, the

<PAGE>

                                       4

later of the date specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10) days 
following the date such notice is received by you.  If the basis of your 
Involuntary Termination is your resignation for Good Reason, the Date of 
Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date your Notice of Termination 
is received by the Company.  The Date of Termination for a resignation of 
employment other than for Good Reason shall be the date set forth in the 
applicable notice, which shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the 
date such notice is received by the Company.  

            (e)    NO MITIGATION OR OFFSET.  You shall not be required to
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as
the result of employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise.  

            4.     LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS.  In the event that it is determined
by the Accounting Firm that any amount payable to you under this Agreement,
alone or when aggregated with any other amount payable or benefit provided to
you pursuant to any other plan or arrangement of the Company, would constitute
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
then the aggregate present value of all such payments and benefits shall be
reduced to the amount, expressed as a present value, which, as determined by the
Accounting Firm, maximizes the aggregate present value of the payments without
causing any payment to be nondeductible by the Company under Section 280G of the
Code. 

            5.     LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
you for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and
reasonable legal fees and expenses which reflect common practice with respect to
the matters involved) incurred by you as a result of any claim, action or
proceeding (i) arising out of your termination of employment during the Term,
(ii) contesting, disputing or enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under
this Agreement or (iii) arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability
or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision thereof.  The payments or
reimbursements provided for herein shall be paid by the Company promptly (but in
no event more than five (5) business days) following receipt of a written
request for payment or reimbursement, as the case may be.

            6.     SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.

            (a)    ASSUMPTION BY SUCCESSOR.  The Company will require any
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Company would be

<PAGE>

                                       5

required to perform it if no such succession had taken place; PROVIDED, 
HOWEVER, that no such assumption shall relieve the Company of its obligations 
hereunder.  As used in this Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company 
as hereinbefore defined and any successor to its business and/or assets as 
aforesaid which assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement by operation of 
law or otherwise.  

            (b)    ENFORCEABILITY; BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal representatives
and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger,
consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you
should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had
continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be
paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or
other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.  

            7.     DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

            "ACCOUNTING FIRM" shall mean KPMG Peat Marwick LLP or, if such firm
is unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, such other national
accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement between you and the Company.

            "CAUSE" shall mean a termination of your employment during the Term
which is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii) your willful disclosure of
material trade secrets or other material confidential information related to the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries or (iii) your willful and continued
failure substantially to perform your same duties with the Company as in
existence prior to the Change in Control (other than any such failure resulting
from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any actual or
anticipated failure resulting from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a
written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board,
which demand identifies the specific actions which the Board believes constitute
willful and continued failure substantially to perform your duties, and which
performance is not substantially corrected by you within ten (10) days of
receipt of such demand.  For purposes of the previous sentence, no act or
failure to act on your part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to
be done, by you with willful malfeasance or gross negligence and without
reasonable belief that your action or omission was not materially adverse to the
best interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
<PAGE>

                                       6

not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at 
a meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable 
notice to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be 
heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board 
you were guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of 
the first sentence of this section and specifying the particulars thereof in 
detail.

             "CHANGE IN CONTROL" shall mean a change in control of the Company
of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of
Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether or
not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, a
Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:
  
            (i)    any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the
     Exchange Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
     13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or
     more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
     securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company;
  
            (ii)   during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including
     any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at
     the beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new directors,
     whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's
     stockholders was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) of
     the directors then still in office who either were directors at the
     beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was
     previously so approved (the "INCUMBENT DIRECTORS"), cease for any reason to
     constitute a majority thereof;
  
            (iii)  there occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or other
     corporate transaction involving the Company or a subsidiary of the Company
     (a "TRANSACTION"), in each case with respect to which the stockholders of
     the Company immediately prior to such Transaction do not, immediately after
     the Transaction, own securities representing more than 50% of the combined
     voting power of the Company, a parent of the Company or other corporation
     resulting from such Transaction (counting, for this purpose, only those
     securities held by the Company's stockholders immediately after the
     Transaction that were received in exchange for, or represent their
     continuing ownership of, securities of the Company held by them immediately
     prior to the Transaction);
<PAGE>

                                       7

            (iv)   all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are
     sold, liquidated or distributed; or

            (v)    there is a "change in control" or a "change in the effective
     control" of the Company within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and
     the Regulations.
  
            "CHANGE IN CONTROL DATE" shall mean the date on which the Change in
Control occurs.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this definition, if your
employment with the Company terminates prior to the Change in Control Date and
it is reasonably demonstrated that your termination of employment (i) was at the
request of the third party who has taken steps reasonably calculated to effect
the Change in Control or (ii) otherwise arose in connection with or in
anticipation of the Change in Control, then "Change in Control Date" shall mean
the date immediately prior to the date of your termination of employment.

            "CODE" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
any successor provisions thereto.

            "COMMON STOCK" shall mean the common stock of the Company.

            "DISABILITY" shall mean (i) your incapacity due to physical or
mental illness which causes you to be absent from the full-time performance of
your duties with the Company for six (6) consecutive months and (ii) your
failure to return to full-time performance of your duties for the Company within
thirty (30) days after written Notice of Termination due to Disability is given
to you.  Any question as to the existence of your Disability upon which you and
the Company cannot agree shall be determined by a qualified independent
physician selected by you (or, if you are unable to make such selection, such
selection shall be made by any adult member of your immediate family), and
approved by the Company.  The determination of such physician made in writing to

                                RETENTION AGREEMENT


Dear _______: 

            Adobe Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"),
considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "BOARD") recognizes that the uncertainty and
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change in
control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.  

            The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps should
be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of
members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, including
yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of
potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in control
of the Company.  

            In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, the
Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement (this "AGREEMENT")
which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in the event of a
change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which are not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words in Section 7 of
this Agreement.  

            1.     TERM OF EMPLOYMENT UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  The term of your
employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control Date and
shall continue until the second anniversary of the Change in Control Date (the
"TERM").  

            2.     EMPLOYMENT DURING THE TERM.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company: 

            (a)    TITLES; REPORTING AND DUTIES.  Your position, titles, nature
and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no less
favorable to you than those that you
<PAGE>

enjoyed immediately prior to the Change in Control Date.  

            (b)    SALARY AND BONUS.   Your base salary and annual bonus
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to
other similarly situated executives of the Company.  

            (c)    INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  You shall be eligible to participate
in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by the Company for
its executive employees at your level of seniority (excluding the Investment
Partnership, except to the extent you hold Restricted Units) in accordance with
the terms and provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent
with the Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control
Date.  

            (d)    BENEFITS.  You shall be eligible to participate in all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company
provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of such plans
and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, in the aggregate,
than the terms and provisions available to other executive employees of the
Company.  

            (e)    LOCATION.  You will continue to be employed at a business
location in the same metropolitan area in which you were employed prior to the
Change in Control Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel
for business purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the
amount of business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date.  

            3.     INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION DURING THE TERM.

            (a)    CASH SEVERANCE PAYMENT.  In the event of your Involuntary
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within five (5) days of
the date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but
unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the
time of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis
of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you within
five (5) days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual bonus
for the year in which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated on the
basis of your target bonus for that year and on the assumption that all
performance targets have been or will be achieved.   In addition, the Company
shall pay you in a cash lump sum, within eight (8) days following the date of
your execution of the release described in the last sentence of this Section
3(a) (or on the Date of Termination, if later), an amount (the "SEVERANCE
PAYMENT") equal to the product of (i) the sum of your Reference Salary and your
Reference Bonus, multiplied by (ii) two (2) plus one twelfth (1/12th) for each
of your completed years of service with the Company (not in excess of twelve
(12)) (the number determined in accordance with the clause (ii) being

<PAGE>

hereinafter referred to as the "SEVERANCE MULTIPLE").  The Severance Payment
shall be in lieu of any other cash severance payments which you are entitled to
receive under any other severance pay plan or arrangement sponsored by the
Company and its subsidiaries.

            (b)    VESTING AND EXERCISE OF EQUITY AWARDS AND RESTRICTED UNITS. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in an applicable Equity Award
or Restricted Unit agreement, all Equity Awards granted to you under the Equity
Plans (except performance share unit awards, which shall continue to be governed
by their current terms) shall vest in full and become exercisable, and all
Restricted Units granted to you under the Investment Partnership shall vest in
full, upon your Involuntary Termination during the Term.  Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and
exercisability provisions applicable to you under the terms of your Equity
Awards or Restricted Units be less favorable to you than the terms and
provisions of such awards in effect on the date hereof.
 
            (c)    BENEFITS CONTINUATION.  In the event of your Involuntary
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall continue to
be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation Period (as
hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe
benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you immediately prior to your
Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions (including the level of
your contributions) in effect for you and your dependents immediately prior to
such Involuntary Termination.  For purposes of the previous sentence, "BENEFIT
CONTINUATION PERIOD" means the period beginning on the Date of Termination and
continuing for a number of years (and fractions of years) equal to the Severance
Multiple.

            (d)    DATE AND NOTICE OF TERMINATION.  Any termination of your
employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be communicated by a
notice of termination to the other party hereto (the "NOTICE OF TERMINATION"). 
The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in
this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your employment
under the provision so indicated.  The date of your termination of employment
with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "DATE OF TERMINATION") shall be
determined as follows:  (i) if your employment is terminated for Disability,
thirty (30) days after a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall
not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such thirty
(30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by the Company in an
Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date the Notice of Termination
is received by you and (iii) if your employment is terminated by the Company for
Cause, the later of the date specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10)
days following the date such notice is received by you.  If the basis of your
Involuntary Termination is your resignation for Good Reason, the Date of
Termination shall be ten (10) days after the date your Notice of Termination is
received by the Company.  The Date of Termination for a resignation of
employment other than for Good Reason shall be the date set forth in the
applicable notice, which shall be no earlier than ten (10) days after the date
such notice is received by the

<PAGE>

Company.  

            (e)    NO MITIGATION OR OFFSET.  You shall not be required to
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as
the result of employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise.  

            4.     LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS.  In the event that it is determined
by the Accounting Firm that any amount payable to you under this Agreement,
alone or when aggregated with any other amount payable or benefit provided to
you pursuant to any other plan or arrangement of the Company, would constitute
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
then the aggregate present value of all such payments and benefits shall be
reduced to the amount, expressed as a present value, which, as determined by the
Accounting Firm, maximizes the aggregate present value of the payments without
causing any payment to be nondeductible by the Company under Section 280G of the
Code. 

            5.     LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
you for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and
reasonable legal fees and expenses which reflect common practice with respect to
the matters involved) incurred by you as a result of any claim, action or
proceeding (i) arising out of your termination of employment during the Term,
(ii) contesting, disputing or enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under
this Agreement or (iii) arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability
or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision thereof.  The payments or
reimbursements provided for herein shall be paid by the Company promptly (but in
no event more than five (5) business days) following receipt of a written
request for payment or reimbursement, as the case may be.

            6.     SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.

            (a)    ASSUMPTION BY SUCCESSOR.  The Company will require any
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no
such succession had taken place; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such assumption
shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this
Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to
perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.  

            (b)    ENFORCEABILITY; BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal representatives
and heirs) and the Company and

<PAGE>

any organization which succeeds to substantially all of the business or 
assets of the Company, whether by means of merger, consolidation, acquisition 
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or otherwise, 
including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in Control or by 
operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be 
enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors, 
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If 
you should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if 
you had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided 
herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your 
devisee, legatee or other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your 
estate.  

            7.     DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

            "ACCOUNTING FIRM" shall mean KPMG Peat Marwick LLP or, if such firm
is unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, such other national
accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement between you and the Company.

            "CAUSE" shall mean a termination of your employment during the Term
which is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii) your willful disclosure of
material trade secrets or other material confidential information related to the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries or (iii) your willful and continued
failure substantially to perform your same duties with the Company as in
existence prior to the Change in Control (other than any such failure resulting
from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness or any actual or
anticipated failure resulting from a resignation by you for Good Reason) after a
written demand for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board,
which demand identifies the specific actions which the Board believes constitute
willful and continued failure substantially to perform your duties, and which
performance is not substantially corrected by you within ten (10) days of
receipt of such demand.  For purposes of the previous sentence, no act or
failure to act on your part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to
be done, by you with willful malfeasance or gross negligence and without
reasonable belief that your action or omission was not materially adverse to the
best interest of the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be
deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been
delivered to you a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of
not less than three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a
meeting of the Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice
to you and an opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard
before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were
guilty of conduct set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first
sentence of this section and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

             "CHANGE IN CONTROL" shall mean a change in control of the Company
of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of
Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act, whether or
not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary 

<PAGE>

notwithstanding, a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:
  
            (i)    any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the
     Exchange Act, is or becomes the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule
     13d-3 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act),
     directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing 30% or
     more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding
     securities entitled to vote in the election of directors of the Company;
  
            (ii)   during any period of two (2) consecutive years (not including
     any period prior to the execution of this Agreement), individuals who at
     the beginning of such period constituted the Board and any new directors,
     whose election by the Board or nomination for election by the Company's
     stockholders was approved by a vote of at least three-fourths (3/4ths) of
     the directors then still in office who either were directors at the
     beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was
     previously so approved (the "INCUMBENT DIRECTORS"), cease for any reason to
     constitute a majority thereof;

     the Transaction, own securities representing more than 50% of the combined
     voting power of the Company, a parent of the Company or other corporation
     resulting from such Transaction (counting, for this purpose, only those

                                                              [PLATINUM VERSION]


                                                              ________ ___, 1997

                                RETENTION AGREEMENT


Dear _______: 

            Adobe Systems Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"),
considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to take
reasonable steps to retain key management personnel.  Further, the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "BOARD") recognizes that the uncertainty and
questions which might arise among management in the context of a change in
control of the Company could result in the departure or distraction of
management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders.  

            The Board has determined, therefore, that appropriate steps should
be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of
members of the management of the Company and its subsidiaries, including
yourself, to their assigned duties without distraction in the face of
potentially disturbing circumstances arising from any possible change in control
of the Company.  

            In order to induce you to remain in the employ of the Company, the
Company has determined to enter into this letter agreement (this "AGREEMENT")
which addresses the terms and conditions of your employment in the event of a
change in control of the Company.  Capitalized words which are not otherwise
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such words in Section 7 of
this Agreement.  

            1.     TERM OF EMPLOYMENT UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  The term of your
employment under this Agreement shall commence on the Change in Control Date and
shall continue until the second anniversary of the Change in Control Date (the
"TERM").  

            2.     EMPLOYMENT DURING THE TERM.  During the Term, the following
terms and conditions shall apply to your employment with the Company: 
<PAGE>

                                       2

            (a)    TITLES; REPORTING AND DUTIES.  Your position, titles, nature
and status of responsibilities and reporting obligations shall be no less
favorable to you than those that you enjoyed immediately prior to the Change in
Control Date.  

            (b)    SALARY AND BONUS.   Your base salary and annual bonus
opportunity may not be reduced, and your base salary shall be periodically
reviewed and increased in the manner commensurate with increases awarded to
other similarly situated executives of the Company.  

            (c)    INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  You shall be eligible to participate
in each long-term incentive plan or arrangement established by the Company for
its executive employees at your level of seniority in accordance with the terms
and provisions of such plan or arrangement and at a level consistent with the
Company's practices applicable to you prior to the Change in Control Date.  

            (d)    BENEFITS.  You shall be eligible to participate in all
pension, welfare and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that the Company
provides to its executive employees in accordance with the terms of such plans
and arrangements, which shall be no less favorable to you, in the aggregate,
than the terms and provisions available to other executive employees of the
Company.  

            (e)    LOCATION.  You will continue to be employed at a business
location in the same metropolitan area in which you were employed prior to the
Change in Control Date and the amount of time that you are required to travel
for business purposes will not be increased in any significant respect from the
amount of business travel required of you prior to the Change in Control Date.  

            3.     INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION DURING THE TERM.

            (a)    CASH SEVERANCE PAYMENT.  In the event of your Involuntary
Termination during the Term, the Company shall pay you within five (5) days of
the date of such Involuntary Termination the full amount of any earned but
unpaid base salary through the Date of Termination at the rate in effect at the
time of the Notice of Termination, plus a cash payment (calculated on the basis
of your Reference Salary) for all unused vacation time which you may have
accrued as of the Date of Termination.  The Company shall also pay you within
five (5) days of the Date of Termination a pro rata portion of the annual bonus
for the year in which your Involuntary Termination occurs, calculated on the
basis of your target bonus for that year and on the assumption that all
performance targets have been or will be achieved.   In addition, the Company
shall pay you in a cash lump sum, within eight (8) days following the date of
your execution of the release described in the last sentence of this Section
3(a) (or on the Date of Termination, if later), an amount (the "SEVERANCE
PAYMENT") equal to the product

<PAGE>

                                       3

of (i) the sum of your Reference Salary and your Reference Bonus, multiplied 
by (ii) two (2) plus one twelfth (1/12th) for each of your completed years of 
service with the Company (not in excess of twelve (12)) (the number 
determined in accordance with this clause (ii) being hereinafter referred to 
as the "SEVERANCE MULTIPLE").  The Severance Payment shall be in lieu of any 
other cash severance payments which you are entitled to receive under any 
other severance pay plan or arrangement sponsored by the Company and its 
subsidiaries.

            (b)    VESTING AND EXERCISE OF EQUITY AWARDS AND RESTRICTED UNITS. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in an applicable Equity Award
or Restricted Unit agreement, all Equity Awards granted to you under the Equity
Plans (except performance share unit awards, which shall continue to be governed
by their current terms) shall vest in full and become exercisable, and all
Restricted Units granted to you under the Investment Partnership shall vest in
full, on the Change in Control Date.  Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall the vesting and exercisability provisions
applicable to you under the terms of your Equity Awards or Restricted Units be
less favorable to you than the terms and provisions of such awards in effect on
the date hereof.
 
            (c)    BENEFITS CONTINUATION.  In the event of your Involuntary
Termination during the Term, you and your eligible dependents shall continue to
be eligible to participate during the Benefit Continuation Period (as
hereinafter defined) in the medical, dental, health, life and other fringe
benefit plans and arrangements applicable to you immediately prior to your
Involuntary Termination on the same terms and conditions (including the level of
your contributions) in effect for you and your dependents immediately prior to
such Involuntary Termination.  For purposes of the previous sentence, "BENEFIT
CONTINUATION PERIOD" means the period beginning on the Date of Termination and
continuing for a number of years (and fractions of years) equal to the Severance
Multiple.

            (d)    DATE AND NOTICE OF TERMINATION.  Any termination of your
employment by the Company or by you during the Term shall be communicated by a
notice of termination to the other party hereto (the "NOTICE OF TERMINATION"). 
The Notice of Termination shall indicate the specific termination provision in
this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts
and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of your employment
under the provision so indicated.  The date of your termination of employment
with the Company and its subsidiaries (the "DATE OF TERMINATION") shall be
determined as follows:  (i) if your employment is terminated for Disability,
thirty (30) days after a Notice of Termination is given (provided that you shall
not have returned to the full-time performance of your duties during such thirty
(30) day period), (ii) if your employment is terminated by the Company in an
Involuntary Termination, five (5) days after the date the Notice of Termination
is received by you and (iii) if your employment is terminated by the Company for
Cause, the later of the date specified in the Notice of Termination or ten (10)
days following the date such notice is received by you.  The Date of Termination
for a resignation of employment shall be
<PAGE>

                                       4

the date set forth in the applicable notice, which shall be no earlier than 
ten (10) days after the date such notice is received by the Company.  

            (e)    NO MITIGATION OR OFFSET.  You shall not be required to
mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking
other employment or otherwise, nor shall the amount of any payment or benefit
provided for in this Agreement be reduced by any compensation earned by you as
the result of employment by another employer or by pension benefits paid by the
Company or another employer after the Date of Termination or otherwise.  

            4.     LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS.  In the event that it is determined
by the Accounting Firm that any amount payable to you under this Agreement,
alone or when aggregated with any other amount payable or benefit provided to
you pursuant to any other plan or arrangement of the Company, would constitute
an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
then the aggregate present value of all such payments and benefits shall be
reduced to the amount, expressed as a present value, which, as determined by the
Accounting Firm, maximizes the aggregate present value of the payments without
causing any payment to be nondeductible by the Company under Section 280G of the
Code. 

            5.     LEGAL FEES AND EXPENSES.  The Company shall pay or reimburse
you for all costs and expenses (including, without limitation, court costs and
reasonable legal fees and expenses which reflect common practice with respect to
the matters involved) incurred by you as a result of any claim, action or
proceeding (i) arising out of your termination of employment during the Term,
(ii) contesting, disputing or enforcing any right, benefits or obligations under
this Agreement or (iii) arising out of or challenging the validity, advisability
or enforceability of this Agreement or any provision thereof.  The payments or
reimbursements provided for herein shall be paid by the Company promptly (but in
no event more than five (5) business days) following receipt of a written
request for payment or reimbursement, as the case may be.

            6.     SUCCESSORS; BINDING AGREEMENT.

            (a)    ASSUMPTION BY SUCCESSOR.  The Company will require any
successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or
otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company
expressly to assume and to agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner
and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no
such succession had taken place; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such assumption
shall relieve the Company of its obligations hereunder.  As used in this
Agreement, the "Company" shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any
successor to its business and/or assets as aforesaid which assumes and agrees to
perform this Agreement by operation of law or otherwise.  

<PAGE>

                                       5

            (b)    ENFORCEABILITY; BENEFICIARIES.  This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of you (and your personal representatives
and heirs) and the Company and any organization which succeeds to substantially
all of the business or assets of the Company, whether by means of merger,
consolidation, acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or otherwise, including, without limitation, as a result of a Change in
Control or by operation of law.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be enforceable by your personal or legal representatives, executors,
administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If you
should die while any amount would still be payable to you hereunder if you had
continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be
paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to your devisee, legatee or
other designee or, if there is no such designee, to your estate.  

            7.     DEFINITIONS.  For purposes of this Agreement, the following
capitalized words shall have the meanings set forth below:

            "ACCOUNTING FIRM" shall mean KPMG Peat Marwick LLP or, if such firm
is unable or unwilling to perform such calculations, such other national
accounting firm as shall be designated by agreement between you and the Company.

            "CAUSE" shall mean a termination of your employment during the Term
which is a result of (i) your felony conviction, (ii) your willful disclosure of
material trade secrets or other material confidential information related to the
business of the Company and its subsidiaries or (iii) your willful and continued
failure substantially to perform your same duties with the Company as in
existence prior to the Change in Control (other than any such failure resulting
from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness) after a written demand
for substantial performance is delivered to you by the Board, which demand
identifies the specific actions which the Board believes constitute willful and
continued failure substantially to perform your duties, and which performance is
not substantially corrected by you within ten (10) days of receipt of such
demand.  For purposes of the previous sentence, no act or failure to act on your
part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by you with
willful malfeasance or gross negligence and without reasonable belief that your
action or omission was not materially adverse to the best interest of the
Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you shall not be deemed to have been
terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to you a
copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than
three-fourths (3/4ths) of the entire membership of the Board at a meeting of the
Board called and held for such purpose (after reasonable notice to you and an
opportunity for you, together with your counsel, to be heard before the Board),
finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board you were guilty of conduct
set forth above in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first sentence of this
section and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.

of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of

not the Company is then subject to such reporting requirement; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that, anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, a
Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred if:
  
            (i)    any individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association,
     trust, unincorporated organization or other entity or person, or any
     syndicate or group deemed to be a person under Section 14(d)(2) of the

            (a)    AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS, ETC.  No provision of this Agreement may
be modified, waived or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge
is agreed to in writing.  No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any
breach by the other party hereto of, or compliance with, any condition or
provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed
a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any
prior or subsequent time.  No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise,
express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by
either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement and this
Agreement shall supersede all prior agreements, negotiations, correspondence,
undertakings and communications of the parties, oral or written, with respect to
the subject matter hereof, including, without limitation, the prior Severance
and Change of Control Agreement between you and the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that, except as expressly set forth herein, this Agreement shall not supersede
the terms of Equity Awards or Restricted Units previously granted to you.  

            (b)    VALIDITY.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and
effect.  

            (c)    COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.  

            (d)    NO CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.  Nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed as giving you any right to be retained in the employ of the Company
or shall affect the terms and conditions of your employment with the Company

separate fund shall be established, and no other segregation of assets made, to
assure payment.  To the extent that any person acquires a right to receive
payments from the Company hereunder, such right shall be no greater than the
right of an unsecured creditor of the Company.

intended solely for convenience of reference and shall not affect the rights of
the parties to this Agreement.
