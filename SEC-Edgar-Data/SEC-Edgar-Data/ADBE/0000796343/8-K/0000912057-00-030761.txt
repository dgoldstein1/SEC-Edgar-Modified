5. Other Events. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
July&nbsp;1, 2000, the Company amended its Rights Agreement, dated as of July&nbsp;11, 1990, as amended by the Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of
April&nbsp;30, 1996 (the "First Amended and Restated Rights Agreement"), by the Second Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of July&nbsp;30, 1997 (the "Second Amended and Restated
Rights Agreement") and by the Third Amended and Restated Rights Agreement (the "Third Amended and Restated Rights Agreement"), dated as of December&nbsp;15, 1998, by entering into the Fourth Amended
and Restated Rights Agreement (the "Fourth Amended and Restated Rights Agreement"), dated as of July&nbsp;1, 2000 with Computershare Investor Services, LLC. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Fourth Amended and Restated Rights Agreement that is attached hereto as an exhibit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
general, the Third Amended and Restated Rights Agreement has been amended principally as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;to
extend the Final Expiration Date of the Fourth Amended and Restated Rights Agreement to July&nbsp;23, 2010; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;to
reset the Purchase Price of the Rights; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;to
reset the number of Rights per share of Company Common Stock to one; and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;to
appoint Computershare Investor Services, LLC as the new Rights Agent. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Fourth Amended and Restated Rights Agreement was adopted in the normal course of updating and extending the predecessor shareholder rights plan which was scheduled to expire on
July&nbsp;23, 2000. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
copy of the Fourth Amended and Restated Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the changes to the
Third Amended and Restated Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Fourth Amended Restated Rights Agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company on July&nbsp;11, 1990 (i)&nbsp;announced that it authorized the issuance and declared a dividend of one
right ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Right</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") (as such number may be adjusted pursuant hereto) for each share of the common stock, par value $.0001 per share, of the Company
("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Common Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") outstanding as of the Close of Business (as defined herein) on July&nbsp;24, 1990 (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Record
Date</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), each Right initially representing the right to purchase one share of Company Common Stock (and which Right was subsequently amended to represent the right to purchase a
Unit (as defined below) of Preferred Stock) upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereinafter set forth, and (ii)&nbsp;further authorized the issuance of one Right (as such number may have
been thereafter adjusted) with respect to each share of Company Common Stock that shall become outstanding between the Record Date and, except as provided in Section 22, the Distribution Date (as
defined herein); and </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
pursuant to authorization of the Board of Directors of the Company at a meeting properly noticed and convened on June&nbsp;21, 2000, this Agreement has been amended and
restated in accordance with the provisions of Section 27 hereof to provide, among other things, that (a)&nbsp;each share of Company Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date of
this Fourth Amended and Restated Rights Agreement shall entitle the holder thereof to one Right, (b)&nbsp;extend the Final Expiration Date (as defined below) and (c)&nbsp;amend the Purchase Price
(as defined below). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section
1.</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain Definitions.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;"</FONT><FONT
SIZE=2><I>Acquiring Person</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" shall mean any Person (as defined herein) who or which, alone or together with all Affiliates (as
defined herein) and Associates (as defined herein) of such Person, without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, shall be the Beneficial Owner (as defined herein) of 15% or more of the
outstanding Company Common Stock but shall not include (x) an Exempt Person (as defined herein) or (y) any such Person who has become and is such a Beneficial Owner solely because (A)&nbsp;of a
change in the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding since the last date on which such Person acquired Beneficial Ownership (as defined herein) of any shares of Company Common
Stock or (B)&nbsp;it acquired such Beneficial Ownership in the good faith belief that such acquisition would not (1)&nbsp;cause such Beneficial Ownership to equal or exceed 15% of the shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding and such Person relied in good faith in computing the percentage of its Beneficial Ownership on publicly filed reports or documents of the Company which are
inaccurate or out-of-date or (2)&nbsp;otherwise cause a Distribution Date or the adjustment provided for in Section 11(a)(ii)&nbsp;to occur. Notwithstanding clause (B)&nbsp;of the prior
sentence, if any Person that is not an Acquiring Person due to such clause (B)&nbsp;does not reduce its percentage of Beneficial Ownership of Company Common Stock to less than 15% by the Close of
Business (as defined herein) on the fifth Business Day (as defined herein) after notice from the Company (the date of notice being the first day) that such person's Beneficial Ownership of Company
Common Stock so equals or exceeds 15%, such Person shall at the end of such five Business Day period become an Acquiring Person (and such clause (B)&nbsp;shall no longer apply to such Person). For
purposes of this definition, the determination whether any Person acted in "good faith" shall be conclusively determined by the Board of Directors of the Company. </FONT></P>

as otherwise provided herein or by law, the holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and the holders of shares of Common Stock shall vote together

at any time dividends on any Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock shall be in arrears in an amount equal to six quarterly dividends

previous quarterly dividend periods and for the current quarterly dividend period on all Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have been declared and paid or set apart for
payment, all holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, shall have the right to elect two Directors. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;During
any default period, such voting rights of the holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock may be exercised initially at a special meeting called
pursuant to subparagraph (iii)&nbsp;of this Section 3(C)&nbsp;or at any annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter at annual meetings of stockholders, provided that neither such voting rights
nor any right of the holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock to increase, in certain cases, the authorized number of Directors may be exercised at any meeting unless one-third of the
outstanding Units of Preferred Stock shall be present at such meeting in person or by proxy. The absence of a quorum of the holders of Common Stock shall not affect the exercise by the holders of
Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock of such rights. At any meeting at which the holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock shall exercise such voting rights initially during an existing
default period, they shall have the right, voting separately as a class, to elect Directors to fill up to two vacancies in the Board of Directors, if any such vacancies may then exist, or, if such
right is exercised at an annual meeting, to elect two Directors. If the number which may be so elected at any special meeting does not amount to the required number, the holders of the Series&nbsp;A
Preferred Stock shall have the right to make such increase in the number of Directors as shall be necessary to permit the election by them of the required number. After the holders of Units of
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock shall have exercised their right to elect Directors during any default period, the number of Directors shall not be increased or decreased except as approved by a vote
of the holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock as herein provided or pursuant to the rights of any equity securities ranking senior to the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;Unless
the holders of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock shall, during an existing default period, have previously exercised their right to elect Directors, the
Board of Directors may order, or any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 25% of the total number of the Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock outstanding may request,
the calling of a special meeting of the holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, which meeting shall thereupon be called by the Secretary of the Corporation. Notice of such meeting and of
any annual meeting at which holders of Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote pursuant to this paragraph (C)(iii)&nbsp;shall be given to each holder of record of Units of
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock by mailing a copy of such notice to him at his last address as the same appears on the books of the Corporation. Such meeting shall be called for a time not earlier
than 20 days and not later then 60 days after such order or request or in default of the calling of such meeting within 60 days after such order or request, such meeting may be called on similar
notice by any stockholder or stockholders owning in the aggregate not less than 25% of the total number of outstanding Units of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
paragraph (C)(iii), no such special meeting shall be called during the 60 days immediately preceding the date fixed for the next annual meeting of the stockholders. </FONT></P>
