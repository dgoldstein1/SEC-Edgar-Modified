               Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
                                 (Unaudited)

1.  Basis of Presentation

The condensed consolidated financial statements as of April 3, 1999 and for 
the three-month periods ended April 3, 1999 and March 28, 1998, include, in 
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring 
adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the 
financial position, results of operations and cash flows at April 3, 1999 
and for all periods presented.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial 
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles have been condensed or omitted.  It is suggested that these 
condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the 
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto incorporated by 
reference in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1998.  
The results of operations for the three-month period ended April 3, 1999 
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for 
the full year.  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date 
of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

2.  Supplemental Balance Sheet Information

Inventories consist of the following (in millions):
                                                April 3,   Dec. 31,
                                                  1999        1998

   Inventories                                  $ 3,636     $ 3,745

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for 
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", requires the carrying 
value of certain investments to be adjusted to fair value.  The Company 
recorded an increase to stockholders' equity, other assets and deferred 
income taxes of $1.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $700 million as of April 3, 
1999; compared to an increase of $476 million, $787 million and $311 
million as of December 31, 1998.  

3.  Supplemental Cash Flows Information

Cash paid for interest during the first quarters of 1999 and 1998 was $71 
million and $60 million, respectively.  Cash paid for income taxes during 
the first quarters of 1999 and 1998 was $55 million and $158 million, 
respectively.

4.  Earnings Per Common Share

The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and 
denominators of basic and diluted earnings per common share:

                                                       Three Months Ended
                                                    April 3,      March 28,

  Per share amount                                   $  .28         $  .30

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the three 
months ended April 3, 1999, the assumed conversion of the zero coupon notes 
due 2009 was excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

5.  Reorganization of Businesses

In the second quarter of 1998, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of 
$1.98 billion to cover restructuring costs of $1.275 billion and asset 
impairments and other charges of $705 million.  Restructuring costs include 
costs to consolidate manufacturing operations throughout the Company; to 
exit non-strategic, poorly-performing businesses; and to reduce employment 
by a minimum of 15,000 from the approximately 150,000 employees worldwide 
at the beginning of the second quarter of 1998.  The following table 
displays a rollforward to April 3, 1999, of the accruals established during 
the second quarter of 1998:

                      Second                                   Accruals at
                   Quarter 1998      Amounts                      April 3,

Business exits             453          (101)             (162)        190
Employee separations       461          (512)              197         146
  Total restructuring   $1,275       $  (790)          $  ---          485
Asset impairments and
  other charges            705          (544)             ---          161
  Totals                $1,980       $(1,334)          $  ---       $  646

Amounts in the Reclassifications column represent the reallocation of 
accruals between categories and not increases in the initial charges.  
These reallocations were due to reductions in the cost estimates for 
consolidating manufacturing operations and exiting certain businesses 
offset by higher than anticipated severance costs.

For the business exits category, inception-to-date utilization was $172 
million, offset by $71 million of favorable adjustments related to:  a 
Semiconductor Products Segment technology agreement and the sale of the 
Integrated Electronic Systems Sector's non-silicon component manufacturing 
business to CTS Corp.

As of April 3, 1999, the Company has reduced employment by approximately 
24,000 employees since the middle of 1998.  Approximately 20,300 employees 
have separated from the Company through a combination of voluntary and 
involuntary severance programs and business exits related to these charges.  
This includes a reduction of the Company's employee population by 
approximately 4,200 people in connection with the sale of the non-silicon 
component manufacturing business in the first quarter of 1999.  Of the 
20,300 separated employees, approximately 13,400 were direct employees, and 
6,900 were indirect employees.  Direct employees are primarily non-
supervisory production employees, and indirect employees are primarily non-
production employees and production managers.  Remaining employee 
reductions resulting from severance programs still to be completed will 
more than likely be offset by expected additions to the Company's 
engineering, marketing and other critical functions.

As the Company's 1998 comprehensive manufacturing consolidation, cost 
reduction and restructuring programs reach their planned completion, 
management continues to assess the estimated costs to complete these 
programs.  Management believes the remaining accruals are adequate to cover 
these costs.

In 1997, the Company established restructuring accruals totaling $327 
million to exit its retail analog modem business in Huntsville, AL, to exit 
the MacOS(R)-compatible computer systems business, and to phase out 
participation in the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) market.  Through 
April 3, 1999, $271 million of the accruals had been utilized, and $34 
million had been reversed into income.  Of the remaining $22 million, 
approximately $8 million is expected to be used by the end of the second 
quarter of 1999.  The remaining $14 million relates to contract 
contingencies arising from the Company's exit from the MacOS-compatible 
computer systems business.  Management believes the remaining accrual is 
adequate to cover these matters.

6.  Comprehensive Earnings

Comprehensive earnings for the three-month periods ended April 3, 1999 and 
March 28, 1998 were $691 million and $321 million, respectively.  The 
current period unrecognized gain on cost-based investments of $1.1 billion 
properly excludes a reclassification adjustment of $41.8 million, net of 
tax, related to the sale of securities.

7.  Trust Originated Preferred Securities(SM)

In February 1999, Motorola Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business 
trust and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold 20 million Trust 
Originated Preferred Securities(SM) ("TOPrS") to the public at an aggregate 
offering price of $500 million.  The Trust used the proceeds from this 
sale, together with the proceeds from its sale of common stock to the 
Company, to buy a series of 6.68% Deferrable Interest Junior Subordinated 
Debentures due March 31, 2039 ("Subordinated Debentures") from the Company 
with the same payment terms as the TOPrS.  The Company, in turn, used the 
$484 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Subordinated Debentures 
to reduce short-term indebtedness.

(SM) "Trust Originated Preferred Securities" and "TOPrS" are service marks 
of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.

8.  Segment Information

Beginning in the first quarter of 1999, the Company changed the operating 
segments it uses for financial reporting purposes as a result of 
organizational changes implemented in its communications equipment 
businesses.  Historical segment data has been reworked to reflect these 
changes.  Summarized below are the Company's segment sales and operating 
profit (loss) before taxes as defined by new reportable segment for the 
three months ended April 3, 1999 and March 28, 1998.

                       Motorola, Inc. and Subsidiaries
                    Management's Discussion and Analysis
              of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Company's 
consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and 
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of 
operations incorporated by reference in the Company's Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 1998.

Results of Operations:

Sales were $7.2 billion in the first quarter of 1999, up 5 percent from 
$6.9 billion a year earlier.  Earnings were $171 million, or 28 cents per 
share in 1999, compared with $180 million, or 30 cents per share in the 
year-ago quarter.

First-quarter net margin on sales was 2.4 percent in 1999, compared with 
2.6 percent a year ago.

Personal Communications Segment sales rose 8 percent to $2.6 billion and 
orders were 16 percent higher.  Operating profits increased 23 percent to 
$83 million, as last year's results included a charge relating to exiting a 
product line.  Excluding that charge, operating profits were lower than a 
year ago, due to the performance of the paging business.

Sales of digital wireless telephones increased very significantly, while 
sales of analog wireless telephones were significantly lower, as the 
wireless industry's transition to digital technology continues.  Digital 
wireless telephone sales represented more than 80 percent of wireless 
telephone sales in the quarter.  Growth was particularly strong for CDMA 
(Code Division Multiple Access) telephones, but increased in all digital 
technology categories.  Paging product sales were significantly lower, 
while consumer two-way radio product sales were significantly higher.  
Sales were higher in all geographic markets, led by Asia.  

Network Systems Segment sales increased 5 percent to $1.6 billion and 
orders were up 5 percent.  Operating profits rose 29 percent to $193 
million.  

Sales of GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and CDMA systems 
increased very significantly.  Sales were higher in Japan for PDC (Personal 
Digital Cellular) systems, lower for iDEN(R) systems and very significantly 
lower for analog systems.  Digital infrastructure sales now comprise over 
95 percent of terrestrial systems revenue.  Sales also increased for 
satellite communications infrastructure equipment.  By geographic market, 
sales were up very significantly in Europe, significantly higher in Japan 
and lower in Asia and the Americas.  

Commercial, Government and Industrial Systems Segment sales declined 5 
percent to $885 million and orders were 26 percent higher.  Operating 
profits decreased to $52 million, as last year's operating profits included 
a gain on the sale of a one-third interest in the shared network operation 
of Motorola Communication Israel Ltd.  Excluding that gain, operating 
profits would still have been lower.

Two-way radio sales increased in North America, were lower in Europe and 
Asia, and declined significantly in Latin America.  Systems Solutions Group 
sales also were lower, due in part to lower revenue on U.S. government 
contracts.  

Semiconductor Products Segment sales increased 4 percent to $1.9 billion 
and orders were 11 percent higher.  The segment recorded an operating 
profit of $47 million compared with an operating loss of $58 million a year 
ago.  

Orders increased in Asia, the Americas and Japan, and declined in Europe.  
Orders were higher in all major market segments, led by wireless 
communications, networking and computing, transportation and semiconductor 
components.  

On May 11, 1999, the Company announced that Texas Pacific Group has agreed 
to lead a management buyout of the segment's Semiconductor Components 
Group.  Under the terms of the proposed transaction, the Company would 
receive total proceeds valued at approximately $1.6 billion, comprised of 
cash, notes and approximately 10% of the stock of the new company.  The 
transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 1999, subject 
to regulatory and other approvals. 

Integrated Electronic Systems Sector sales were flat and orders were 4 
percent lower.  Operating profits were flat.  These results include 
businesses that the sector has exited.  For continuing businesses, sales 
were up 10 percent, orders were up 5 percent and operating profits were 
lower, due to increased investment in Telematics automotive communications.  
The Telematics Communications Group had higher sales and orders, as its 
products were more widely accepted by the automotive market.  The 
previously announced sale of the sector's non-silicon component 
manufacturing business was completed in the quarter.  The sector's results 
are reported as part of the "Other Products" segment.

Internet and Networking Group sales increased 18 percent and orders were 30 
percent higher.  The group had an operating profit compared with a loss a 
year ago, due to a gain from the sale of securities.  Sales of cable modems 
and cable telephony products were significantly higher.  The group's results 
are reported as part of the "Other Products" segment.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were 19 percent of sales 
compared with 18 percent in the year-earlier period.  The increase in 
selling, general and administrative expenses compared to a year ago is due 
to recording an additional financing reserve related to the Company's 
financial support of Iridium, writedowns of certain Corporate fixed assets, 
higher foreign exchange losses and higher incentive compensation accruals 
necessitated by the Company's expected improvement in financial 
performance.  These higher expenses were partially offset by income from 
the sale of securities.  Depreciation expense decreased slightly as a 
percent of sales.  Depreciation expense for 1999 is presently expected to be 
relatively unchanged for the year compared to 1998.  Interest expense was 
flat as a percent of sales.  Assuming stable interest rates in 1999, 
interest expense is expected to be lower than a year ago in the remaining 
quarters and the full year of 1999.  The tax rate for the first quarter was 
30 percent, the same as a year ago.  The Company currently expects the tax 
rate to remain at 30 percent for 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:

Net cash provided by operations increased to $676 million for the three-
month period ended April 3, 1999, as compared to $43 million for the three-
month period ended March 28, 1998.  The increase in 1999 compared to 1998 
was primarily due to improved collections of accounts receivable balances 
and lower inventory balances resulting from programs focused on accounts 
receivable collections and inventory control programs.  

Net cash used in investing activities was $141 million for the three-month 
period ended April 3, 1999 as compared to $581 million used for the three-
month period ended March 28, 1998.  The majority of the decrease is due to 
fixed asset expenditures decreasing by $302 million in 1999 as compared to 
1998.  Two thirds of this reduction, or $200 million, occurred in 
semiconductor fixed asset expenditures.  For the full year of 1999, the 
Company's capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $3.0 
billion down from $3.2 billion in 1998.  Semiconductor capital expenditures 
are expected to be $900 million in 1999 compared to $1.8 billion in 1998.  
In addition to the decrease in fixed asset expenditures, cash was generated 
from the sale of fixed assets and inventory upon completion of the 
previously announced sale of the non-silicon component manufacturing 
business.

Net cash used in financing activities was $201 million for the three-month 
period ended April 3, 1999 as compared to cash provided by financing 
activities of $627 million in the three-month period ended March 28, 1998.  
The use of cash in 1999 was driven primarily by the Company paying down 
commercial paper and short-term borrowings as compared to increasing notes 
payable and current portion of long term debt in the same period last year 
in order to finance operations.  The Company was able to pay down short-
term borrowings in 1999 due to improved cash flow from operations and 
investing activities, which were primarily driven by lower accounts 
receivable and inventory balances and lower capital expenditures.  
Additionally, $484 million in net proceeds was generated from the sale of 
the Subordinated Debentures, as described in footnote 7 to the financial 
statements.  

Net debt to net debt plus equity decreased to 20.8 percent at April 3, 1999 
from 26.8 percent at December 31, 1998.  The Company's total domestic and 
foreign credit facilities aggregated $4.6 billion at April 3, 1999, none of 
which was used but was all available to back up outstanding commercial 
paper which totaled $2.0 billion.

The Company is an equity investor in, a creditor of, and a supplier to, 
Iridium LLC and its subsidiaries (collectively "Iridium").  Iridium is the 
first global wireless telecommunications business using a low-earth orbit 
satellite communications network.  Commercial voice service on the Iridium 
system began November 1, 1998.  Iridium is currently transitioning from a 
developmental stage company to an operating company and, accordingly, has 
no meaningful operating history.  This transition requires that Iridium 
attract a sufficient number of customers that use Iridium's services at 
levels that will generate enough revenue for Iridium to meet its financial 
obligations to a variety of parties, including the Company.  Iridium has 
experienced significant difficulties in making this transition, including 
that the number of subscribers for the service and revenue generated by 
Iridium have been substantially below Iridium's expectations.  Iridium 
operates in an essentially new market for wireless communications services 
and there can be no assurance that Iridium will be successful.

At April 3, 1999, the Company owned, directly and indirectly, approximately 
18% of the equity interests in Iridium and Iridium bonds with a face value 
of approximately $157 million.  The Company also holds equity investments 
and receivables with a book value of approximately $70 million in several 
Iridium gateway companies.  During the first quarter of 1999, the Company 
recorded, as its share of Iridium's net loss for the first quarter, a loss 
of approximately $50 million.  As a result, the Company's equity investment 
in Iridium, as reflected in its financial statements, is now zero.  The 
Company's bond investment in Iridium and its equity investments in several 
Iridium gateway companies are included in Other Assets.  

Iridium's bank facilities include an $800 million Senior Secured Credit 
Agreement (the "Secured Credit Agreement").  That agreement contains 
covenants that require Iridium to satisfy certain minimum revenue and 
customer levels as of various dates.  On March 29, 1999, Iridium announced 
that it would not meet its first quarter 1999 revenue and customer 
requirements, and that it had received a sixty-day waiver, until May 31, 
1999, from the lenders under the Secured Credit Agreement.  The waiver 
requires Iridium's compliance with the March 31, 1999 minimum revenue and 
customer requirements set forth in the covenants by May 31, 1999.  Iridium 
announced on May 13, 1999, that it did not expect to meet these minimum 
revenue and customer requirements by May 31, 1999, and that it was in 
discussions with its lenders under the Secured Credit Agreement to reduce 
these requirements.  There can be no assurance that (1) that the lenders 
under the Secured Credit Agreement will further revise those targets for 
future periods so that Iridium will remain in compliance with such 
covenants or (2) that such lenders will waive any future default, under 
such covenants or otherwise, should it occur.  If a default occurs under 
the Secured Credit Agreement, the lenders could accelerate Iridium's 
obligations under the Secured Credit Agreement and seek to foreclose on 
their security interests in substantially all of Iridium's assets and 
require certain investors in Iridium to comply with their capital call 
requirements.  In the Company's case, this would require an additional 
equity investment of approximately $50 million.  If this investment were 
required, it would be subject to the same accounting treatment as applied 
to the Company's prior equity investment in Iridium.   

If Iridium defaults under its Secured Credit Agreement, it will also be in 
default under a $750 million Senior Guaranteed Credit Agreement which the 
Company has directly guaranteed (the "Guaranteed Credit Agreement").  As of 
April 3, 1999, Iridium had borrowed $480 million of the $750 million 
available under the Guaranteed Credit Agreement.  The majority of this 
facility is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2000 and the remainder is 
scheduled to mature on December 31, 2001.  If Iridium were to default under 
the Guaranteed Credit Agreement, the banks providing loans under the 
Guaranteed Credit Agreement could terminate Iridium's ability to borrow 
under that agreement, accelerate all the outstanding obligations under that 
agreement and require the Company to satisfy its guarantee obligations as 
to amounts theretofore drawn.

The Company has also agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding to grant a 
guarantee of up to an additional $350 million of Iridium debt, subject to 
the satisfaction of certain conditions.  As of May 14, 1999, Iridium had 
not requested that any portion of the guarantee be applied in favor of 
either a new bank credit facility or the Secured Credit Agreement. 

A default by Iridium under its Secured Credit Agreement and Guaranteed 
Credit Agreement could result in defaults under other agreements, 
including, without limitation, the indentures relating to approximately 
$1.4 billion in public debt of Iridium.

The Company has also agreed to permit Iridium to defer up to $400 million 
of amounts owed under its operations and maintenance contracts with the 
Company.  As of April 30, 1999, Iridium had deferred $265 million of such 
payments and Iridium has indicated that it expects to request to defer an 
aggregate of $400 million of such payments prior to September 1, 1999.  The 
repayment by Iridium of these deferred payments is subordinated to 
repayment of Iridium's Secured Credit Agreement, as is the repayment to the 
Company by Iridium of any amounts the Company may pay to the lenders under 
its guarantees and certain other obligations owed to the Company.  Apart 
from the deferred payments described above, approximately $70 million is 
owed to the Company by Iridium, as of April 30, 1999.  

The Company has several contracts with Iridium, primarily for the operation 
and maintenance of the global personal communications system, under which 
aggregate payments are scheduled to be approximately $3.2 billion.  Through 
the end of April 1999, the Company had earned and received payments of 
approximately $259 million under these contracts.  The Company has 
significant subcontracts for portions of the system, for which it will 
generally remain obligated even if Iridium is unable to satisfy the terms 
of such contracts with the Company.  In addition, the Company has 
investments in assets related to these contracts, such as inventory, 
manufacturing equipment, buildings and potential obligations to the 
employees employed in connection with these contracts.  While the Company 
expects to be able to use a portion of these assets and some of these 
employees in connection with other programs, the Company would still incur 
substantial costs in winding down operations related to the Iridium program 
if Iridium were to cease to perform under such agreements. 

As Iridium continues its transition from a developmental stage company to 
an operating company, it will require significant amounts of cash to fund 
its operations.  Iridium disclosed in its Form 10-K for the year-end 
December 31, 1998, that it expected that its aggregate cash requirements 
for 1999 would be approximately $1.65 billion.  If Iridium defaults under 
its credit agreements its lenders may not waive such defaults.  This could 
subject the entire amount outstanding under its credit agreements to 
acceleration by the lenders and pursuit of other remedies, including 
enforcement of security interests in substantially all of the assets of 
Iridium.  This could result in Iridium's bankruptcy.  If Iridium is not 
able to repay amounts due to lenders under facilities guaranteed by the 
Company, the Company would be required to pay such guaranteed amounts.  
Finally, if such events occur, Iridium would likely not be able to repay in 
full the Company amounts theretofore deferred under its various contracts 
with the Company and might be unable to pay amounts becoming due under such 
contracts in the future.

In the context of an Iridium bankruptcy, it is possible that creditors and 
other stakeholders in Iridium may seek to bring various claims against the 
Company, with respect to payments previously made by Iridium to the 
Company, and otherwise.  As described herein under "Legal Proceedings," a 
number of purported class action lawsuits alleging securities law 
violations have been filed naming Iridium, certain current and former 
officers of Iridium and the Company as defendants.

The loss of the value of its investment in Iridium and Iridium gateway 
companies, any default by Iridium under its credit agreements and debt 
instruments which results in the acceleration of Iridium debt or the 
Company having to perform under its Iridium guarantee obligations and the 
failure of Iridium to make contractual payments to the Company, 
collectively, would have a material negative impact on the Company's 
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

As a multinational company, the Company's transactions are denominated in a 
variety of currencies.  The Company uses financial instruments to hedge, 
and therefore attempts to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of 
currency fluctuations on cash flows.  The Company's policy is not to 
speculate in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price 
fluctuation, trade in currencies for which there are no underlying 
exposures, or enter into trades for any currency to intentionally increase 
the underlying exposure.  Instruments used as hedges must be effective at 
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged and must be 
designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.  Accordingly, 
changes in market values of hedge instruments must be highly correlated 
with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception 
of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

The Company's strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues is to offset the 
gains or losses of the financial instruments against losses or gains on the 
underlying operational cash flows or investments based on the operating 
business units' assessment of risk.  Currently, the Company primarily 
hedges firm commitments, including assets and liabilities currently on the 
balance sheet.  The Company expects that it may hedge anticipated 
transactions, forecasted transactions or investments in foreign 
subsidiaries in the future.

Almost all of the Company's non-functional currency receivables and 
payables which are denominated in major currencies that can be traded on 
open markets are hedged.  The Company uses forward contracts and options to 
hedge these currency exposures.  A portion of the Company's exposure is to 
currencies which are not traded on open markets, such as those in Latin 
America and China, and these are addressed, to the extent reasonably 
possible, through managing net asset positions, product pricing, and other 
means, such as component sourcing.

At April 3, 1999 and March 28, 1998, the Company had net outstanding 
foreign exchange contracts totaling $2.0 billion and $2.3 billion, 
respectively. The following schedule shows the five largest foreign 
exchange hedge positions as of April 3, 1999 and the corresponding 
positions at March 28, 1998:

In millions
Buy (Sell)              April 3,          March 28,
                         1999               1998
Japanese Yen             (798)              (831)
Euro                     (547)              (337)
Korean Won               (161)               (13)
Chinese Renminbi         (110)               (20)
British Pound            (106)              (535)

At April 3, 1999 and March 28, 1998, outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
primarily consisted of short-term forward contracts.  Net deferred gains at 
April 3, 1999, and net deferred losses at March 28, 1998, on these forward 
contracts which hedge designated firm commitments were immaterial.

As of the end of the reporting period, the Company had no outstanding 
interest rate swaps, commodity derivatives, currency swaps or options 
relating to either its debt instruments or investments.  The Company does 
not have any derivatives to hedge the value of its equity investments in 
affiliated companies.

The Company's research and development expenditures for the three-month 
periods ended April 3, 1999, and March 28, 1998, were $744 million and $703 
million, respectively.  The Company continues to believe that a strong 
commitment to research and development drives long-term growth.  Research 
and development expenditures are expected to increase as a percentage of 
sales in 1999 versus 1998.

Return on average invested capital, based on the performance of the four 
preceding fiscal quarters ending April 3, 1999, was (6.2) percent, compared 
with 7.2 percent based on the performance of the four preceding fiscal 
quarters ending March 28, 1998.  The Company's current ratio was 1.32 at 
April 3, 1999, compared to 1.18 at December 31, 1998.

Year 2000:

Motorola has been actively addressing Year 2000 issues since 1997.  A Year 
2000 Enterprise Council was formed and is responsible for coordinating and 
facilitating activities across the Company.  The Year 2000 Enterprise 
Council reports to the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer and 
its progress is reported to the Audit and Legal Committee of the Board of 
Directors.  The Board of Directors also receives periodic updates on the 
Company's Year 2000 program.

The Year 2000 issue refers to the risk that systems, products and equipment 
having date-sensitive components will not recognize the Year 2000.  
Throughout this disclosure the Company uses the generic phrase "year 2000 
ready" to mean that a system, product or piece of equipment will perform 
its intended functions on or after January 1, 2000 the same as it did 
before January 1, 2000.  The Company also has a specific definition of Year 
2000 Ready for Motorola products described below.  

The Six-Phase Year 2000 Program

Motorola developed the Six-Phase Year 2000 Program to ensure a thorough and 
standard approach to addressing the Year 2000 issue across the Company.  

The Program summarizes the tasks to be completed while leaving each 
business to tailor actions specifically to its environment, to identify the 
goals of each phase, and to schedule their targeted completion dates.  The 
six-phases are Preliminary (identify the issues, create awareness, and 
dedicate resources); Discovery/Charter (inventory, categorize, and make 
initial cost estimates); Scope (refine inventory and assess business 
impacts and risks); Conversion Planning (determine specific implementation 
solutions through analysis, formulate strategies, and develop project and 
test plans); Conversion (make program changes, perform applications and 
acceptance testing and certification); and Deployment and Post 
Implementation Review (deploy program and software changes, evaluate and 
apply lessons learned).  

The Company's Readiness 

All of the Company's sectors and groups have substantially completed Phases 
1-4, all but one of the groups also have substantially completed Phase 5 
and all but three of the Company's groups also have substantially completed 
Phase 6.  All of the Company's sectors and groups are expected to complete 
the Six-Phase Program by at least the third quarter of 1999.  The work being 
completed in 1999 is being separately monitored and tracked with 
appropriate target completion dates.  

Contingency plans are substantially complete for all sectors and groups, 
and those plans are focusing on matters not resolved through the Six-Phase 
Program at this time that may have a material negative impact on Motorola's 
final "year 2000 readiness".  Discussion of contingency planning is included 
below.  

As part of the Company's overall program and to ensure adequate means to 
measure progress, Motorola has established five functional categories to be 
reviewed by each business as follows: 

Products.  While addressing all five functional categories, the Company has 
placed a high priority on ensuring that Motorola products are Year 2000 
Ready and is completing a comprehensive review of the Year 2000 Readiness 
of Motorola products.  The results of these reviews are being made available 
to Motorola customers and third parties through the use of a Motorola Year 
2000 website and are supplemented with additional written communications.  
The Motorola definition of "Year 2000 Ready," which is the standard 
Motorola uses to determine the Year 2000 Readiness of Motorola products, is 
as follows: 

Year 2000 Ready means the capability of a Motorola product, when used in 
accordance with its associated documentation, to correctly process, provide 
and/or receive date data in and between the years 1999 and 2000, including 
leap year calculations, provided that all other products and systems (for 
example, hardware, software and firmware) used with the Motorola product 
properly exchange accurate date data with it.  

Manufacturing.  Some of the tools and equipment (hardware and software) 
used to develop and manufacture Motorola products are date-sensitive.  The 
Company believes, based on the results of the Six-Phase Program to date and 
based on assurances from its suppliers, that the critical tools and 
equipment used by it to manufacture products will be "year 2000 ready" or 
will be made ready through upgrades by the suppliers of the tools or 
equipment or by using alternate sources of supplies.  As a result, the 
Company does not expect significant interruption to its manufacturing 
capabilities because of the failure of tools and/or equipment.  

Non-Manufacturing Business Applications.  Throughout the business the 
Company is fixing and testing all non-manufacturing business applications 
such as core financial information and reporting, procurement, human 
resources/payroll, factory applications, customer service, and revenue, and 
does not expect any significant Year 2000 issues in this area. 

Facilities and Infrastructure.  The Company also is fixing and testing its 
facilities and infrastructure (health, safety and environment systems, 
buildings, security/alarms/doors, desktop computers, networks) to ensure 
they are "year 2000 ready" and does not expect significant interruption to 
its operations because of Year 2000 issues with its facilities or 
infrastructure. 

Logistics.  The Company has devoted significant resources to ensure that 
its operations are not disrupted because of services or products supplied 
to the Company.  In addition, the Company has requested assurances from its 
joint venture partners and alliance partners of their "year 2000 
readiness." 

Of critical importance to the Company's Year 2000 Readiness is the 
readiness of suppliers and the products the Company procures from 
suppliers.  Motorola has many thousands of suppliers and has a comprehensive 
program to identify and obtain Year 2000 information from its critical 
suppliers.  The program includes awareness letters, site visits, 
questionnaires, compliance agreements and warranties as well as a review of 
suppliers' Year 2000 websites.  If a supplier is determined to entail a 
"high risk" of Year 2000 non-readiness, the Company is developing 
contingency and alternate sourcing plans to minimize the Year 2000 risk.  

As described in the Company's discussion of most reasonably likely worst 
case scenarios, the Company is particularly concerned about energy and 
transportation suppliers.  Many of these suppliers are unwilling to provide 
assurances that they will be "year 2000 ready." 

Unique issues related to the readiness of the Company's major businesses 
are discussed in more detail below.  

Year 2000 Costs 

Motorola estimates that the expected total aggregate costs for its Year 
2000 activities from 1997 through 2000 will be in the range of $250 million 
to $300 million.  These costs do not include estimates for potential 
litigation.  Approximately $150 million of the total estimated costs relate 
to internal resources.  Total costs incurred through April 3, 1999 were 
approximately $140 million, of which approximately $89 million were for 
external costs.  Of the remaining costs, the majority relate to installation 
of software upgrades of certain infrastructure equipment, installing 
software upgrades to internal semiconductor manufacturing equipment and 
assessing the Company's critical suppliers.  The Company does not believe 
the cost of addressing Year 2000 issues will have a material adverse effect 
on the Company's consolidated results of operations, liquidity or capital 
resources.  

The Company reviews and updates data for costs incurred and forecasted 
costs each quarter.  As the Company continues to assess the last phases of 
the Year 2000 Program, estimated costs may change.  These costs are based on 
management's estimates, which were determined based on assumptions of 
future events, some within the Company's control, but many outside of the 
Company's control.  There can be no guarantee that these estimates will be 
correct, and if actual costs increased by a sizeable amount, the Company's 
actual results could be materially adversely impacted.  

Most Reasonably Likely Worst Case Scenarios for the Company and Company 
Contingency Plans 

The Company has and will continue to devote substantial resources to 
address its Year 2000 issues.  However, there can be no assurances that the 
Company's products do not contain undetected Year 2000 issues.  Further, 
there can be no assurances that the Company's assessment of suppliers and 
vendors will be accurate.  Customers of Motorola could be impacted by Year 
2000 issues causing them to reduce purchases from the Company.  In addition, 
many commentators believe that there will be a significant amount of 
litigation arising out of "year 2000 readiness" issues, especially for 
product liability.  Because of the unprecedented nature of this litigation, 
it is impossible for the Company to predict the impact of such litigation 
although it could be significant to the Company.  In addition to the unique 
reasonably likely worst case scenarios described by the specific businesses 
and potential litigation, the Company believes its scenarios include: (i) 
corruption of data contained in the Company's internal information systems; 
(ii) hardware failures; (iii) the failure of infrastructure services 
provided by government agencies and other third-party suppliers (including 
energy, water, and transport); and (iv) health, environmental and safety 
issues relating to its facilities.  If any of these were to occur, the 
Company' operations could be interrupted, in some cases for a sustained 
period of time.  These interruptions could be more severe in countries 
outside the U.S., where the Company does sizeable business.  

The Company's contingency plans focus on customers, products, supplies and 
internal operations.  Each sector is establishing emergency operations 
centers at key locations.  These centers will be staffed ahead of the Year 
2000 rollover and well into the Year 2000.  During critical times they will 
be staffed 24-hours a day.  The first priority of these centers is to 
ensure the performance of a customer's network or system. 

Critical facilities have been identified and the Company's plans prioritize 
their continued operations.  These sites will be supported by generators 
capable of maintaining health, safety, communications and environmental 
operations if locally provided power sources fail.  These sites will have a 
number of means of communicating including Intranet, pagers, cellular 
phones, and satellite phones.

The businesses are identifying key individuals in a variety of functions to 
be on-site at the Company's facilities to monitor the rollover to the Year 
2000.  Additionally, the Company is establishing rapid response teams that 
can be sent to major customer locations when and if needed in connection 
with the rollover.  There are also plans to shift operations to different 
facilities if there are interruptions to operations in particular areas, 
countries or regions.  

The plans also include procedures to maintain and recover business 
operations such as stockpiling critical supplies, identifying alternate 
supply sources, inspecting critical functions, reporting operational 
status, communicating with interdependent operations, and operating in 
contingency mode until a return to normal.

The sectors and groups continue to perform various tests, including on 
manufacturing production lines and internal networks.  Each business will 
also be testing its contingency plans during the third quarter of 1999.  In 
addition, the Company has planned a test of its overall contingency plans 
for the third quarter of 1999.  

Personal Communications Segment 

The Personal Communications Segment includes both the Personal 
Communications Sector (PCS) and the iDEN(R) subscriber business.  PCS, which 
designs, develops, manufactures and sells Motorola cellular telephones, 
paging subscriber products, and paging infrastructure equipment has 
completed its Year 2000 product review.  

All Motorola cellular telephones currently on the market either: (i) do not 
contain internal date storage, processing, or display capabilities and thus 
are not impacted by the Year 2000 date change; or (ii) contain internal 
date storage, processing, or display capabilities that are Year 2000 Ready.  
In addition, PCS has systems in place to ensure that future cellular 
telephones sold by the Company will be Year 2000 Ready.  

Paging products currently being shipped are Year 2000 Ready.  Paging has 
identified customer system upgrades required to enable certain 
infrastructure equipment in Asia to be Year 2000 Ready.  These upgrades are 
scheduled to be complete by August 1999.  Paging has posted on its website 
and sent in printed form to inquiring customers lists of all its products 
that have no internal calendars or clocks and are not materially impacted 
by the Year 2000, all products that have such clocks and calendars and are 
Year 2000 Ready, and a third group of products that have reached the end of 
their supported life and, therefore, have not been tested for Year 2000 
Readiness.  Certain infrastructure products that require an upgrade to be 
Year 2000 Ready have been listed on the website.  

Paging's management believes the worst case scenario is that a mission 
critical page may not be sent or received as a result of lack of Year 2000 
Readiness of messaging software, infrastructure or pagers and the Company 
is sued.  Management believes that its efforts at communicating to paging 
customers the potential for such failures should reduce the likelihood of 
this occurring.

Network Solutions Segment

The Network Solutions segment includes the cellular infrastructure 
business, the satellite communications business and iDEN infrastructure 
products.  

The cellular infrastructure business designs and develops, manufactures, 
installs and services wireless infrastructure equipment for cellular and 
personal communications networks.  Certain cellular infrastructure products 
operate with date sensitivity.  The business is developing appropriate 
hardware modifications and new versions of software to address the Year 
2000 issue.  The business has made upgrades (i.e., hardware modifications 
and/or new software versions, as appropriate) available to most of its 
operator customers.  The remaining upgrades for certain unique systems will 
be available by the end of the second quarter of 1999.  The business sells 
systems throughout the world and trained technicians are in the process of 
installing these upgrades.  

The cellular infrastructure business has communicated to customers and 
company customer contacts "work-arounds" for certain systems that will not 
be upgraded.  A "work-around" gives the operator necessary procedures to 
keep the system operating on and after January 1, 2000.  If a customer does 
not follow the recommended procedures it is likely that the system will not 
recognize certain dates properly, affecting the accuracy of certain data.  
The business has concluded that some of its systems are too old to either 
upgrade or provide a work-around for Year 2000 issues.  It has notified 
customers with outdated systems.  Additionally, a website provides Year 2000 
information on discontinued products.  Some customers of discontinued 
products have been notified that their system will not work and information 
has been provided on needed upgrades and/or replacements.  The business is 
now in the process of sending out second notices and asking for 
confirmations back from these customers.  

Management believes that its most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
related to the Year 2000 issue is its inability to upgrade all systems 
before January 1, 2000 due to the significant number of customer locations 
to be visited and to delays by customers in scheduling upgrades.  As a 
result, system performance could be affected and certain data routinely 
available from those systems could be inaccurate on and after January 1, 
2000 until upgraded.  As a result, the business could incur cost, and 
potentially be sued as the supplier of those systems, although its efforts 
to identify its customers and provide software solutions should reduce 
these risks.  

The satellite business designs, develops, manufactures, integrates, 
deploys, operates and maintains space-based telecommunication systems and 
related ground system components.  At present, the business consists of one 
operating system known as the Iridium(R) System.  This system contains date-
sensitive functions.  The business expects to make any necessary hardware 
and/or software upgrades available to customers by July 1, 1999.  The 
business anticipates that it will need to supply technicians to install any 
such upgrades, and does not presently anticipate any difficulty in meeting 
any potential installation needs.  

Management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
related to the Year 2000 issue is a temporary interruption of the Iridium 
System due to the inability of the ground segment to communicate with the 
satellite constellation.  As a result, the satellite business would incur 
costs in correcting such a failure.  Management believes adequate efforts 
are in place to identify potential hardware/software problems and to 
implement and test solutions.  

Some iDEN(R) infrastructure products operate with date sensitivity.  The 
iDEN system is expected to be Year 2000 Ready when a new system release is 
completed by June 30, 1999.  While the business expects to deploy this 
release in a timely matter, it will confront the same resource and 
installation issues facing the Company's infrastructure businesses.

Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions Segment 

The segment, consisting of the Commercial, Government and Industrial 
Solutions Sector ("CGISS"), manufactures and sells two-way voice and data 
products and systems for a variety of worldwide applications.  Principal 
customers for two-way products include public safety agencies (police, 
fire, etc.), utilities, diverse industrial companies, transportation 
companies and companies in various other industries.  Additionally, CGISS 
includes the System Solutions Group (SSG), excluding its satellite 
business, that is engaged in the design, development, and production of 
advanced electronic communications systems and products.  

All two-way products currently shipping from factories are Year 2000 Ready 
with a few minor exceptions.  All customers buying exceptions are fully 
informed that these products are not Year 2000 Ready before purchases are 
made and products shipped.  Some older products operate with date 
sensitivity, including legacy Special Products (SPs) and "911 Systems." 
CGISS has notified or is in the process of notifying customers of certain 
of its "911 Systems" in the U.S. that their systems are not fully Year 2000 
Ready.  New software for these systems and the code were available in 
December 1998 and a test installation of such software was made in late 
December 1998.  Regular customer installations will continue through the end 
of third quarter 1999.  SPs are communication systems designed specifically 
for particular customers.  CGISS cannot assess whether those systems are 
Year 2000 Ready because the systems must be tested where they are located.  
CGISS is contacting customers and developing solutions, usually software 
upgrades, to make these systems Year 2000 Ready.  

Management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
involving its business is the failure of a public safety system on January 
1, 2000 (or thereafter).  As a result, the two-way radio business could 
potentially be sued as the supplier of those systems.  Management believes 
that its efforts to identify the customers of these systems and provide 
software solutions should reduce these risks.  

SSG has conducted a comprehensive review of all products and systems sold 
under contracts and purchase orders executed since January 1, 1990.  Through 
that process it has been determined that relatively few of SSG's products 
or systems contain date-sensitive functions that are expected to be 
adversely affected by the Year 2000 issue.  SSG is addressing each of the 
few products or systems affected in one of four ways.  First, SSG has 
developed, or is in the process of developing, fixes for some of the Year 
2000 issues discovered and is offering those fixes to its customers.  
Second, in some cases, SSG is working directly with customers who have 
funded specific testing and corrective actions to products or systems they 
purchased or are purchasing under contracts with SSG.  Some of these 
customer-funded fixes are not expected to be complete until the middle of 
1999.  Third, "work-arounds" have been communicated to certain customers 
when a more elaborate fix is not necessary for them to keep their products 
or systems operating on and after January 1, 2000.  Finally, SSG has 
concluded that some of its products and systems are too old to either fix 
or provide a work-around for Year 2000 Readiness.  SSG has notified (or made 
reasonable efforts to notify) customers of those products or systems for 
which fixes or work-arounds will not be available.  

SSG believes the most reasonably likely worst case scenario related to the 
Year 2000 issue is the failure of a product or system to operate for a 
short period of time after January 1, 2000.  As a result, SSG may be sued as 
a manufacturer of products or systems that failed.  Many of these products 
or systems were sold to government customers.  Management believes it 
generally does not have legal liability to these customers.  

Semiconductor Products Segment 

The segment, consisting of the Semiconductor Product Sector ("SPS"), has 
completed an extensive review of its products to determine if they are Year 
2000 Ready.  The vast majority of these products are Year 2000 Ready.  A 
limited number of products that contain a real-time clock function are 
identified as having a potential Year 2000 issue with the manner in which 
years are tracked.  In addition, it is possible that an SPS semiconductor 
may experience "year 2000 readiness" issues due to the manner in which a 
customer has programmed the semiconductor or due to the manner in which the 
semiconductor is incorporated into a customer system or product.  SPS is 
also making information available to its customers on these potential Year 
2000 readiness issues.  

Literature on the Year 2000 issue references what is referred to as the 
"embedded chip" Year 2000 issue or the "embedded systems" Year 2000 issue.  
(The word "chip" is a short-hand reference for a semiconductor product.)  
Many common electronic products contain "chips" or "systems" containing 
chips that are incorporated or "embedded" into the product.  If these 
"chips" or "systems" experience Year 2000 readiness issues, due to the 
manner in which they are programmed, the product may malfunction.  Because 
this programming is customer defined, the extent to which the 
malfunctioning of these products may occur due to a Year 2000 Readiness 
issue with a SPS semiconductor is unknown at this time.  

With relatively few internal items from the global multi-phase approach 
remaining to be fixed, validated, and solutions deployed throughout the 
organization, SPS, in conjunction with the newly formed High Tech 
Consortium - Year 2000 and Beyond, is focusing on assessing external 
critical suppliers, including utilities and critical transportation.  This 
effort is global in scope.  In addition, SPS is taking actions to make 
information available on the potential Year 2000 issues with the real time 
clocks and the customer programming of SPS semiconductor products.  
Finally, the business is reconfirming the readiness of its environmental 
health and safety systems. 

Integrated Electronic Systems Sector (IESS) 

The Integrated Electronic Systems Sector (IESS) manufactures and sells 
automotive and industrial electronics, energy storage products and systems, 
electronic fluorescent ballasts and computer system products. 

IESS has completed formal assessment of "Year 2000 Readiness" of its 
products manufactured within the last eight years and its manufacturing 
facilities.  Other than embedded board and system products, and Global 
Positioning System receivers, these products do not contain date-sensitive 
functions, excluding customer provided software incorporated in such 
products, for which IESS does not have sufficient information in most cases 
to conduct an evaluation of whether such functions are included.  Motorola 
has advised its customers that responsibility for evaluating this software 
is that of the customer.  The sector is substantially complete with the Six-
Phase Program.  The remaining projects relate to internal systems of a 
handful of suppliers that the sector is working with to ensure that they 
will be ready.  

In the case of Global Positioning System receivers, engineering analysis is 
complete on the most current version, and the products are Year 2000 Ready.  
The operation of such receivers is dependent on the proper functioning of 
the Global Positioning satellite system maintained and operated by the 
Federal government, and is outside of the control of Motorola.  There is a 
second date-related issue for these products, relating to the "1024 weeks" 
method of date calculation used in the satellites, which will potentially 
impact the GPS in August 1999.  While the products are believed to be Year 
2000 Ready, full evaluation of the products for this date rollover 
phenomenon continues at this time.  

In the case of embedded boards, systems and software products that are 
manufactured by the Motorola Computer Group (MCG), some of the older 
products do not meet Motorola's definition of Year 2000 Ready.  In many of 
these cases, MCG has made fixes available to its customers to cure the 
problem.  Although it is difficult to measure any potential liability from 
non-Year 2000 Ready products, MCG believes the risks are relatively small 
based on the following.  Since October 1, 1998, MCG has ceased shipping any 
products that are not Year 2000 Ready without a waiver from the customer.  
Fixes have been made available for products that may remain under warranty 
after 1999.  Many products which are outside the warranty period, have been 
updated over the years with products that are Year 2000 Ready.  Other 
potential liability may arise in cases where it is not known in what 
applications the products are being used.  There is always the possibility 
that some products have been incorporated by customers into critical use 
applications.  All of the known cases are being evaluated but Motorola 
believes that this is the customer's responsibility.  

The business has reviewed the year 2000 readiness of its key suppliers.  
Suppliers that are considered "high-risk" vendors because of Year 2000 
issues have been identified.  The sector continues to assess these suppliers 
and has developed contingency plans that may include the use of alternate 
suppliers to minimize any potential risk.  

Internet and Networking Group (ING) 

ING manufactures and sells modems, data communication devices and equipment 
that enables voice, video and data communications over private and public 
networks.  All data communications equipment and modems currently sold by 
ING are Year 2000 Ready.  Some of the older products, including some network 
management and router software products,  do not meet Motorola's definition 
of Year 2000 Ready.  In many of these cases, ING has made fixes available 
to its customers.  Some products have also reached the end of their 
supported life and, therefore, have not been tested for Year 2000 
Readiness.  

Management believes that the most reasonably likely worst case scenario 
involving its business is the failure of a mission critical  or financial 
communications system on January 1, 2000 (or thereafter).  As a result, ING 
could potentially be sued as the supplier of the communications equipment.  
Management believes that its efforts to notify its customers of products 
with issues and provide software solutions should reduce these risks.

The Company has made forward-looking statements regarding its Year 2000 
Program.  Those statements include: the Company's expectations about when it 
will be "Year 2000 Ready"; the Company's expectations about the impact of 
the Year 2000 issue on its ability to continue to operate on and after 
January 1, 2000; the readiness of its suppliers; the costs associated with 
the Year 2000 Program; and worst case scenarios.  The Company has described 
many of the risks associated with those forward-looking statements above.  
However, the Company wishes to caution the reader that there are many 
factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those 
stated in the forward-looking statements.  This is especially the case 
because many aspects of its Year 2000 Program are outside its control such 
as the performance of many thousands of third-party suppliers, customers 
and end-users.  As a global company it operates in many different countries, 
some of which may not be addressing the Year 2000 issues to the same extent 
as in the United States.  As a result, there may be unforeseen issues in 
different parts of the world.  All of these factors make it impossible for 
the Company to ensure that it will be able to resolve all Year 2000 issues 
in a timely manner to avoid materially adversely affecting its operations 
or business or exposing the Company to third-party liability.

Euro Conversion:

For disclosure regarding the impact to the Company from the introduction of 
the euro, see the information contained under the caption "Euro Conversion" 
on pages F-13 and F-14 of the Company's Proxy Statement for its 1999 annual 
meeting of stockholders.

Outlook:

The Company is benefiting in the near term from having accomplished the 
solutions-focused reorganization and significant cost reduction faster than 
anticipated, as well as improving market positions in both the integrated 
communications solutions and embedded electronic solutions arenas.

Weak economic conditions in some regions of the world will continue to 
affect the Company's rate of growth, as will the market adjustments still 
taking place in analog wireless telephones and paging.  However, the 
Company is beginning to see signs of regional recovery in certain parts of 
Asia, and the U.S. economy remains strong.

The Company's changes in structure and strategy, as well as improved 
consumer and customer focus and better cost management are all increasing 
the Company's ability to improve financial results.  The Company's 
management team is committed to investing in brand marketing, advanced 
digital technology, software, and continuous business model modification in 
order to make it more globally competitive.  The Company will continue to 
pursue a rigorous focus on improving its financial results, balanced with 
the necessary business and technology investments to earn leadership in 
market segments.

Business Risks:

Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking and involve 
risks and uncertainties.  These include the statements in "Outlook" and 
statements about Iridium, Motorola's 1999 depreciation expenses, interest 
expense, tax rate, fixed asset expenditures, research and development 
expenditures, the sale of the Semiconductor Components Group and the impact 
of Year 2000 issues.  Motorola wishes to caution the reader that the 
factors below and those in Motorola's 1999 Proxy Statement on pages F-16 
through F-18 and in its other SEC filings could cause Motorola's results to 
differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements.  
These factors include: (i) the ability of Motorola to complete the 
manufacturing consolidations, cost reductions and restructuring actions in 
a timely manner and the continued success of those efforts; (ii) the 
ability of Motorola to integrate its businesses to reduce costs and 
increase efficiencies; (iii) unanticipated impact of the renewal plan on 
productivity and the ability of Motorola to retain and where necessary 
recruit employees; (iv) continued gains in the digital wireless telephone 
market and market acceptance of new products; (v) continued improvement in 
the semiconductor industry; (vi) economic conditions in China and its 
response to the economic downturn in parts of Asia; (vii) the success of 
efforts to stabilize economic conditions in parts of Asia, Latin America 
and other emerging markets; (viii) pricing pressures and demand for 
Motorola's products especially in light of the current economic conditions 
in parts of Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets; (ix) the 
weakening of currencies in parts of Asia, Latin America and other emerging 
markets compared to the U.S. dollar; (x) the potential that deteriorating 
economic conditions in Japan could continue or worsen;  (xi) the success of 
the Iridium(R) project and the impact on Motorola; (xii) Iridium's ability 
to meet its financing needs in order to make contractual payments, 
including to Motorola, to make debt payments and to otherwise operate; 
(xiii) the success of alliances and agreements with other companies to 
develop new products and services; (xiv) product and technology development 
and commercialization risks, including for newer digital products and 
Iridium products and services; (xv) unexpected delays or developments in 
connection with the sale of the Semiconductor Components Group; and (xvi) 
unanticipated impact of Year 2000 issues, particularly the failure of 
products or services of major suppliers to function properly in the Year 
2000 and reduced purchases by customers because of the adverse impact of 
Year 2000 issues on their businesses.

                          Part II - Other Information

Item 1 - Legal Proceedings.

Motorola has been a defendant in several cases arising out of its 
manufacture and sale of portable cellular telephones.  Schiffner v. 
Motorola, Inc., filed on March 3, 1995 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, 
Illinois, was a purported class action by purchasers of portable cellular 
phones alleging economic losses.  On March 22, 1999, the United States 
Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for writ of certiorari, 
thereby terminating the litigation in favor of Motorola.  Jerald P. Busse, 
et al. v. Motorola, Inc. et al., filed on October 26, 1995 in the Circuit 
Court of Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division, is a purported class 
action alleging that defendants have failed to adequately warn consumers of 
the alleged dangers of cellular telephones and challenging ongoing safety 
studies as invasions of privacy.  All claims have been dismissed on 
defendants' motions.  Plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration of the 
Court's decision.  Silber, et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al., filed on 
August 1, 1995 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of 
Suffolk, is an action wherein it is alleged that a traffic accident was 
caused by the use of a cellular phone.  On April 27, 1999, the Court 
granted defendants' motion for summary judgment and dismissed the suit.  
Plaintiffs may appeal. 
Motorola has been named as one of several defendants in Freeland v. Iridium 
World Communications, LTD, et al., Yong v. Iridium World Communications, 
LTD, et al., Kleinman v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et al., 
Marshall v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et al., Ackerman v. Iridium 
World Communications, LTD, et al., Hargrove v. Iridium World 
Communications, LTD, et al., and Turner v. Iridium World Communications et 
al., a series of nearly identical putative class action securities lawsuits 
filed beginning April 22, 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the District 
of Columbia. All of these lawsuits allege violations of the Federal 
securities laws arising from alleged material misrepresentations or 
omissions regarding difficulties in the satellite communications business 
of Iridium World Communications, LTD, Iridium LLC and Iridium Operating 
LLC. The alleged classes consist of purchasers of all Iridium securities 
during the period from September 9, 1998 to March 29, 1999.

See Item 3 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 
31, 1998 for additional disclosures regarding pending matters.

In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters 
will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial 
position, liquidity or results of operations of Motorola.
