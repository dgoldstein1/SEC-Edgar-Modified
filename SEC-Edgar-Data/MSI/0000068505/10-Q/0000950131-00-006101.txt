1.  Basis of Presentation

On January 5, 2000, Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") completed its previously
announced merger with General Instrument Corporation ("General Instrument") by
exchanging 301 million shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 common
stock split described below) of its common stock for all of the common stock of
General Instrument. Each share of General Instrument was exchanged for 1.725
shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 common stock split described
below) of Motorola's common stock. Motorola has accounted for the merger as a
pooling-of-interests and accordingly, all prior period consolidated financial
statements of Motorola have been restated to include the results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of General Instrument. The effects of
conforming General Instrument's accounting policies to those of Motorola were
not material.

For the three-month period ended October 2, 1999, net sales for Motorola and
General Instrument were $7.7 billion and $544 million, respectively. Net
earnings for Motorola and General Instrument were $91 million and $23 million,
respectively. For the nine-month period ended October 2, 1999, net sales for
Motorola and General Instrument were $22.4 billion and $1.6 billion,
respectively. Net earnings for Motorola and General Instrument were $468 million
and $100 million, respectively. Results of operations for the three-month and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2000, already reflect the
pooling-of-interests. From this point onward, all references to Motorola, Inc.
or the Company reflect the pooling-of-interests.

On June 1, 2000, the Company had a 3-for-1 common stock split in the form of a
200% stock dividend. On that date, the Company distributed 1.4 billion common
shares to stockholders of record on May 15, 2000. The par value of the common
stock remained at $3 per share. The effect of the stock split has been
recognized retroactively in the stockholders' equity accounts as of December 31,
1999, and in all share and per share data in the accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes to condensed consolidated
financial statements. The stockholders' equity accounts have been restated to
reflect the reclassification of an amount equal to the par value of the increase
in issued common shares from additional paid-in capital and retained earnings to
common stock.

The condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2000 and for
the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2000 and October 2,
1999, include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of September 30,
2000 and for all periods presented.

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
have been condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto incorporated by reference in the Company's Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, as supplemented

                                       7
<PAGE>

by Form 8-K/As filed on March 24, 2000 and on June 2, 2000. The results of
operations for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2000
are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for the
full year. Certain amounts in prior years' financial statements and related
notes have been reclassified to conform to the 2000 presentation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the three-month
period ended September 30, 2000, approximately 60.4 million stock options with
exercise prices greater than the average market price of the underlying common
stock were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.

In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the three-month
period ended October 2, 1999, the assumed conversions of the zero coupon notes
due 2009 and 2013 were excluded because their inclusion would have been
antidilutive.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115, "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities", requires the carrying value
of available for sale securities to be adjusted to fair value. As such, the
Company recorded changes to investments, deferred income taxes and stockholders'
equity of an increase of $168 million, a decrease of $11 million and an increase
of $179 million, respectively, for the period ended September 30, 2000; and an
increase to investments, deferred income taxes and stockholders' equity of $5.5
billion, $2.2 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, for the period ended
December 31, 1999.

At December 31, 1999, the Company's investment in Broadcom Corporation carried
certain restrictions related to the sale of the securities. Such restrictions
did not lapse until April 2000. Accordingly, at December 31, 1999, the Company
carried this investment at its cost of $22 million and did not record a fair
value adjustment at that time.

3.  Reorganization of Businesses - 1997 Programs

During 1997, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $327 million
resulting from decisions to exit three unprofitable businesses that no longer
had long-term strategic value to the Company. As of December 31, 1999, the
business exits from the dynamic random access memory market and the retail
analog modem business had been completed. For the exit from the MacOS(R)-
compatible computer systems business, $2 million was utilized during the first
nine months of 2000 for contractual and warranty payments. The remaining $11
million accrual as of September 30, 2000, relates to contractual commitments and
warranty liability and may extend past the 2000 year end.

4.  Segment Information

Beginning with the first quarter of 2000, the Company added two operating
segments for financial reporting purposes. The Broadband Communications Segment
combines the operations of General Instrument Corporation with the existing
cable modem and telephony business of the Company's Internet and Networking
Group, which is part of the Other Products Segment. The Integrated Electronic
Systems Sector, which was previously included in the Other Products Segment, is
now reported as a separate segment. Historical segment data has been restated to
reflect these changes.

During the third quarter of 2000, the Network Systems Segment changed its name
to the Global Telecom Solutions Segment. This was only a name change, and there
have been no changes to the financial information.

Summarized below are the Company's segment sales and operating profit (loss)
before taxes by new reportable segment for the three months ended September 30,
2000, and October 2, 1999.

5.  Commitments and Contingencies

Iridium Program
- ---------------

At September 30, 2000, the Company owned, directly and indirectly, approximately
18% of the equity interests in Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries
(Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries are collectively referred to as
"Iridium") and a significant portion of a series of Iridium bonds. Since August
1999, Iridium has operated as debtors-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Federal Bankruptcy Code. On March 17, 2000, Iridium began the process of winding
down and liquidating its operations because no qualified bid to purchase the
Iridium satellites was timely received. At the same time, the Company began the
process of finalizing a plan for the decommissioning of the Iridium
constellation and continued with the process of shutting down its Iridium-
related operations.

On October 26, 2000, Iridium Satellite LLC, a newly formed entity, submitted a
bid to the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York
to acquire the assets of Iridium. A hearing has been scheduled for November 8,
2000, for the bankruptcy court to approve this bid. If so approved, the terms of
the bid currently provide that the acquisition should be completed no later than
November 30, 2000.

The Company had several contracts with Iridium, primarily for the operation and
maintenance of the global personal communications system. The Company stopped
recognizing revenue on the operations and maintenance contract with Iridium
after the second quarter of 1999, and continued to perform its services under
that contract throughout 1999 without being paid, although the Company has not
waived its right to receive payment. Although not contractually required to do
so, the Company is continuing to operate the Iridium system without
compensation. The Company currently expects to continue operating the system
only until Iridium Satellite LLC acquires Iridium's assets or until a plan to
decommission the Iridium constellation is finalized. The Company currently
expects to continue to perform some services without compensation during this
period, although it has not waived its right to seek compensation.

At December 31, 1999 the Company had $1.8 billion of reserves related to the
Iridium program. There have been no charges recorded in 2000 related to the
Iridium program. In the third quarter of 1999 the Company recorded a special
charge of $994 million (i) to increase its reserve related to its financial
exposure to the Iridium project to a level consistent with its expectation of
Chapter 11 financial restructuring of Iridium and (ii) to write down the
remaining value of the Iridium bonds it held.

The following table displays a rollforward by category from December 31, 1999 to
September 30, 2000, of the remaining accrual balances:

                                     ======     ========    ======      ======

Through September 30, 2000 the Company utilized $1.4 billion of reserves
including $661 million for accounts receivable write-offs and $732 million
primarily for inventory and other asset write-offs. The total amount used
through September 30, 2000 of $1.4 billion reflects approximately $155 million
in cash payments and $1.2 billion in write-offs. The cash payments were
primarily for costs associated with the wind-down of Iridium operations and
Iridium gateway debt guarantees. Of the remaining $405 million accrual balance
as of September 30, 2000, the Company expects to make approximately $318 million
in cash payments and $87 million in write-offs. There were no reserves used in
the first three quarters of 1999.

The reserve related to the Iridium program as of September 30, 2000 was $405
million, of which $282 million was included in accrued liabilities, $53 million
was included as a contra asset, in inventories, $45 million was included as a
contra asset, in property, plant and equipment, and $25 million was included as
a contra asset, in other assets. The development and commercialization reserve
as of December 31, 1999 was $1.8 billion, of which $869 million was included in
accrued liabilities, $734 million was included as a contra asset, in
inventories, $79 million was included as a contra asset, in property, plant and
equipment, $72 million was included as a contra asset, in other assets, $39
million was included in other liabilities, $4 million was included in accounts
payable, and $1 million was included as a contra asset, in accounts receivable,
in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. These reserves are believed by
management to be sufficient to cover the Company's Iridium exposures. These
reserves do not include additional special charges that may arise as a result of
litigation related to the Iridium project.

The Company had agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding to provide a
guarantee of up to an additional $350 million of Iridium debt for Iridium's use,
subject to certain conditions. Iridium requested Motorola to provide this
guarantee during the third quarter of 1999, however, Motorola believes it was
not obligated to do so. In certain circumstances and subject to certain
conditions, $300 million of such guarantee could have been required to be used
to guarantee amounts borrowed under the Secured Credit Agreement. The lenders
under the Secured Credit Agreement asserted that Iridium failed to have the
Company provide such guarantee as required, and that the Company was obligated
to provide them with this $300 million guarantee. The Company believes that it
was not obligated to do so. Iridium has also stated that it believed it was not
obligated to have the Company provide this $300 million guarantee to these
lenders. On June 9, 2000, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the agent under the Secured
Credit

                                      14
<PAGE>

Agreement, filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New
York County, demanding that Motorola pay this $300 million to Chase plus
interest and legal fees. The lenders under the Secured Credit Agreement have
also demanded that the investors in Iridium comply with their capital call
requirements. In the Company's case, this could require an additional equity
investment of $50 million. On June 9, 2000, the Chase Manhattan Bank also filed
a complaint in the U.S. District Court in the District of Delaware demanding
that Motorola and other investors in Iridium LLC pay their capital call
requirements, plus interest and legal fees.

Creditors and other stakeholders in Iridium may seek to bring various other
claims against the Company, with respect to payments previously made by Iridium
to the Company, and otherwise. A number of purported class action lawsuits
alleging securities law violations have been filed naming Iridium, certain
current and former officers of Iridium, other entities and the Company as
defendants.

For the three-month period ended September 30, 2000, the Company recorded a $4
million acquired in-process research and development charge for the acquisition
of Hiware AG. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2000, the Company
recorded a total of approximately $319 million in acquired in-process research
and development charges. These charges were recorded in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of
earnings. The Company incurred $49 million in acquired in-process research and
development charges during the three-month and nine-month periods ended October
2, 1999.

For each acquisition, the in-process research and development will have no
alternative future uses if the products are not feasible. Historical pricing,
margins and expense levels, where applicable, were used in the valuation of the
in-process products. The allocation of value to in-process research and
development was determined using expected future cash flows discounted at
average risk adjusted rates reflecting both technological and market risk as
well as the time value of money.

In addition to the acquired in-process research and development charges, the
acquisitions above resulted in a total of approximately $422 million in goodwill
and other intangibles which are to be amortized over periods ranging from 3 to
10 years on a straight-line basis. The goodwill and other intangibles were
recorded in other assets in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The acquisitions of Hiware AG, C-Port Corporation, Clinical Micro Sensors, Inc.
and WaveMark Technologies, Inc. were accounted for under the purchase method and
accordingly, the results of operations for each acquiree have been included in
the Company's consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
The pro forma effects of these acquisitions on the Company's financial
statements were not significant.

The Company made no significant acquisitions during the third quarter of 2000.

Following is information relating to significant pending transactions of the
Company:

Printrak International - Pending Transaction
- --------------------------------------------

In August 2000, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Printrak
International Inc., a publicly traded Anaheim, CA-based company, for
approximately $160 million in cash. Printrak is a worldwide supplier of
enterprise software and related services for information management and decision
support targeted at national, state and local governmental and civil agencies.
This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Propel - Pending Transaction
- ----------------------------

In October 2000, the Company reached a definitive agreement to sell four
cellular telephone operating companies in Northern Mexico to Telefonica Moviles
of Madrid. In addition, agreements have been reached to sell the Company's
interests in wireless communications businesses in Brazil,

                                      16
<PAGE>

Israel, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Southern Mexico (Portatel). The
finalization of these transactions is subject to rights of first refusal of
other shareholders in these businesses.

In the event that all of these transactions are completed, the total sales price
is expected to be approximately $2.65 billion, subject to adjustment, which may
be paid in cash or a slightly higher amount in shares of Telefonica, S.A.

All transactions are subject to customary regulatory approvals.  If these and
other conditions are met, all transactions are currently expected to be
completed in 2001.

In June 2000, the Company caused its wholly owned subsidiary, Propel, Inc., to
file a registration statement with the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC)
for a public offering of up to 20% of Propel's common stock.  In light of the
pending transaction with Telefonica Moviles, Propel's public offering process is
currently on hold.  In the event that the wireless communications businesses
described above are sold to Telefonica Moviles, Propel would not complete its
public offering.

7.  Charges for Discontinuation of Product Lines and Business Exits

Discontinuation of Product Lines

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company implemented a plan to discontinue
unprofitable product lines, primarily analog wireless telephone products and
certain 5-inch and 6-inch wafer technologies.  As a result, the Company recorded
in the third quarter of 2000 a special charge of $570 million, of which $428
million was included in manufacturing and other costs of sales and $142 million
was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statements of earnings.  The $570 million charge was comprised of
$413 million in inventory writedowns, $142 million in capital asset writedowns,
and $15 million in exit costs.

This plan impacted the Personal Communications, Global Telecom Solutions,
Semiconductor Products, and Integrated Electronic Systems segments.  The
following table displays by segment the charges incurred for inventory
writedowns, capital asset writedowns, and exit costs:

<TABLE>

- --------------------------     ----        ----      ----   ----
</TABLE>

The inventory writedowns were recorded to reflect the discontinued product lines
at net realizable value.  The capital asset writedowns were recorded to reflect
the impairment of two semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Arizona and
Texas and machinery and equipment.  The impairment for these assets was based
upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of
the assets.  The impairment charge was calculated

                                       17
<PAGE>

using discounted cash flows. The exit costs were recorded in conjunction with
the two semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities. These costs included site
and equipment decontamination costs and equipment, chemical, and gas line
removal costs. As of September 30, 2000, the $15 million accrual, included in
accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, had not yet
been utilized and represented cash payments to be made in 2001.

Business Exit and Realignments

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company implemented a plan to exit an
unprofitable business and realign the operations of two other businesses.  The
unprofitable business is the Company's joint venture with Cisco Systems, Inc. in
SpectraPoint Wireless LLC (SpectraPoint).  The realignment of operations relates
to the Company's multi-network service business (MND) and the European and Latin
American locations of the global market and sales organization.  As a result of
this plan, the Company recorded in the third quarter of 2000 a special charge of
$149 million, of which $71 million was included in manufacturing and other costs
of sales and $78 million was included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.  The $149 million
charge was comprised of $42 million in exit costs, $26 million in employee
separation costs, $45 million in inventory writedowns, and $36 million in asset
writedowns.

This plan impacted the Global Telecom Solutions; Commercial, Government, and
Industrial Systems; and Other Products segments.  The following table displays
by segment the charges incurred for exit costs, employee separation costs,
inventory writedowns, and asset writedowns:

</TABLE>

Exit costs primarily include customer and supplier termination costs and lease
payment and cancellation costs.  Employee separation costs represent the costs
of involuntary severance benefits for 520 positions in the impacted businesses.
As of September 30, 2000, approximately 190 employees have separated from the
Company.  The accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs are included
in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The
following table displays a rollforward of these accruals to September 30, 2000:

cash payments and $12 million in non-cash utilization and is expected to be
completely used in 2001.

The inventory writedowns were recorded to reflect the SpectraPoint and MND
inventory at net realizable value.  The asset writedowns were for the capital
assets used in the manufacture of SpectraPoint and MND products and for the
writeoff of the SpectraPoint goodwill.

8. Trust Originated Preferred Securities/SM/

In February 1999, Motorola Capital Trust I, a Delaware statutory business trust
and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "Trust"), sold Trust Originated
Preferred Securities/SM/ ("TOPrS") to the public at an aggregate offering price
of $500 million. The Trust used the proceeds from this sale, together with the
proceeds from its sale of common stock to the Company, to buy a series of 6.68%
Deferrable Interest Junior Subordinated Debentures due March 31, 2039
("Subordinated Debentures") from the Company with the same payment terms as the
TOPrS. The sole assets of the Trust are the Subordinated Debentures. The TOPrS
are shown as "Company-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of
subsidiary trust holding solely company-guaranteed debentures" in the Company's
consolidated financial statements.

The Company's obligations relating to the TOPrS include obligations to make
payments on the Subordinated Debentures and obligations under the related
Indenture, Trust Guarantee and Declaration of Trust.  Taken together, these
obligations represent a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due under
the TOPrS.

/SM/ "Trust Originated Preferred Securities" and "TOPrS" are service marks of
Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.

                     Management's Discussion and Analysis
               of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

On January 5, 2000, Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") completed its previously
announced merger with General Instrument Corporation ("General Instrument") by
exchanging 301 million shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 common
stock split described below) of its common stock for all of the common stock of
General Instrument.  Each share of General Instrument was exchanged for 1.725
shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 common stock split described
below) of Motorola's common stock.  Motorola has accounted for the merger as a
pooling-of-interests and accordingly, all prior period consolidated financial
statements of Motorola have been restated to include the results of operations,
financial position and cash flows of General Instrument.  From this point
onward, all references to Motorola, Inc. or the Company reflect the pooling-of-
interests.

On June 1, 2000, the Company had a 3-for-1 common stock split in the form of a
200% stock dividend.  On that date, the Company distributed 1.4 billion common
shares to stockholders of record on May 15, 2000.  The par value of the common
stock remained at $3 per share.  All historical information has been restated to
reflect the stock split.

This commentary should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated
financial statements and related notes thereto and management's discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations incorporated by
reference in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1999, as
supplemented by Form 8-K/As filed on March 24, 2000 and on June 2, 2000.

</TABLE>

Sales were $9.5 billion in the third quarter of 2000, up 15 percent from $8.2
billion a year earlier. Sales growth was attributed primarily to a very
significant increase in sales of internet protocol (IP) network and digital
network systems and continuing increases in sales of terrestrial infrastructure
equipment and semiconductor products.

Third-quarter 2000 net earnings were $531 million, or 23 cents per share,
compared with third-quarter 1999 net earnings of $114 million, or 5 cents per
share. Net margin on sales was 6 percent in the third quarter of 2000 compared
with 1 percent a year earlier.

Manufacturing margin in the third quarter of 2000 decreased to 35 percent from
36 percent a year earlier, attributable in part to special inventory writedowns.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 8 percent of sales
compared to 16 percent a year earlier. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses is primarily attributable to $673 million of Iridium
charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses during third
quarter 1999. There were no Iridium related expenses incurred during the third
quarter of 2000. The gains from the sale of investments reflected in selling,
general and administrative expenses for each period were comparable.

Research and development expenditures increased 28 percent to $1.2 billion, or
12 percent of sales, in the third quarter of 2000 compared to $913 million, or
11 percent of sales, a year earlier. Over the past three years, the Company has
been increasing the percentage of its sales that is spent on research and
development. The Company continues to believe that a strong commitment to
research and development is required to drive long-

                                       21
<PAGE>

term growth. Research and development spending in 2000 is expected to continue
to increase at a rate higher than the rate of sales growth.

Depreciation expense in the third quarter of 2000 as a percentage of sales
decreased to 6 percent from 7 percent a year earlier. This decline was
attributable to the increase in sales, while depreciation expense remained
fairly constant. Depreciation expense for 2000 is expected to increase, but at a
rate below the expected rate of sales growth.

Interest expense increased versus a year ago to $74 million from $33 million due
to increased commercial paper and short-term borrowings. Interest expense for
the full year of 2000 is expected to increase at a rate greater than the
expected rate of sales growth.

The tax rate for the third quarter of 2000 was 30 percent, the same as the year-
earlier quarter. The Company had no significant non-deductible charges in the
third quarter of 2000 and 1999. The Company currently expects the annual tax
rate for 2000, excluding the impact of significant non-deductible charges, from
both prior and potential future acquisitions, to be 30 percent. This estimate is
based on current tax law, the current estimate of earnings and the expected
distribution of income among various tax jurisdictions.

Sales were $27.5 billion in the first nine months of 2000, up 15 percent from
$24.0 billion a year earlier. Sales growth was attributed primarily to a very
significant increase in sales of IP network and digital network systems and
continuing increases in sales of terrestrial infrastructure equipment,
semiconductor products and digital wireless telephones.

Earnings for the first nine months of 2000 were $1.2 billion, or 52 cents per
share, compared with earnings for the first nine months of 1999 of $568 million,
or 26 cents per share. Net margin on sales was 4 percent in the

                                      22

first nine months of 2000 compared with 2 percent for the first nine months of
1999. The increase in earnings for the first nine months of 2000 compared to the
first nine months of 1999 was attributed to: (i) increased sales, (ii) higher
operating margins in the global telecom solutions and broadband communications
businesses, and (iii) lower selling, general and administrative expenses. These
improvements were partially offset by an increase in research and development
expenditures and an increase in the effective tax rate.

Manufacturing margin for the first nine months of 2000 remained constant at 39
percent compared to the first nine months of 1999.

Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 13 percent of sales
compared to 18 percent a year earlier. The decrease in selling, general and
administrative expenses is primarily attributable to $921 million of Iridium
charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses during the
first nine months of 1999. There were no Iridium related expenses incurred
during the first nine months of 2000.

Research and development expenditures increased 30 percent to $3.3 billion, or
12 percent of sales, in the first nine months of 2000 compared to $2.5 billion,
or 11 percent of sales, a year earlier.

Depreciation expense in the first nine months of 2000 as a percentage of sales
decreased to 6 percent from 7 percent a year earlier. This decline was
attributable to the increase in sales, while depreciation expense remained
fairly constant.

Interest expense increased in the first nine months of 2000 versus a year ago to
$175 million from $118 million due to increased commercial paper and short-term
borrowings.

The tax rate for the first nine months of 2000 increased to 35 percent from 31
percent for the first nine months of 1999. The increased tax rate reflects the
impact of significant non-deductible charges for acquired in-process research
and development (IPR&D) from acquisitions completed in the second quarter of
2000. Excluding the impact of significant non-deductible charges for IPR&D, the
Company's effective income tax rate for the first nine months of 2000 was 30
percent. There were no significant non-deductible charges in the first nine
months of 1999.

In March of 2000, the Company completed the sale of Motorola Lighting, Inc. to
Osram Sylvania, the North American operation of Osram GmbH of Germany.  In 1999,
the Company sold several businesses, of which the sale of the Semiconductor
Components Group was the largest transaction.

Although excluding the results of these exited businesses has no impact on
results for the third quarter of 2000, their exclusion does impact the

year-earlier quarter. Excluding the results of these exited businesses, third-
quarter 2000 sales from ongoing businesses were $9.5 billion, up 18 percent from
$8.1 billion a year earlier. Excluding the results of exited businesses and net
special items, third-quarter 2000 earnings from ongoing businesses were $598

Charges for Discontinuation of Product Lines and Business Exits

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company implemented a plan to discontinue
unprofitable product lines, primarily analog wireless telephone products and
certain 5-inch and 6-inch wafer technologies.  As a result, the Company recorded
in the third quarter of 2000 a special charge of $570 million, of which $428
million was included in manufacturing and other costs of sales and $142 million
was included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statements of earnings.  The $570 million charge was comprised of
$413 million in inventory writedowns, $142 million in capital asset writedowns,
and $15 million in exit costs.

</TABLE>

The inventory writedowns were recorded to reflect the discontinued product lines
at net realizable value.  The capital asset writedowns were recorded to reflect
the impairment of two semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Arizona and
Texas and machinery and equipment.  The impairment for these assets was based
upon an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of
the assets.  The impairment charge was calculated using discounted cash flows.
The exit costs were recorded in conjunction with the two semiconductor wafer
fabrication facilities.  These costs included site and equipment decontamination
costs and equipment, chemical, and gas line removal costs.  As of September 30,
2000, the $15 million accrual, included in accrued liabilities in the condensed
consolidated balance sheets, had not yet been utilized and represented cash
payments to be made in 2001.

During the third quarter of 2000, the Company implemented a plan to exit an
unprofitable business and realign the operations of two other businesses.  The
unprofitable business is the Company's joint venture with Cisco Systems, Inc. in
SpectraPoint Wireless LLC (SpectraPoint).  The realignment of operations relates
to the Company's multi-network service business (MND) and the European and Latin
American locations of the global market and sales organization.  As a result of
this plan, the Company recorded in the third quarter of 2000 a special charge of
$149 million, of which $71 million was included in manufacturing and other costs
of sales and $78 million was included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.  The $149 million
charge was comprised of $42 million in exit costs, $26 million in employee
separation costs, $45 million in inventory writedowns, and $36 million in asset
writedowns.

This plan impacted the Global Telecom Solutions; Commercial, Government, and
Industrial Systems; and Other Products segments.  The following table displays
by segment the charges incurred for exit costs, employee separation costs,
inventory writedowns, and asset writedowns:

Exit costs primarily include customer and supplier termination costs and lease
payment and cancellation costs.  Employee separation costs represent the costs
of involuntary severance benefits for 520 positions in the impacted businesses.
As of September 30, 2000, approximately 190 employees have separated from the
Company.  The accruals for exit costs and employee separation costs are included
in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  The
following table displays a rollforward of these accruals to September 30, 2000:

The amount used of $23 million reflects actual cash payments.  The remaining
accrual of $45 million represents approximately $33 million in cash payments and
$12 million in non-cash utilization and is expected to be completely used in
2001.

The inventory writedowns were recorded to reflect the SpectraPoint and MND
inventory at net realizable value.  The asset writedowns were for the capital
assets used in the manufacture of SpectraPoint and MND products and for the
writeoff of the SpectraPoint goodwill.

1997 Restructuring Program
- --------------------------

During 1997, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $327 million
resulting from decisions to exit three unprofitable businesses that no longer
had long-term strategic value to the Company.  As of December 31, 1999, the
business exits from the dynamic random access memory market and the retail
analog modem business had been completed.  For the exit from the MacOS(R)-
compatible computer systems business, $2 million was utilized during the first
nine months of 2000 for contractual and warranty payments.  The remaining $11
million accrual as of September 30, 2000, relates to contractual commitments and
warranty liability and may extend past the 2000 year end.

</TABLE>

Segment sales rose 4 percent to $3.2 billion, and orders declined 23 percent to
$3.3 billion.  Customer concerns over supply shortages of wireless telephones
and many components used in their manufacture resulted in significant pre-
ordering in the year-earlier quarter.  These supply constraints are no longer a
factor.  As such, no significant pre-ordering occurred in the quarter resulting
in a decline in order growth when compared to the year-earlier quarter.

The segment had an operating loss of $197 million compared to an operating
profit of $133 million in the year-earlier quarter.  The decrease in operating
results was due to a net special charge of $382 million included in the
operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2000.  This net special
charge is comprised of a $388 million writedown of inventory and capital assets
related to analog wireless telephone products and a $6 million gain from the
sale of an investment.  In the condensed consolidated statements of earnings,
the writedown is included in manufacturing and other costs of sales, and the
gain from the sale of the investment is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses.  Evaluation of the segment's strategy to simplify its
product portfolio will continue in the fourth quarter and is expected to result
in a special charge in that quarter.  This charge is expected to be smaller than
the charge in the third quarter.  Included in the operating profits for the
three months ended October 2, 1999, is a net special charge of $7 million
comprised of a $10 million gain from the sale of an investment and a $17 million
charge related to Iridium.  This net special charge is included in selling,
general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of
earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits rose 32 percent to $185 million
compared to $140 million a year ago.  An increase in sales of digital wireless
telephones contributed to the improved operating results.  Operating margin
increased to 6 percent of sales compared with 5 percent of sales in the year-
earlier quarter.

The segment's results were not impacted by sold businesses.  Therefore, for
ongoing businesses, sales, orders and operating profits excluding net special
items were unchanged from the data shown in the table above.

In the wireless telephone business, which includes iDEN(R) phones, sales
increased 6 percent, orders were down, and operating profits were lower.  Sales
increased significantly in the Americas, were higher in Asia and

                                       30
<PAGE>

decreased significantly in Europe. Orders were higher in Asia, lower in the
Americas and very significantly lower in Europe. Results in the European region
were negatively impacted by the weakening Euro and very high penetration rates
resulting in slower growth in new subscribers. Digital wireless telephone sales
represented approximately 98 percent of phone sales in the quarter.

Digital phone unit sales increased by approximately 38 percent in the third
quarter versus a year ago.  Versus the year ago quarter, unit sales for (i)
Global System for Mobile (GSM) products increased by almost 30 percent; (ii)
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) products increased approximately 25
percent; (iii) Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) products increased by over
300 percent; and (iv) iDEN(R) phones increased approximately 50 percent.  Analog
wireless telephone unit sales decreased approximately 80 percent from a year
ago.  Including the very significant decline in analog wireless telephone unit
sales, total unit sales of wireless telephones increased by approximately 15
percent from a year ago.

The overall average selling price for digital phones declined approximately 10
percent versus a year ago.  The overall average selling price for analog phones
increased about 15 percent versus a year ago.  Average selling prices can be
subject to changes in product mix and regional mix.

Sales and orders for paging products were lower than a year ago due to fewer
unit sales.  By region, sales were lower in the Americas and significantly lower
in Europe and Asia.  Orders were lower in Europe and significantly lower in the
Americas and Asia.

Segment sales rose 23 percent to $2.0 billion, and orders increased 21 percent
to $1.8 billion.  The segment had an operating profit of $136 million compared
to an operating loss of $639 million in the year-earlier quarter.  Included in
operating profits for the three months ended September 30, 2000, is a $111
million charge comprised of a $15 million writedown of inventory related to the
wireless access systems business and a $96 million charge for business exit
costs, inventory writedowns, and asset writedowns related to the exit from the
SpectraPoint Wireless joint venture with Cisco Systems, Inc.  Of the $111
million special charge, $67 million is included in manufacturing and other costs
of sales, and $44 million is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.  Included in the
operating

loss for the three months ended October 2, 1999, is a special charge of $825
million comprised of an $811 million charge related to Iridium and a $14 million
acquired in-process research and development charge for the acquisition of
SpectraPoint Wireless. Of the $825 million special charge, $321 million relates
to inventory writedowns for Iridium and is included in manufacturing and other
costs of sales, and $504 million is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits increased 33 percent to $247
million compared to $186 million a year ago due primarily to the continuing
increase in terrestrial infrastructure equipment sales.

The segment's results were not impacted by sold businesses.  Therefore, for
ongoing businesses, sales, orders and operating profits excluding net special
items were unchanged from the data shown in the table above.

Sales and orders for the three months ended September 30, 2000, and October 2,
1999, are no longer affected by any satellite communications business.  By
region, sales were up significantly in the Americas, up in Europe, and up in
Asia.  Orders were up significantly in the Americas, up in Asia, and down in
Europe.  Sales of iDEN(R) infrastructure equipment were up very significantly
versus a year ago.  Sales of GSM and CDMA infrastructure equipment increased.
PDC sales in Japan were very significantly higher.  Analog sales were zero.

On October 6, 2000, the Company and Teledesic LLC mutually agreed to terminate
their contract for the design and construction of a satellite communications
network.  However, the Company remains an investor in Teledesic LLC.

Segment sales rose 47 percent to $917 million, and orders increased 41 percent
to $941 million. Operating profits increased to $757 million from $53 million
in the year-earlier quarter. Included in operating profits for the three months
ended September 30, 2000, is a net special gain of $603 million. This net
special gain is comprised of a $695 million gain from the sale of an
investment, an $87 million charge for the settlement of the Gemstar-TV Guide
International, Inc. (Gemstar) litigation, and a $5 million charge for
integration costs from the General Instrument merger. Included in operating
profits for the three months ended October 2, 1999 is a net special charge of
$24 million. This net special charge is comprised of a $43 million charge
related to an American Arbitration Association panel's interim decision in the
breach of contract dispute with Gemstar and a $19 million gain from the sale of
investments. These special items are included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits rose 100 percent to $154 million
compared to $77 million a year ago due to increases in sales, primarily in the
IP Network Systems and Digital Network Systems businesses, and from benefits
resulting from the synergies achieved through the merger with General
Instrument.

The segment's results were not impacted by sold businesses. Therefore, for
ongoing businesses, sales, orders and operating profits excluding net special
items were unchanged from the data shown in the table above.

Sales were up very significantly in the IP Network Systems and Digital Network
Systems businesses. They were higher in the Satellite Network Systems business
and lower in the Transmission Network Systems business.

Orders were up very significantly in the IP Network Systems and Digital Network
Systems businesses. They were up significantly in the Satellite Network Systems
business and lower in the Transmission Network Systems business.

By region, North America accounted for approximately 83 percent of the segment's
total sales and 85 percent of the segment's total orders. Sales and order growth
for this region were 42 percent and 39 percent, respectively, compared to 80
percent and 48 percent, respectively, for the international markets.

In July 2000, the Company purchased the assets of Zenith Electronics
Corporation's Network Systems division for approximately $15 million in cash.

Segment sales increased 21 percent to $2.1 billion, and orders increased 12
percent to $2.2 billion.  Operating profits decreased to $68 million from $406
million in the year-earlier quarter.  Included in operating profits for the
three months ended September 30, 2000, is a net special charge of $122 million.
This net special charge is comprised of a $1 million writedown of an investment,
a $4 million acquired in-process research and development charge related to the
acquisition of Hiware AG, a $23 million gain from the sale of an investment, and
a $140 million charge for capital asset writedowns and business exit costs for
two semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Arizona and Texas.  The net
special charge is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in
the condensed

consolidated statements of earnings. Included in operating profits for the three
months ended October 2, 1999, is a net special gain of $325 million. This net
special gain is comprised of a $35 million acquired in-process research and
development charge related to the acquisition of Metrowerks and a $360 million
gain from the sale of the Semiconductor Components Group. The net special gain
is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed
consolidated statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits rose 135 percent to $190 million
compared to $81 million a year ago primarily due to an increase in operating
margin resulting from the impact of restructuring programs undertaken over the
past few years, including the exit of low growth or unprofitable businesses, the
consolidation of manufacturing facilities and the reduction of employees. These
restructuring programs included the strategic decision to focus the business on
high-growth end markets and to emphasize systems-on-chip solutions, providing
opportunities to reap the benefits of higher gross margins from value-added
hardware, software and services.

For ongoing businesses, sales rose 30 percent to $2.1 billion from $1.6 billion,
and orders increased 19 percent to $2.2 billion. Operating profits for ongoing
businesses excluding net special items increased to $190 million from $60
million in the year-earlier quarter. The increase in profits for ongoing
businesses excluding net special items is primarily the result of the factors
discussed above and an increase in sales driven partially by the growth of
worldwide semiconductor demand.

By region, sales were up very significantly in Asia and higher in Europe and the
Americas. Orders were up significantly in Asia and higher in Europe and the
Americas. By end market, sales were up very significantly in networking and
computing, were up significantly in wireless and in standard embedded solutions,
and were higher in transportation and in imaging and entertainment. Orders,
which increased in all end markets, were up very significantly in networking and
computing and were higher in wireless, in standard embedded solutions, in
transportation, and in imaging and entertainment.

In July 2000, the Company acquired Hiware AG (Hiware) for approximately $11
million in cash. Headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, Hiware is a leading
provider of development tools for the automotive and industrial automation
industries focusing primarily on 8- and 16-bit processor architectures.

Segment sales rose 11 percent to $737 million, and orders increased 9 percent to
$781 million. Operating profits decreased to $14 million from $50 million in the
year-earlier quarter primarily due to a net special charge of $31 million. This
net special charge is comprised of a net $4 million loss on the sale of
investments and businesses and a $27 million writedown of battery inventory and
equipment related to analog wireless telephone products. Of the $31 million net
special charge, $6 million is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses, and $25 million is included in manufacturing and other costs of sales
in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

Excluding net special items, operating profits decreased to $45 million compared
to $50 million a year ago due to lower sales in the automotive and industrial
electronics and in the energy systems businesses. However, these lower sales
were partially offset by significantly higher sales in the computer and in the
telematics communications businesses.

For ongoing businesses, sales increased 17 percent to $737 million compared to
$631 million in the year-earlier quarter. Orders increased 15 percent to $781
million. Operating profits for ongoing businesses excluding net special items
decreased 13 percent from $52 million in the year-earlier quarter.

Other Products
- --------------

In the third quarter of 2000, the Company incurred a net special charge of $40
million comprised of a $7 million gain from the sale of an investment and a $47
million charge for business exit costs, inventory writedowns, and asset
writedowns related to the multi-service networks business. Of the $40 million
net special charge, $24 million is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses, and $16 million is included in manufacturing and other
costs of sales in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

In the third quarter of 1999, the Company incurred a special charge of $166
million related to Iridium. This special item was included in selling, general
and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of
earnings.

General Corporate
- -----------------

In the third quarter of 2000, the Company incurred a special charge of $6
million from the sale of a building in Brazil. This special charge is included
in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated
statements of earnings.

In the third quarter of 1999, the Company sold 2.8 million shares of Nextel
common stock, and Digital Radio LLC exercised options to purchase an additional
2 million shares of Nextel common stock the Company held. These two transactions
resulted in a $118 million gain which is included in selling, general and
administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of earnings.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:
- --------------------------------

Cash and cash equivalents aggregated $2.8 billion as of September 30, 2000,
compared to $3.5 billion as of October 2, 1999.

Net cash used by operations was $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September
30, 2000, as compared to $2.0 billion in cash provided by operations for the
nine months ended October 2, 1999.  The change in the cash flow from operations
was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable in the Personal
Communications and Global Telecom Solutions segments, an increase in inventory
in the Personal Communications Segment, and a decrease in accounts payable and
accrued liabilities.

Net cash used by investing activities was $2.3 billion for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000, as compared to $233 million in cash provided by
investing activities for the nine months ended October 2, 1999.  The increase in
cash used by investing activities for the first nine months of 2000 compared to
the first nine months of 1999 was primarily due to increased capital
expenditures.  Capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2000 aggregated
$2.8 billion, as compared to $1.6 billion for the first nine months of 1999.  Of
these expenditures, approximately $1.7 billion and $815 million, respectively,
were spent in the Semiconductor Products Segment.  For 2000, total capital
expenditures are expected to be $4.6 billion, of which $2.6 billion is expected
to be spent in the Semiconductor Products Segment, compared to $2.9 billion in
1999.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, the Company received $1.1
billion in proceeds from the sale of investments.  The Company utilized these
proceeds for acquisitions and additional investments during the period of $1.1
billion.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.9 billion for the nine months
ended September 30, 2000, as compared to $266 million cash used for financing
activities for the nine months ended October 2, 1999.  The increase in cash from
financing activities for the first nine months of 2000 compared to the first
nine months of 1999 was primarily due to $2.8 billion in proceeds from
commercial paper and short-term borrowings to meet the increase in cash needs
from operations primarily related to working capital.  The Company's ratio of
net debt to net debt plus equity was 22.1 percent at September 30, 2000 compared
to 8.2 percent at December 31, 1999.

The Company's total domestic and non-U.S. credit facilities were $4.2 billion at
September 30, 2000, of which $275 million was used.  The remaining $3.9 billion,
together with available cash and cash equivalents and other sources of
liquidity, was available to support outstanding commercial paper that totaled
$5.3 billion.

Some purchasers of the Company's infrastructure equipment continue to require
suppliers to provide financing in connection with equipment purchases.
Financing may include all or a portion of the purchase price and working
capital.  The Company may also assist customers in obtaining financing from
banks and other sources.  As the Company seeks to obtain contracts to provide
infrastructure equipment for third-generation (3G) wireless networks, there is a
likelihood that the Company will provide an increased amount of financing in
connection with some of these contracts.

                                       37
<PAGE>

At September 30, 2000, the Company's aggregate commitment to provide financing
to third party vendors was $3.8 billion, of which $2.8 billion had been
utilized.

At September 30, 2000, the Company's commitment for off-balance sheet third-
party financial guarantees aggregated $691 million, of which $516 million had
been utilized.

The Company's aggregate commitments represent the maximum amounts available.
Present and future commitments may not be completely utilized.

The Company believes that it can continue to access the capital markets in 2000,
if necessary, on acceptable terms and conditions.  However, factors outside of
the Company's control, such as the liquidity of the capital markets, may affect
the Company's ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms.

Return on average invested capital, based on the performance of the four
preceding quarters ending with September 30, 2000, was 7.9 percent, compared
with 4.6 percent based on the performance of the four preceding quarters ending
October 2, 1999.  The Company's current ratio, weeks receivable, and inventory
turns (using the cost-of-sales calculation method) were 1.26, 8.6, and 5.3,
respectively, at September 30, 2000, compared to 1.36, 7.7, and 5.9,
respectively, at December 31, 1999.

Iridium Program
- ---------------

At September 30, 2000, the Company owned, directly and indirectly, approximately
18% of the equity interests in Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries
(Iridium LLC and its operating subsidiaries are collectively referred to as
"Iridium") and a significant portion of a series of Iridium bonds.  Since August
1999, Iridium has operated as debtors-in-possession under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Federal Bankruptcy Code.  On March 17, 2000, Iridium began the process of
winding down and liquidating its operations because no qualified bid to purchase
the Iridium satellites was timely received.  At the same time, the Company began
the process of finalizing a plan for the decommissioning of the Iridium
constellation and continued with the process of shutting down its Iridium-
related operations.

On October 26, 2000, Iridium Satellite LLC, a newly formed entity, submitted a
bid to the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York
to acquire the assets of Iridium.  A hearing has been scheduled for November 8,
2000, for the bankruptcy court to approve this bid. If so approved, the terms of
the bid currently provide that the acquisition should be completed no later than
November 30, 2000.

The Company had several contracts with Iridium, primarily for the operation and
maintenance of the global personal communications system.  The Company stopped
recognizing revenue on the operations and maintenance contract with Iridium
after the second quarter of 1999, and continued to perform its services under
that contract throughout 1999 without being paid, although the Company has not
waived its right to receive payment.  Although not contractually required to do
so, the Company is continuing to operate the Iridium system without
compensation. The Company currently expects to continue operating the system
only until Iridium Satellite LLC acquires Iridium's assets or until a plan to
decommission the Iridium constellation is finalized.  The Company currently
expects to continue to perform some

                                       38
<PAGE>

services without compensation during this period, although it has not waived its
right to seek compensation.

At December 31, 1999 the Company had $1.8 billion of reserves related to the
Iridium program.  There have been no charges recorded in 2000 related to the
Iridium program.  In the third quarter of 1999 the Company recorded a special
charge of $994 million (i) to increase its reserve related to its financial
exposure to the Iridium project to a level consistent with its expectation of
Chapter 11 financial restructuring of Iridium and (ii) to write down the
remaining value of the Iridium bonds it held.

The following table displays a rollforward by category from December 31, 1999 to
September 30, 2000, of the remaining accrual balances:

</TABLE>

Through September 30, 2000 the Company utilized $1.4 billion of reserves
including $661 million for accounts receivable write-offs and $732 million
primarily for inventory and other asset write-offs.  The total amount used
through September 30, 2000 of $1.4 billion reflects approximately $155 million
in cash payments and $1.2 billion in write-offs.  The cash payments were
primarily for costs associated with the wind-down of Iridium operations and
Iridium gateway debt guarantees.  Of the remaining $405 million accrual balance
as of September 30, 2000, the Company expects to make approximately $318 million
in cash payments and $87 million in write-offs.  There were no reserves used in
the first three quarters of 1999.

The reserve related to the Iridium program as of September 30, 2000 was $405
million, of which $282 million was included in accrued liabilities, $53 million
was included as a contra asset, in inventories, $45 million was included as a
contra asset, in property, plant and equipment, and $25 million was included as
a contra asset, in other assets.  The development and commercialization reserve
as of December 31, 1999 was $1.8 billion, of which $869 million was included in
accrued liabilities, $734 million was included as a contra asset, in
inventories, $79 million was included as a contra asset, in property, plant and
equipment, $72 million was included as a contra asset, in other assets, $39
million was included in other liabilities, $4 million was included in accounts
payable, and $1 million was included as a contra asset, in accounts receivable,
in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  These reserves are believed by
management to be sufficient to cover the Company's Iridium exposures.  These
reserves do not include additional special charges that may arise as a result of
litigation related to the Iridium project.

                                       39

The Company had agreed under a Memorandum of Understanding to provide a
guarantee of up to an additional $350 million of Iridium debt for Iridium's use,
subject to certain conditions.  Iridium requested Motorola to provide this
guarantee during the third quarter of 1999, however, Motorola believes it was
not obligated to do so.  In certain circumstances and subject to certain
conditions, $300 million of such guarantee could have been required to be used
to guarantee amounts borrowed under the Secured Credit Agreement.  The lenders
under the Secured Credit Agreement asserted that Iridium failed to have the
Company provide such guarantee as required, and that the Company was obligated
to provide them with this $300 million guarantee.  The Company believes that it
was not obligated to do so.  Iridium has also stated that it believed it was not
obligated to have the Company provide this $300 million guarantee to these
lenders.  On June 9, 2000, the Chase Manhattan Bank, the agent under the Secured
Credit Agreement, filed a complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County, demanding that Motorola pay this $300 million to Chase
plus interest and legal fees.  The lenders under the Secured Credit Agreement
have also demanded that the investors in Iridium comply with their capital call
requirements.  In the Company's case, this could require an additional equity
investment of $50 million.  On June 9, 2000, the Chase Manhattan Bank also filed
a complaint in the U.S. District Court in the District of Delaware demanding
that Motorola and other investors in Iridium LLC pay their capital call
requirements, plus interest and legal fees.

Creditors and other stakeholders in Iridium may seek to bring various other
claims against the Company, with respect to payments previously made by Iridium
to the Company, and otherwise.  A number of purported class action lawsuits
alleging securities law violations have been filed naming Iridium, certain
current and former officers of Iridium, other entities and the Company as
defendants.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these
matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations.

Risk Management
- ---------------

As a multinational company, the Company's transactions are denominated in a
variety of currencies.  The Company uses financial instruments to hedge, and
therefore attempts to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency
fluctuations on cash flows.  The Company's policy is not to speculate in
financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation, trade
in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or enter into trades
for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.  Instruments
used as hedges must be effective at reducing the risk associated with the
exposure being hedged and must be designated as a hedge at the inception of the
contract.  Accordingly, changes in market values of hedge instruments must be
highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both
at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.

The Company's strategy in foreign exchange exposure issues is to offset the
gains or losses of the financial instruments against losses or gains on the
underlying operational cash flows or investments based on the operating business
units' assessment of risk.  Currently, the Company primarily hedges firm
commitments, including assets and liabilities currently on the balance sheet.
The Company expects that it may hedge anticipated

                                       40
<PAGE>

transactions, forecasted transactions or investments in foreign subsidiaries in
the future.

Almost all of the Company's non-functional currency receivables and payables
which are denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open markets are
hedged.  The Company uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency
exposures.  A portion of the Company's exposure is to currencies which are not
traded on open markets, such as those in Latin America, and these are addressed,
to the extent reasonably possible, through managing net asset positions, product
pricing, and other means, such as component sourcing.

At September 30, 2000 and October 2, 1999, the Company had net outstanding
foreign exchange contracts totaling $4.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.
Management believes that these financial instruments should not subject the
Company to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses
on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities,
and transactions being hedged.  At September 30, 2000, deferred gains totaled

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses if counterparties to financial
instruments fail to perform their obligations.  However, it does not expect any
counterparties, which presently have high credit ratings, to fail to meet their
obligations.

In June 1999, the Company's finance subsidiary entered into interest rate swaps
to change the characteristics of the interest rate payments on its $500 million
6.75% Guaranteed Bonds due 2004 from fixed-rate payments to short-term LIBOR
based variable rate payments in order to match the funding with its underlying
assets.  Except for these interest rate swaps, as of the end of the reporting
period, the Company had no outstanding commodity derivatives, currency swaps or
options relating to either its debt instruments or investments.  The Company
does not have any derivatives to hedge the value of its equity investments in
affiliated companies.

Euro Conversion:
- ----------------

On January 1, 1999, the Euro was created and eleven of the fifteen member
countries of the European Union (EU) established fixed conversion rates between
their existing national currencies and the Euro.  The participating countries
adopted the Euro as their common legal currency on that date.  In June 2000,
Greece became the twelfth EU country to adopt the Euro.  Until January 1, 2002,
either the Euro or a participating country's present currency (a `national
currency') will be accepted as legal currency.  On or

                                       41
<PAGE>

before January 1, 2002, Euro-denominated notes and coins will begin to be issued
and national currencies will start to be withdrawn from circulation.

The Company has established a Euro project plan with two phases. Each business
segment is responsible for following this plan, and internal audit is reviewing
progress against established milestones. Phase I of the plan was to enable the
Company to be `Euro-capable', meaning able to process Euro transactions and
comply with all relevant EU and national regulations. This was accomplished by
January 1, 1999 by all business segments. Phase II of the plan is intended to
enable all Motorola businesses in Europe to become `Euro-functional', meaning
that the functional currency used by the businesses in relevant countries will
be the Euro. Completion of Phase II has been targeted for January 1, 2001, with
the exception of 2 business units that are targeting completion by July 1, 2001
and certain HR-related functions that will convert with the introduction of the
Euro on January 1, 2002.

The Company will continue to evaluate the issues relating to the Euro
conversion. However, based on its work to date, the Company believes that the
introduction of the Euro and the phasing out of national currencies is unlikely
to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position,
liquidity or results of operations.

For additional disclosure regarding the impact to the Company from the
introduction of the Euro, see the information contained under the caption "Euro
Conversion" on page F-23 of the appendix to the Company's Proxy Statement for
its 2000 annual meeting of stockholders.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:
- ---------------------------------

In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", subsequently amended by SFAS No.
137 and SFAS No. 138 (as amended, hereafter referred to as SFAS 133), which the
Company is required to adopt in the first quarter of 2001. SFAS 133 will require
the Company to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The
impact of SFAS 133 on the Company's consolidated financial position, liquidity,
and results of operations will depend upon a variety of factors, including
future interpretive guidance from the FASB and the extent of the Company's
hedging activities. The Company is continuing to take the necessary steps to
implement SFAS 133. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 133 to
materially affect its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of
operations.

In December 1999, the Securities & Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting
Bulletin Number 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB 101).
The guidelines in SAB 101 must be adopted during the fourth quarter of 2000. The
Company does not expect the adoption of these guidelines will have a material
impact on its consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of
operations.

In March 2000, the FASB issued its Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation - an interpretation of APB
Opinion No. 25" (FIN 44). FIN 44 applies prospectively to new awards, exchanges
of awards in a business combination, modifications to outstanding awards, and
changes in grantee status that occur on or after July 1, 2000, except for the
provisions related to repricings and the definition of an

                                      42
<PAGE>

employee which apply to awards issued after December 15,1998. The Company does
not expect the implementation of these guidelines will have a material impact on
its consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations.

Business Risks:

Statements that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements based on
current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, statements about research and
development expenditures, depreciation expense, interest expense, tax rates,
future special charges by the Company, the future of the Company's relationship
with Teledesic LLC, the completion of pending transactions, capital
expenditures, the need to provide or arrange financing for customers, the
Company's ability to access the capital markets on acceptable terms and
conditions, the outcome of Iridium's bankruptcy proceedings, future actions
relating to the Iridium project, the impact of lawsuits and other claims in
connection with the Iridium project on the Company, the impact of the Euro
conversion, future hedging activity by the Company, the ability of
counterparties to financial instruments to perform their obligations and the
impact of recent accounting pronouncements on the Company. The Company wishes to
caution the reader that the factors below and those on pages F-25 through F-28
of the appendix to Company's Proxy Statement for its 2000 annual meeting of
stockholders and in its other SEC filings could cause the Company's results to
differ materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements. These
factors include: (i) the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the company,
including the impact of the weakening Euro; (ii) the impact that lower than
anticipated demand worldwide for cellular telephones will have on the Company's
performance; (iii) the demand for the Company's products, including products
related to new technologies such a Internet-ready phones; (iv) the Company's
ability to achieve continued improvement in the profitability of its digital
wireless telephone business, especially as it competes in the lower-tier
wireless telephone market; (v) the Company's success in the emerging 3G market;
(vi) the demand for vendor financing and the Company's ability to provide that
financing in order to remain competitive; (vii) continued improvement in the
worldwide semiconductor industry and the Company's participation in that
improvement; (viii) difficulties, delays or unexpected liabilities or expenses
encountered in connection with the implementation of Iridium's liquidation
proceedings or unfavorable outcomes to any currently pending or future
litigation involving the Iridium project; (ix) pricing pressures and demand for
the Company's products, especially if economic conditions worsen in the
Company's markets; (x) the success of alliances and agreements with other
companies to develop new products and services; (xi) unexpected revisions or
cancellations to orders for products; (xii) product and technology development
and commercialization risks, including for newer digital products; (xiii)
difficulties in integrating the operations of newly-acquired businesses and
achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits; and (xiv)
unexpected changes in the requirements for manufacturing capacity, which may
necessitate different levels of capital expenditures.

                                        for the Period Ending September 30, 2000

                                MOTOROLA OMNIBUS
                             INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2000

                       (as amended through June 2, 2000)


     1.  Purpose.  The purposes of the Motorola Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2000
(the "Plan") are (i) to encourage outstanding individuals to accept or continue
employment with Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") and its subsidiaries or to serve as
directors of Motorola, and (ii) to furnish maximum incentive to those persons to
improve operations and increase profits and to strengthen the mutuality of
interest between those persons and Motorola's stockholders by providing them
stock options and other stock and cash incentives.

     2.  Administration.  The Plan will be administered by a Committee (the
"Committee") of the Motorola Board of Directors consisting of two or more
directors as the Board may designate from time to time, each of whom shall
qualify as a "Non-Employee Director" within the meaning set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act") or any successor legislation.  The Committee shall have the authority to
construe and interpret the Plan and any benefits granted thereunder, to
establish and amend rules for Plan administration, to change the terms and
conditions of options and other benefits at or after grant, and to make all
other determinations which it deems necessary or advisable for the
administration of the Plan.  The determinations of the Committee shall be made
in accordance with their judgment as to the best interests of Motorola and its
stockholders and in accordance with the purposes of the Plan.  A majority of the
members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and all determinations of
the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members.  Any determination of
the Committee under the Plan may be made without notice or meeting of the
Committee, in writing signed by all the Committee members.  The Committee may
delegate the administration of the Plan, in whole or in part, on such terms and
conditions as it may impose, to such other person or persons as it may determine
in its discretion, except with respect to benefits to officers subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act or officers who are or may be "covered employees"
within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Covered
Employees").

     3.  Participants.  Participants may consist of all employees of Motorola
and its subsidiaries and all Non-Employee Directors of Motorola.  Any
corporation or other entity in which a 50% or greater interest is at the time
directly or indirectly owned by Motorola shall be a subsidiary for purposes of
the Plan.  Designation of a participant in any year shall not require the
Committee to designate that person to receive a benefit in any other year or to
receive the same type or amount of benefit as granted to the participant in any
other year or as granted to any other participant in any year.  The Committee
shall consider all factors that it deems relevant in selecting participants and
in determining the type and amount of their respective benefits.

     4.  Shares Available under the Plan.  There is hereby reserved for issuance
under the Plan an aggregate of 107,100,000 shares (reflecting adjustment for the
3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000) of Motorola common stock.  If there
is a lapse, expiration, termination or cancellation of any stock option issued
under the Plan prior to the issuance of shares thereunder or if shares of common
stock are issued under the Plan and thereafter are reacquired by Motorola, the
shares subject to those options and the reacquired shares shall be added to the
shares available for benefits under the Plan.  In addition, any shares of common
stock exchanged
<PAGE>

by an optionee as full or partial payment to Motorola of the exercise price
under any stock option exercised under the Plan, any shares retained by Motorola
pursuant to a participant's tax withholding election, and any shares covered by
a benefit which is settled in cash shall be added to the shares available for
benefits under the Plan.  All shares issued under the Plan may be either
authorized and unissued shares or issued shares reacquired by Motorola.  Under
the Plan, no participant may receive in any calendar year (i) Stock Options
relating to more than 3,000,000 shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1
stock split effective June 1, 2000), (ii) Restricted Stock that is subject to
the attainment of Performance Goals of Section 13 hereof relating to more than
300,000 shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective
June 1, 2000), (iii) Stock Appreciation Rights relating to more than 3,000,000
shares (reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective June 1,
2000), or (iv) Performance Shares relating to more than 300,000 shares
(reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000).  The
shares reserved for issuance and the limitations set forth above shall be
subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 15 hereof.  All of the
available shares may, but need not, be issued pursuant to the exercise of
incentive stock options.  Notwithstanding anything else contained in this
Section 4 the number of shares that may be issued under the Plan for benefits
other than stock options shall not exceed a total of 9,000,000 shares
(reflecting adjustment for the 3-for-1 stock split effective June 1, 2000,
subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 15 hereof).

     5.  Types of Benefits.  Benefits under the Plan shall consist of Stock
Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Performance Stock,
Performance Units, Annual Management Incentive Awards and Other Stock or Cash
Awards, all as described below.

     6.  Stock Options.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Stock Options may be
granted to participants, at any time as determined by the Committee.  The
Committee shall determine the number of shares subject to each option and
whether the option is an Incentive Stock Option.  The option price for each
option shall be determined by the Committee but shall not be less than 100% of
the fair market value of Motorola's common stock on the date the option is
granted.  Each option shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine
at the time of grant.  Options shall be exercisable at such time and subject to
such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine; provided, however,
that no option shall be exercisable later than the tenth anniversary of its
grant.  The option price, upon exercise of any option, shall be payable to
Motorola in full by (a) cash payment or its equivalent, (b) tendering previously
acquired shares (held for at least six months) having a fair market value at the
time of exercise equal to the option price, (c) certification of ownership of
such previously-acquired shares, (d) delivery of a properly executed exercise
notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver
to Motorola the amount of sale proceeds from the option shares or loan proceeds
to pay the exercise price and any withholding taxes due to Motorola, and (e)
such other methods of payment as the Committee, at its discretion, deems
appropriate.  In no event shall the Committee cancel any outstanding Stock
Option for the purpose of reissuing the option to the participant at a lower
exercise price or reduce the option price of an outstanding option.

     7.  Stock Appreciation Rights.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Stock
Appreciation Rights ("SARs") may be granted to participants at any time as
determined by the Committee.  An SAR may be granted in tandem with a Stock
Option granted under this Plan or on a free-standing basis.  The grant price of
a tandem SAR shall be equal to the option price of the related option.  The
grant price of a free-standing SAR shall be equal to the fair market value of

                                       2
<PAGE>

Motorola's common stock on the date of its grant.  An SAR may be exercised upon
such terms and conditions and for the term as the Committee in its sole
discretion determines; provided, however, that the term shall not exceed the
option term in the case of a tandem SAR or ten years in the case of a free
standing SAR.  Upon exercise of an SAR, the participant shall be entitled to
receive payment from Motorola in cash or stock, at the discretion of the
Committee, in an amount determined by multiplying the excess of the fair market
value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over the grant price of
the SAR by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.

     8.  Restricted Stock.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Restricted Stock
may be awarded or sold to participants under such terms and conditions as shall
be established by the Committee.  Restricted Stock shall be subject to such
restrictions as the Committee determines, including, without limitation, any of
the following:

          (a)  a prohibition against sale, assignment, transfer, pledge,
          hypothecation or other encumbrance of the shares of Restricted Stock
          for a specified period; or

          (b)  a requirement that the holder of Restricted Stock forfeit (or in
          the case of shares sold to the participant resell to Motorola at cost)
          such shares in the event of termination of employment during the
          period of restriction.

All restrictions shall expire at such times as the Committee shall specify.

     9.  Performance Stock.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee
shall designate the participants to whom long-term performance stock
("Performance Stock") is to be awarded and determine the number of shares, the
length of the performance period and the other terms and conditions of each such
award.  Each award of Performance Stock shall entitle the participant to a
payment in the form of shares of common stock upon the attainment of performance
goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee.

          Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of
shares issued under a Performance Stock award may be adjusted by the Committee
on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee in its sole
discretion shall determine.  However, the Committee may not, in any event,
increase the number of shares earned upon satisfaction of any performance goal
by any participant who is a Covered Employee.  The Committee may, in its
discretion, make a cash payment equal to the fair market value of shares of
common stock otherwise required to be issued to a participant pursuant to a
Performance Stock award.

     10.  Performance Units.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee
shall designate the participants to whom long-term performance units
("Performance Units") are to be awarded and determine the number of units and
the terms and conditions of each such award.  Each Performance Unit award shall
entitle the participant to a payment in cash upon the attainment of performance
goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee.

          Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the amount
to be paid under a Performance Unit award may be adjusted by the Committee on
the basis of such further consideration as the Committee in its sole discretion
shall determine.  However, the Committee may not, in any event, increase the
amount earned under Performance Unit awards upon satisfaction of any performance
goal by any participant who is a Covered Employee and the maximum amount earned
by a Covered Employee in any calendar year may not exceed $5,000,000.  The
Committee may, in its discretion, substitute actual shares of common stock for

                                       3
<PAGE>

the cash payment otherwise required to be made to a participant pursuant to a
Performance Unit award.

     11.  Annual Management Incentive Awards.  The Committee may designate
Motorola executive officers who are eligible to receive a monetary payment in
any calendar year based on a percentage of an incentive pool equal to 5% of
Motorola's consolidated operating earnings for the calendar year.  The Committee
shall allocate an incentive pool percentage to each designated participant for
each calendar year.  In no event may the incentive pool percentage for any one
participant exceed 30% of the total pool.  Consolidated operating earnings shall
mean the consolidated earnings before income taxes of the Company, computed in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but shall exclude the
effects of Extraordinary Items.  Extraordinary Items shall mean (i)
extraordinary, unusual and/or non-recurring items of gain or loss, (ii) gains or
losses on the disposition of a business, (iii) changes in tax or accounting
regulations or laws, or (iv) the effect of a merger or acquisition, all of which
must be identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or
the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's annual report.

          As soon as possible after the determination of the incentive pool for
a Plan year, the Committee shall calculate the participant's allocated portion
of the incentive pool based upon the percentage established at the beginning of
the calendar year.  The participant's incentive award then shall be determined
by the Committee based on the participant's allocated portion of the incentive
pool subject to adjustment in the sole discretion of the Committee.  In no event
may the portion of the incentive pool allocated to a participant who is a
Covered Employee be increased in any way, including as a result of the reduction
of any other participant's allocated portion.

     12.  Other Stock or Cash Awards.  In addition to the incentives described
in sections 6 through 11 above, and subject to the terms of the Plan, the
Committee may grant other incentives payable in cash or in common stock under
the Plan as it determines to be in the best interests of Motorola and subject to
such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.

     13.  Performance Goals.  Awards of Restricted Stock, Performance Stock,
Performance Units and other incentives under the Plan may be made subject to the
attainment of performance goals relating to one or more business criteria within
the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, including, but not
limited to, cash flow; cost; ratio of debt to debt plus equity; profit before
tax; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization; earnings per share; operating earnings; economic
value added; ratio of operating earnings to capital spending; free cash flow;
net profit; net sales; price of Company Stock; return on net assets, equity or
stockholders' equity; market share; or total return to shareholders
("Performance Criteria").  Any Performance Criteria may be used to measure the
performance of the Company as a whole or any business unit of the Company.  Any
Performance Criteria may include or exclude Extraordinary Items.  Performance
Criteria shall be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial
statements, generally accepted accounting principles, or under a methodology
established by the Committee prior to the issuance of an award which is
consistently applied and identified in the audited financial statements,
including footnotes, or the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the
Company's annual report.  However, the Committee may not in any event increase
the amount of compensation payable to a Covered Employee upon the attainment of
a performance goal.

                                       4
<PAGE>

     14.  Change in Control.  Except as otherwise determined by the Committee at
the time of grant of an award, upon a Change in Control of Motorola, all
outstanding Stock Options and SARs shall become vested and exercisable; all
restrictions on Restricted Stock shall lapse; all performance goals shall be
deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms and conditions met; all
Performance Stock shall be delivered; all Performance Units shall be paid out as
promptly as practicable; all Annual Management Incentive Awards shall be paid
out based on the consolidated operating earnings of the immediately preceding
year or such other method of payment as may be determined by the Committee at
the time of award or thereafter but prior to the Change in Control; and all
Other Stock or Cash Awards shall be delivered or paid.  A "Change in Control"
shall mean:

               A Change in Control of a nature that would be required to be
          reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A
          promulgated under the Exchange Act whether or not Motorola is then
          subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, without
          limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred
          if (a) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Section
          13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial
          owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
          indirectly, of securities of Motorola representing 20% or more of the
          combined voting power of Motorola's then outstanding securities (other
          than Motorola or any employee benefit plan of Motorola; and, for
          purposes of the Plan, no Change in Control shall be deemed to have
          occurred as a result of the "beneficial ownership," or changes
          therein, of Motorola's securities by either of the foregoing), (b)
          there shall be consummated (i) any consolidation or merger of Motorola
          in which Motorola is not the surviving or continuing corporation or
          pursuant to which shares of common stock would be converted into or
          exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than a merger
          of Motorola in which the holders of common stock immediately prior to
          the merger have, directly or indirectly, at least a 65% ownership
          interest in the outstanding common stock of the surviving corporation
          immediately after the merger, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange or
          other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related
          transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of Motorola
          other than any such transaction with entities in which the holders of
          Motorola Common Stock, directly or indirectly, have at least a 65%
          ownership interest, (c) the stockholders of Motorola approve any plan
          or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Motorola, or (d) as
          the result of, or in connection with, any cash tender offer, exchange
          offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets, proxy or
          consent solicitation (other than by the Board), contested election or
          substantial stock accumulation (a "Control Transaction"), the members
          of the Board immediately prior to the first public announcement
          relating to such Control Transaction shall thereafter cease to
          constitute a majority of the Board.

     15.  Adjustment Provisions.

          (a)  If Motorola shall at any time change the number of issued shares
          of common stock by stock dividend or stock split, the total number of
          shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, the maximum number of
          shares which may be made subject to an award in any calendar year, and
          the number of shares

                                       5
<PAGE>

          covered by each outstanding award and the price therefor, if any,
          shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee, in its sole discretion.

          (b)  Subject to the provisions of Section 14, without affecting the
          number of shares reserved or available hereunder the Board of
          Directors or the Committee may authorize the issuance or assumption of
          benefits under this Plan in connection with any merger, consolidation,
          acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization upon such terms
          and conditions as it may deem appropriate.

          (c)  In the event of any merger, consolidation or reorganization of
          Motorola with or into another corporation, other than a merger,
          consolidation or reorganization in which Motorola is the continuing
          corporation and which does not result in the outstanding common stock
          being converted into or exchanged for different securities, cash or
          other property, or any combination thereof, there shall be
          substituted, on an equitable basis as determined by the Committee in
          its discretion, for each share of common stock then subject to a
          benefit granted under the Plan, the number and kind of shares of
          stock, other securities, cash or other property to which holders of
          common stock of Motorola will be entitled pursuant to the transaction.

     16.  Nontransferability.  Each benefit granted under the Plan shall not be
transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and
each Stock Option and SAR shall be exercisable during the participant's lifetime
only by the participant or, in the event of disability, by the participant's
personal representative.  In the event of the death of a participant, exercise
of any benefit or payment with respect to any benefit shall be made only by or
to the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased participant or
the person or persons to whom the deceased participant's rights under the
benefit shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at its discretion, the Committee may permit the
transfer of a Stock Option by the participant, subject to such terms and
conditions as may be established by the Committee.

     17.  Taxes.  Motorola shall be entitled to withhold the amount of any tax
attributable to any amounts payable or shares deliverable under the Plan, after
giving the person entitled to receive such payment or delivery notice and
Motorola may defer making payment or delivery as to any award, if any such tax
is payable until indemnified to its satisfaction.  The Committee may, in its
discretion, subject to such rules as it may adopt, permit a participant to pay
all or a portion of any required withholding taxes arising in connection with
the exercise of a Stock Option or SAR or the receipt or vesting of shares
hereunder by electing to have Motorola withhold shares of common stock, having a
fair market value equal to the amount to be withheld.

     18.  Duration, Amendment and Termination.  No Incentive Stock Option shall
be granted more than ten years after the date of adoption of this Plan by the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that the terms and conditions applicable
to any benefit granted on or before such date may thereafter be amended or
modified by mutual agreement between Motorola and the participant, or such other
person as may then have an interest therein.  The Board of Directors or the
Committee may amend the Plan from time to time or terminate the Plan at any
time.  However, no such action shall reduce the amount of any existing award or
change the terms and conditions thereof without the participant's consent.  No
amendment of the Plan shall

                                       6
<PAGE>

be made without stockholder approval if stockholder approval is required by law,
regulation, or stock exchange rule.

     19.  Fair Market Value.  The fair market value of Motorola's common stock
at any time shall be determined in such manner as the Committee may deem
equitable, or as required by applicable law or regulation.

     20.  Other Provisions.

          (a)  The award of any benefit under the Plan may also be subject to
other provisions (whether or not applicable to the benefit awarded to any other
participant) as the Committee determines appropriate, including provisions
intended to comply with federal or state securities laws and stock exchange
requirements, understandings or conditions as to the participant's employment,
requirements or inducements for continued ownership of common stock after
exercise or vesting of benefits, forfeiture of awards in the event of
termination of employment shortly after exercise or vesting, or breach of
noncompetition or confidentiality agreements following termination of
employment, or provisions permitting the deferral of the receipt of a benefit
for such period and upon such terms as the Committee shall determine.

          (b)  In the event any benefit under this Plan is granted to an
employee who is employed or providing services outside the United States and who
is not compensated from a payroll maintained in the United States, the Committee
may, in its sole discretion, modify the provisions of the Plan as they pertain
to such individuals to comply with applicable law, regulation or accounting
rules.

     21.  Governing Law.  The Plan and any actions taken in connection herewith
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of
Delaware (without regard to applicable Delaware principles of conflict of laws).

     22.  Stockholder Approval.  The Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors
on February 29, 2000, subject to stockholder approval.  The Plan and any
benefits granted thereunder shall be null and void if stockholder approval is
not obtained at the next annual meeting of stockholders.

OVERVIEW
- --------
Here is an overview of the 2000 LRIP:
 .  Performance Cycle

   The 2000 LRIP is based upon rolling three-year performance cycles as
   illustrated below:

                                                                      ------------------------------------------
</TABLE>

 .  Performance Measure
   Performance will be measured and based on relative total shareholder return
   (TSR). Relative TSR will be determined as follows:

   STEP #1: TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR)
   ---------------------------------------
   .  Total shareholder return (TSR) is the annualized measure of the change in
      shareholder value over the performance cycle.

   .  TSR will be calculated as follows:
                        TSR = Dividends + Change in Stock Price
                        ---------------------------------------
                                 Beginning Stock Price

   .  The annualized TSR will be based on the quarterly reinvestment of
      dividends.

   .  The actual beginning and/or closing stock price on any day that either
      starts or ends a measurement period will be the stock price used in all
      2000 LRIP calculations.
<PAGE>

  STEP #2: PERCENTILE RANKING
  ---------------------------
  . Our annualized TSR will than be compared to the TSR of each member of a peer
    group to determine our ranking within that group. The Compensation Committee
    of the Board has the authority to modify this peer group for future cycles.
    (Click here for the peer group used in the 2000 LRIP.)
    (NOTE: PUT A LINK TO THAT PAGE OF THIS DOCUMENT HERE.)

  . Our percentile ranking will be determined as follows:
    Percentile Rank = 1 -                     Company Rank
                          ---------------------------------------------------
                          No. of Companies in Peer Group (Including Motorola)

  STEP #3: RELATIVE TSR
  ---------------------
  . The percentile ranking of Motorola's annualized TSR within that group is the
    relative TSR.

  . The relative TSR will determine the extent to which any performance award is
    earned.

 .   Why Relative TSR as the Performance Measure TSR is the final measure of
    shareholder value-creation and is the only means by which shareholders gain
    a return on their investment. Relative TSR is used because, beyond an
    absolute improvement in shareholder wealth, investors require an investment
    to deliver returns consistent with the competition.

    The only way Motorola can be the company-of-choice to investors, to current
    and prospective employees, and to our customers, is to create and sustain
    superior TSR relative to our competition.

    Over time, if we are not above the median TSR (above the 50th percentile
    ranking of our competition), our ability to create shareholder and customer
    value may be significantly diminished.

    As senior executives of Motorola, you have considerable influence over value
    creation. Thus, the 2000 LRIP is an important component of our overall long-
    term incentive structure and pay-for-performance philosophy.

 .   Earned Award Determination
    . If the annualized TSR is less than six percent (6.0%), no award will be
      paid.

    . If the annualized TSR is greater than or equal to six percent (6.0%) and
      our relative position is at least the 50th percentile of our peer group,
      each participant will have an opportunity to earn a performance award.

 .   Calculation of Earned Award
    . A participant's earned award will be determined utilizing the following
      factors:

      . A participant's base salary as of the end of the performance cycle. For
        purposes of the 2000 LRIP "base salary" means the contractual definition
        of base salary in each country.

      . The target award opportunity, which is a percentage of base salary.
        There are three levels of target award opportunity: 100%, 75%, and 50%
        of base salary. The Compensation Committee upon the recommendation of
        the CEO will make

                                       2
<PAGE>

       determination of participation levels at the beginning of each
       performance cycle. The Compensation Committee will determine the
       participant level for the CEO.

    .  The earned award expressed as a percentage of the target award.
       This factor is a function of Motorola's percentile ranking, the
       relationship of which is illustrated below:

       <TABLE>
       <CAPTION>
       ==========================================================
                                           Earned Award as

       ----------------------------------------------------------
       <S>                           <C>
       (greater or less than) 80th               200%
                              75th               175%
                              65th               150%
                              55th               125%
                              50th               100%
               (greater than) 50th                 0%
       ----------------------------------------------------------
       </TABLE>
       *The results will be interpolated if the percentile rank falls between
        the ranks above.

    .  A participant's earned award will be calculated as follows:
       (Ending Base Salary) x (Target Award) x (Earned Award as % of Target) =
       Earned Award

 .   Maximum Earned Award
    A participant's maximum earned award will be two times his/her target award.

 .   Example of Earned Award Calculation
    As an example, assume the following:
    .  A participant's base salary at the ending of a cycle is $300,000.
    .  The participant's target award opportunity is 50% of base salary.
    .  Motorola's percentile rank at the completion of the cycle is the 75th
       percentile, which means the earned award expressed as a percentage of the
       target award is 175%.

            $300,000          x     50%        x           175%            =       $262,500
       --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       </TABLE>

                                       3
<PAGE>

 .  The Payout Process
   .  All earned awards will be paid in cash. Payments will be made as soon as
      administratively practicable following the close of the performance cycle.
   .  A participant has no right to any award until that award is paid.
   .  If the Compensation Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that a
      participant has willfully engaged in any activity at any time, prior to
      the payment of an award, that the Committee determines was, is, or will be
      harmful to the Company, the participant will forfeit any unpaid award.

SITUATIONS AFFECTING 2000 LRIP
- ------------------------------
 .  Change in Employment
   .  Generally, a participant will be eligible for payment of an earned award
      only if employment continues until the award payout date.

   .  Pro rata awards may be possible, however, depending upon the type of the
      employment termination. The table below summarizes how earned awards will
      generally be prorated in accordance with the type of employment
      termination:

</TABLE>


The prorated payout will be paid as soon as administratively practicable after
the end of the performance cycle.

For purposes of the 2000 LRIP, "Disability" and "Retirement" will be defined as
set forth below:

 . Total and Permanent Disability means for (x) U.S. employees, entitlement to
  long-term disability benefits under the Motorola Disability Income Plan, as
  amended and any successor plan and (y) non-U.S. employees, as established by
  applicable Motorola policy or as required by local regulations.

                                       4
<PAGE>

 . Retirement means your retirement from Motorola or a Subsidiary as follows:

  (i) Retiring at or after age 55 with 20 years of service;

  (ii) Retiring at or after age 60 with 10 years of service;

  (iii) Retiring at or after age 65, without regard to years of service.

  Years of service will be based on your Service Club Date.

 .  Change of Control
   If Motorola undergoes a Change of Control as defined in the Omnibus Plan of
   2000:

   .  The percentile ranking for each performance cycle will be determined as of
      the effective date of the Change of Control.

   .  Pro rata award payments will be made based on the number of completed
      months of each cycle as of the effective date of the Change of Control.

   .  Awards will be paid in cash as soon as administratively practicable
      following the effective date of the Change of Control.

 .  Integration with the Motorola Long Range Incentive Plan of 1994
   If a participant earns an award for any remaining performance cycle under the
   Motorola Long Range Incentive Plan of 1994, as amended on February 4, 1998
   ("Cycle 6"--1999-2002), and an award for a performance cycle under the
   Motorola Long Range Incentive Plan of 2000 ("Cycle 7"--2000-2002), the
   participant will receive the greater of the two awards. In no event will a
   participant receive an award from both plans for overlapping performance
   cycles.

DEFINITION OF TERMS
- -------------------
"Subsidiary" means an entity of which Motorola owns directly or indirectly at
least 50% and that Motorola consolidates for financial reporting purposes.

If a term is used buy not defined, it has the meaning given such term in the
Plan.

RESERVATION AND RETAINMENT OF COMPANY RIGHTS
- --------------------------------------------
  .  The selection of any employee for participation in the 2000 LRIP will not
     give that participant any right to be retained in the employ of the
     Company.

  .  The right and power of the Company to terminate the employment of any
     participant is specifically reserved.

  .  The participant acknowledges his or her understanding that participation in
     this Plan is completely at the discretion of Motorola, and that the
     Motorola's decision to make this Award in no way implies that similar
     awards may be granted in the future. In addition, the Grantee hereby
     acknowledges that he or she has entered into employment with Motorola or a
     Motorola Subsidiary upon terms that did not include this Award or similar
     awards, that his or her decision to continue employment is not dependent on
     an expectation of this Award or similar awards, and that any amount
     received under from this Award is considered an amount in addition to that
     which the Grantee expects to be paid for the performance of his services.

                                       5

It is expressly understood that the Compensation Committee is authorized to
administer, construe, and make all determinations necessary or appropriate to
the administration of the 2000 LRIP, all of which will be binding upon the
participant.

AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION, and TERMINATION
- ----------------------------------------
The Compensation Committee may amend, modify, or terminate the 2000 LRIP
provided, however, that no such amendment, modification, or termination in any
way adversely affects a participant's rights to an outstanding award without the
participant's written consent.

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
- ------------------------
 .  The parties agree that any dispute or controversy arising under or in
   connection with the 2000 LRIP will be settled by arbitration, conducted
   before a single arbitrator sitting in a location selected by the participant
   within fifty (50) miles from the location of his or her job with Motorola, in
   accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in
   effect.

   Judgement may be entered on the award of the arbitrator in any court having
   proper jurisdiction. The Company and the participant will share the expenses
   of such arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the arbitrator
   equally. Each party will be responsible for payment of its own expenses and
   legal fees. The arbitrator may not award legal fees, costs, or any punitive
   or exemplary damages to either party.

 .  Award opportunities may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or
   otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of
   descent and distribution.

 .  The Company will have the right to require participants to remit the Company
   an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local withholding tax
   requirements, or to deduct from any or all payments under the LRIP 2000
   amounts sufficient to satisfy all withholding tax requirements.

 .  To the extent permitted by law, amounts paid under the 2000 LRIP will not be
   considered to be compensation for purposes of any benefit plan or program
   maintained by the Company.

 .  All obligations of the Company under the 2000 LRIP with respect to payout of
   awards, and the corresponding rights granted thereunder, will be binding on
   any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the
   result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or other
   acquisition of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the
   Company.

                                       6
<PAGE>

 .  In the event that any provision of the 2000 LRIP will be held illegal or
   invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity will not affect the
   remaining parts of the plan, and the 2000 LRIP will be construed and enforced
   as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included.

 .  No participant or beneficiary will have any interest whatsoever in any
   specific asset of the Company. To the extent that any person acquires a right
   to receive payments under the 2000 LRIP, such right will be no greater than
   the right of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

 .  To the extent not preempted by federal law, the 2000 LRIP, and all agreements
   hereunder, will be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of
   the state of Illinois without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of
   laws.
