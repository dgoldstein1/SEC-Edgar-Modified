  Business Segments

     Personal Communications Segment

     The Personal Communications Sector ("PCS" or the "segment") primarily
designs, manufactures, sells and services wireless subscriber equipment
including wireless telephones, iDEN(R) digital phones, and satellite radio-
telephones, paging and advanced messaging devices and personal 2-way radios,
with related software and accessory products. Products are marketed worldwide
through carriers, distributors, dealers, retailers, and, in certain markets,
through licensees.

     Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services. The allocation
of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout
the world and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services. The
growth of the wireless and personal communications industry may be affected if
adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies
are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such
use. Such occurrences might have an effect on the segment's results.

     Generally, PCS carries reasonable product inventories in distribution
centers to meet customer delivery requirements. However, during 1999, worldwide
demand and production of wireless phones were greater than manufacturers and
component suppliers had anticipated at the beginning of 1999. As a result, there
were shortages of certain types of components used in manufacturing wireless
phones, including those used by Motorola. While component shortages are expected
to continue in the first and second quarters of 2000, the availability of
components continues to improve sequentially.

     Generally, PCS does not permit customers to return merchandise and does not
grant extended payment terms, although exceptions may be made, primarily in the
retail segments of the segment's business, if necessary to meet unique market
conditions.

                                       1
<PAGE>

  During 1999, in the Americas region, PCS and the wireless telephone market
experienced a continued acceleration in the technology shift to digital phones
and products from analog products.  Asia and Europe had already substantially
completed the transition to digital.  PCS introduced a variety of new digital
wireless products during 1999, with digital representing over 80% of unit
shipments in 1999.

  The segment experiences intense competition in worldwide markets from numerous
global competitors including some of the world's largest companies.  In
particular, the segment has experienced significant competition in the market
for digital wireless products.  Competitive factors in the market for the
segment's products include: technology offered; price; product performance,
features, quality, delivery and warranty; the quality and availability of
service; company image; relationship with key customers and time-to-market.

  The segment's backlog amounted to $2.8 billion at December 31, 1999 and $1.3
billion at December 31, 1998.   The 1999 order backlog is believed to be
generally firm and 100% of that amount is expected to be shipped in 2000. The
forward-looking estimates of the firmness of such orders is subject to future
events which may cause the percentage of the 1999 backlog actually shipped to
change.

  Materials used in the segment's operations are generally second-sourced to
ensure a continuity of supply.  Occasionally, shortages or extended delivery
periods have occurred in various component parts, such as those discussed above,
the effects of which have generally been industry-wide and short in duration.
Energy necessary for the segment's manufacturing facilities consists of
electricity, natural gas and gasoline, all of which are currently in generally
adequate supply.  The segment's facilities are highly automated and, therefore,
require a reliable source of electrical power.  Labor is generally available in
reasonable proximity to the segment's manufacturing facilities.  Difficulties in
obtaining any of the aforementioned items could affect the segment's results.

  Patent protection is extremely important to the segment's operations.  The
segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its products,
technologies and manufacturing processes.  Motorola is also licensed to use
certain patents owned by others.  The protection of these licenses is also
important to the segment's operations.  Reference is made to the material under
the heading "General" for information relating to patents and trademarks,
research and development activities and the seasonality and volatility of
business with respect to this segment.

  PCS's headquarters are located in Libertyville, Illinois.  Its major
facilities are located in Libertyville and Harvard, Illinois; Boynton Beach and
Plantation, Florida; Easter Inch, Scotland; Dublin, Ireland; Flensburg, Germany;
Tianjin, China; Penang, Malaysia; Singapore; Chihuahua, Mexico, and Jaguariuna,
Brazil.  PCS also has interests in two Korean cellular handset design and
manufacturing firms, cellular joint ventures in Hangzhou and Shanghai, China,
and a manufacturing licensee in China.  PCS also uses several original equipment
manufacturing ("OEM") contractors to support its worldwide manufacturing needs.
Additional engineering, software development and administration offices are
located in San Diego, California; Piscataway, New Jersey; Ft. Worth, Texas;
Tokyo, Japan; Beijing, China, and Korea.


  Network Systems Segment

  The Network Systems Segment ("NSS" or the "segment") primarily designs,
manufactures, sells, installs and services wireless cellular and personal
communication infrastructure equipment.  Also included in this segment is the
satellite communications business, which markets, designs, builds, and operates
and maintains space-based telecommunications systems.

  NSS wireless infrastructure products include electronic exchanges (i.e.,
telephone switches), base site controllers and radio base stations for Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Personal Digital Cellular (PDC), Global System
for Mobile Communications (GSM), iDEN(R) integrated digital enhanced network,
wireless local loop, broadband fixed wireless, and analog technologies.
Products are marketed worldwide through a direct sales force, licensees or
agents.

  The satellite communication business built and is operating and maintaining
the Iridium(R) satellite communication system.  Iridium is the first low-earth
orbit, worldwide satellite-based communications network in existence for general
public use.  Since August 1999, Iridium LLC (Iridium LLC and its operating
subsidiaries are

                                       2
<PAGE>

collectively referred to as "Iridium") has been operating as debtors-in-
possession under the regulations of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. For
a more detailed discussion of Motorola's relationship with Iridium, see Note 8,
"Commitments and Contingencies: Iridium" and Note 15, "Subsequent Events," of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the appendix to Motorola's
Proxy Statement for the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders.

  Radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services.  The allocation
of frequencies is regulated in the United States and other countries throughout
the world, and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services.  The
growth of the wireless and personal communications industry may be affected if
adequate frequencies are not allocated or, alternatively, if new technologies
are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such
use.  Such occurrences might have an effect on the segment's results.

  The nature of NSS's business is larger long-term contracts with major
operators.  Therefore, the individual loss of any large customer could have a
material adverse affect on the segment's business.

  For NSS, payment terms are particular to individual contracts, some of which
provide for the holdback of certain residual amounts due to Motorola until
system acceptance by the customer.  In certain circumstances, NSS permits
customer returns in accordance with specific contract terms.  Increasingly,
network operators are requiring suppliers, like NSS, to provide or arrange for
long-term financing in connection with equipment purchases.  Financing may cover
all or a portion of the purchase price, as well as working capital and can be
sizable.  NSS may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks or
other sources.  NSS expects that the need to provide this financing or arrange
financing for its customers will continue, and may become increasingly important
in this segment.

  The segment experiences intense competition in worldwide markets from numerous
competitors ranging in size from some of the world's largest companies to small,
specialized firms. In particular, the segment has experienced significant
competition in the market for digital products.  Competitive factors in the
market for the segment's products include: technology offered; price;
availability of vendor financing; product and system performance, features,
quality, delivery, availability and warranty; the quality and availability of
service; company image; relationship with key customers and time-to-market.  In
the satellite communications business, the competitive factors are first-to-
market, available geographic coverage, price, quality and reliability.

  The segment's backlog amounted to $2.2 billion at both December 31, 1999 and
December 31, 1998.  No backlog relating to the Iridium program exists at
December 31, 1999 as a result of the Iridium bankruptcy proceedings described
above.  If backlog relating to the Iridium program were removed from backlog at
December 31, 1998, that number would decrease from $2.2 billion to $1.5 billion.
The 1999 order backlog is believed to be generally firm and 100% of that amount
is expected to be shipped in 2000.  The forward-looking estimates of the
firmness of such orders is subject to future events which may cause the
percentage of the 1999 backlog actually shipped to change.

  Materials used in the segment's operations are generally second-sourced to
ensure a continuity of supply. Occasional shortages in purchased components do
occur.  Energy necessary for the segment's manufacturing facilities consists of
electricity, natural gas and gasoline, all of which are currently in generally
adequate supply.  The segment's facilities are highly automated and, therefore,
require a reliable source of electrical power.  Labor is generally available in
reasonable proximity to the segment's manufacturing facilities.  Difficulties in
obtaining any of the aforementioned items could affect the segment's results.

  Patent protection is extremely important to the segment's operations.  The
segment has an extensive portfolio of patents relating to its products, systems,
technologies and manufacturing processes.  Motorola is also licensed to use
certain patents owned by others.  The protection of these licenses is also
important to the segment's operations.  Reference is made to the material under
the heading "General" for information relating to patents and trademarks,
research and development activities and the seasonality and volatility of
business with respect to this segment.

  NSS's headquarters are located in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Major design
centers include Arlington Heights and Schaumburg, Illinois; Chandler, Arizona;
Fort Worth, Texas; Cork, Ireland; Vancouver, British Columbia, and Swindon,
England.  NSS operates manufacturing facilities in Schaumburg, Illinois; Fort
Worth, Texas; Plantation, Florida; Jaguariuna, Brazil; Hangzhou and Tianjin,
China, and Swindon, England.

  Commercial, Government and Industrial Systems Segment

  The Commercial, Government and Industrial Solutions Sector ("CGISS" or the
"segment") provides integrated information and communications solutions for
commercial, government and industrial customers worldwide.  Its Radio Solutions
business primarily designs, manufactures, sells, installs and services analog
and digital two-way radio voice and data communications products and systems to
a wide range of public safety, government, utility, transportation and other
worldwide markets.  The Systems Solutions business develops advanced integration
technologies and markets and delivers comprehensive solutions to government,
defense, space and large-enterprise customers through the application of
converged information and communications technologies.  The business also
provides platforms for smart card products using radio frequency identification
(RFID).  CGISS also provides network services for two-way radio subscribers in
international markets through joint ventures.

  The principal customers for two-way radio products and systems include public
safety agencies, such as police, fire, highway maintenance departments and
forestry services; petroleum companies; gas, electric and water utilities;
telephone companies; diverse industrial companies; mining companies;
transportation companies such as railroads, airlines, taxicab operations and
trucking firms; institutions, such as schools and hospitals; and companies in
the construction, vending machine and service businesses.  These products are
also sold and leased to various federal agencies for many uses.  The principal
customers for systems solutions include various departments within the U.S. and
other governments, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, municipal
agencies and large commercial enterprises.  There are a few customers that,
collectively, the loss of, or a significant reduction in purchases by, could
have a material adverse effect on CGISS's results.

  Users of two-way radios are regulated by a variety of governmental and other
regulatory agencies throughout the world.  In the United States, users of two-
way radios are licensed by the Federal Communication Commission ("FCC"), which
has broad authority to make rules and regulations and prescribe restrictions and
conditions to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934.  The
FCC's authority includes, among other things, the power to classify radio
stations, prescribe the nature of the service to be rendered by each class of
station, assign frequencies to the various classes of stations and regulate the
kinds of equipment which may be used.  Regulatory agencies in other countries
have similar types of authority.  Consequently, the business and results of this
segment could be affected by the rules and regulations adopted by the FCC or
regulatory agencies in other countries from time to time.  Motorola has
developed products using trunking and data communications technologies to
enhance spectral efficiencies.  The growth and results of the two-way radio
communications industry may be affected, however, by the regulations of the FCC
or other regulatory agencies relating to the allocation of frequencies for land
mobile communications users, especially in urban areas where such frequencies
are heavily used.

  The products manufactured and marketed by CGISS are sold directly through its
own distribution force or through independent authorized distributors and
dealers, commercial mobile radio service operators and independent commission
sales representatives.  The direct distribution force also provides system
engineering and installation and other technical and systems management services
to meet the customer's particular needs.  The customer may choose to install and
maintain the equipment with its own employees, or may obtain installation,
service and parts from a network of Motorola authorized service stations (most
of whom are also authorized dealers) or from other non-Motorola service
stations. Subscriber units are sold directly and through indirect distribution
channels.

  Leasing and conditional sale arrangements are also made available to
customers.  The majority of the leases and conditional sale contracts entered
into by CGISS are sold to several unaffiliated finance companies or banks on
terms, which, in most instances, provide recourse to Motorola with certain
limitations.  In addition, a significant number of leases and conditional sale
contracts are sold to a Motorola finance subsidiary.  In certain circumstances,
CGISS permits customers to return products in accordance with industry
practices.  CGISS's business includes providing custom products based on
assembling basic units into a large variety of models or combinations.  This
requires the stocking of inventories and large varieties of piece parts and
replacement parts, as well as a variety of basic level assemblies in order to
meet short delivery requirements.

  This segment experiences widespread, intense competition from numerous
competitors ranging from some of the world's largest, diversified companies to
foreign state-owned telecommunications companies to many small, specialized
firms.  In addition, CGISS faces competition from numerous companies whose
principal manufacturing

                                       4
<PAGE>

operations are located outside the United States, which may serve to reduce
their manufacturing costs and enhance their brand recognition in their locale.
Competitive factors for CGISS include: price; technology offered; product
performance, quality, delivery and availability; and the quality and
availability of service and systems engineering, with no one factor being
dominant. An additional factor is the availability of vendor financing, as
infrastructure customers continue to look to equipment vendors as an additional
source of financing.

  This segment's backlog amounted to $2.0 billion at December 31, 1999 and $1.4
billion at December 31, 1998.  The 1999 backlog amount is believed to be
generally firm, and approximately 76% of that amount is expected to be shipped
during 2000.  This forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is
subject to future events, which may cause the percentage of the 1999 backlog
actually shipped to change.

  Availability of the materials and components required by CGISS is relatively
dependable and certain, but normal fluctuations in market demand and supply
could cause temporary, selective shortages and affect results.  Direct sourcing
of materials and components from foreign suppliers is becoming more extensive.
CGISS operates certain offshore subassembly plants, the loss of one or more of
which could constrain its production capabilities and affect results.  Natural
gas, electricity and, to a lesser extent, oil are the primary sources of energy.
Current supplies of these forms of energy are generally considered to be
adequate for this segment's U.S. and foreign operations.  However, difficulties
in obtaining any of the aforementioned items could affect the segment's results.

  Patent protection is very important to the segment's business.  Reference is
made to the material under the heading "General" for information relating to
patents and trademarks, research and development activities and volatility with
respect to this segment.

  This segment's headquarters are located in Schaumburg, Illinois, with major
manufacturing/assembly facilities in Schaumburg, Illinois; Plantation, Florida;
Mount Pleasant, Iowa; Scottsdale, Arizona; Arad, Israel; Penang, Malaysia;
Berlin, Germany, and Tianjin, China.

  Semiconductor Products Segment

  The Semiconductor Products Sector ("SPS" or the "segment") designs, produces
and sells integrated semiconductor and software solutions for customers serving
the networking and computing, transportation and wireless communication markets
and for consumer applications in imaging and entertainment.

  Semiconductors control and amplify electrical signals and are used in a broad
range of electronic products, including consumer electronic products, computers,
communications equipment, solid-state ignition systems and other automotive
electronic products, major home appliances, industrial controls, robotics,
aircraft, space vehicles, calculators and automatic controls.

  SPS sells its products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs")
and a network of industrial distributors through its own sales force, agents and
distributors.  Products manufactured by SPS are also supplied to other operating
units of Motorola.  Other businesses of Motorola collectively constitute the
segment's largest customer and the volume of purchases by these businesses has
affected, and could continue to affect, SPS's results.

  Customers are allowed to return merchandise for the longer of (i) the product
warranty period of the distributor or (ii) three years.  The segment and its
results are affected by the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.
Available capacity, cyclical customer demands, new product introductions and
aggressive pricing has and could continue to impact its business and results.

  The segment's capacity for certain products is being increased to meet current
market demand.  In addition, the segment supplements its internal manufacturing
capacity with joint venture manufacturing facilities and purchases of products
from outside vendors. SPS has announced a goal to increase the use of foundry
manufacturing for older and specialized technologies.  By year-end 1999, SPS had
outsourced 25% of its sales for 1999.

  The semiconductor industry is subject to rapid changes in technology, and
requires a high level of capital spending and an extensive research, development
and design program to maintain state-of-the-art technology. Accordingly, SPS
maintains an extensive research and development program in advanced
semiconductor technology

                                       5
<PAGE>

and a significant portion of Motorola's capital expenditures have historically
been, and are expected to continue to be, for semiconductor facilities.

  SPS experiences intense competition from numerous competitors ranging from
large companies offering a full range of products to small companies
specializing in certain segments of the market.  The competitive environment
also is changing as a result of increased alliances between competitors.  The
segment competes in many semiconductor markets, including the
telecommunications, personal computer/work station, industrial, transportation,
consumer, computer, and distributor markets.  Important factors in competition
include: price; technology offered; product features, quality, availability and
warranty; the quality and availability of service; time-to-market and company
image.  The ability to develop new products to meet customer requirements and to
meet customer delivery schedules are also competitive factors.

  The segment's backlog amounted to $1.7 billion at both December 31, 1999 and
December 31, 1998.  Backlog as of December 31, 1999 excluded the Semiconductor
Components Group business, which was sold in the third quarter of 1999.  Orders
may be and are placed by customers for delivery up to 12 months in the future
but for purposes of calculating backlog only the next 13 weeks requirements are
reported.  In the semiconductor industry, backlog quantities and shipment
schedules under outstanding purchase orders are frequently revised to reflect
changes in customer needs.  Binding agreements calling for the sale of specific
quantities at specific prices are, typically, contractually subject to price or
quantity revisions and are, as a matter of industry practice, rarely formally
enforced.  Therefore, the segment believes that most of its order backlog is
cancelable.  For these reasons, the amount of backlog as of any particular date
may not be an accurate indicator of future results.

  The segment is not currently experiencing any shortages in obtaining raw
materials.  A significant portion of certain materials and parts used by SPS is
supplied from a single country.  With respect to these and other materials, the
segment is constantly evaluating additional sources of supply to minimize the
risk of obtaining materials from only a few sources.  Electricity, oil and
natural gas are used extensively in the segment's operations.  All of these
energy sources are available in adequate quantities for current needs.
Electricity and oil are the primary energy sources for the segment's foreign
operations, and presently, there are no shortages of these sources although the
reliability of electrical power has been a problem from time to time at certain
facilities outside of the U.S.  Difficulties in obtaining any of the
aforementioned items could affect SPS's results.

  Patent protection is very important to SPS's operations. In addition, Motorola
is licensed to use certain patents owned by others.  The protection of these
licenses is also important to SPS's operations.  Reference is made to the
material under the heading "General" for information relating to patents and
trademarks, research and development activities and seasonality of business with
respect to this industry segment.

  The Semiconductor Products segment's headquarters are in Austin, Texas.  Its
major facilities are located in Austin, Texas; Chandler, Mesa and Tempe,
Arizona; Tianjin, China; Toulouse, France; Munich, Germany; Kwai Chung and Tai
Po, Hong Kong; Sendai and Tokyo, Japan; Tel Aviv, Israel; Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia; Singapore, and East Kilbride and South Queensferry, Scotland.  In
connection with the sale of its Semiconductor Component Group, the segment sold
manufacturing facilities located in Phoenix, Arizona; Aizu, Japan; Seremban,
Malaysia; Guadalajara, Mexico, and Carmona, the Philippines.  The segment also
sold major facilities in Chung-Li, Taiwan and Paju, South Korea during 1999.
SPS is consolidating its production network into fewer integrated "anchor" sites
for economies of scale and improved efficiency.

  Other Products Segment

     Integrated Electronic Systems Sector

  The Integrated Electronic Systems Sector ("IESS" or the "sector") designs,
manufactures and sells automotive and industrial electronics systems and
solutions, portable energy storage products and systems, multi-function embedded
board and computer system products, and telematics products and solutions.

  The Automotive and Industrial Electronics Group ("AIEG") uses its high-quality
application and engineering expertise to design and sell custom electronic
solutions for original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") including foreign and
domestic automobile manufacturers, heavy vehicle manufacturers, farm equipment
manufacturers and industrial customers.

                                       6
<PAGE>

  The Energy Systems Group ("ESG") delivers complete portable energy system
solutions for many of today's leading brand-name mobile phones, notebooks, palm
computers, and other portable electronic products.  A significant portion of ESG
sales is to other industry segments within Motorola, primarily the cellular
telephone business.

  The Motorola Computer Group ("MCG") specializes in embedded computing
technology that is integrated by OEMs into a wide variety of products including
the following applications: products and solutions utilized in
telecommunications infrastructures; CAT scanners and MRI medical systems; flight
simulators; and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

  The Telematics Communications Group ("TCG") provides automotive customers with
integrated cellular phones as well as a variety of wireless Internet systems
including navigation and driver safety, and hands-free Internet access.

  A significant part of the sector's business is dependent upon the business of
the other Motorola industry segments, collectively, and two external customers.
Each of these key customers is served by more than one group within the sector,
and with multiple product offerings within the groups.  The loss of a
significant portion of these customers' business could have a material adverse
effect upon the sector.  The sale of Motorola's Ceramic and Quartz Component
Division was completed in the first quarter of 1999 and definitive agreements
were signed in the fourth quarter to sell the Motorola Lighting Inc. division.
That sale closed in the first quarter of 2000.

  Demand for the products of AIEG and TCG is linked to automobile sales in the
United States and other countries.  Demand for ESG products is substantially
linked to the sales of other industry segments within Motorola.  Demand for MCG
products is linked to manufacturing systems, imaging, and telecommunications in
the United States and other countries.  The sector experiences competition from
numerous global competitors, including the automobile manufacturers' internal or
affiliated electronic control suppliers.  Competitive factors in the sale of
IESS products include:  price; product quality, performance and delivery; supply
integrity; quality reputation; responsiveness; and design and manufacturing
technology.  An additional factor for MCG products is the availability of
software.  In certain circumstances, IESS permits customers to return products
in accordance with industry practices.

  The sector's backlog amounted to $356 million at December 31, 1999 and $315
million at December 31, 1998.  The 1999 backlog for the sector is believed to be
generally firm, and approximately 100% of that amount is expected to be shipped
during 2000.  This forward looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is
subject to future events that may cause the percentage of the 1999 backlog
actually shipped to change.

  All materials used by IESS in its operations have good availability at this
time.  The sector uses electricity and gas in its operations, which are
currently adequate in supply.  However, difficulties in obtaining any of the
aforementioned items could affect the results for IESS.

  Patent protection is important to the sector's business.  Reference is made to
the material under the heading "General" for information relating to patents and
trademarks and research and development activities with respect to this sector.

  The sector's headquarters are located in Northbrook, Illinois.  It also has
manufacturing operations located in Tempe, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; Harvard
and Elk Grove Village, Illinois; Elma, New York; Seguin, Texas; Tianjin, China;
Stotfold, England; Angers, France; Dublin, Ireland, and Penang, Malaysia.  The
business has closed or sold its component manufacturing facilities in
Schaumburg, Illinois, San Jose, Costa Rica and Carlisle, Pennsylvania.  It
transferred its Motorola Lighting Inc. facility in Lake Zurich to its new owner
upon the division's sale in the first quarter of 2000.


     Internet and Networking Group

  The Internet and Networking Group ("ING" or the "group") manufactures and
sells cable modems, cable access units, analog and digital transmission devices
and other data communication devices, as well as wireline networking

                                       7
<PAGE>

products like routers for carrying converged voice and data traffic. ING's
manufacturing occurs both inside and outside the United States. The majority of
distribution and sales occurs outside of the United States.

  There are a few customers that, collectively, the loss of, or a significant
reduction in purchases by, could have a material adverse effect on the group's
results.

  This group experiences widespread, intense competition from numerous
competitors ranging from some of the world's largest, diversified companies to
small, specialized firms.  Competitive factors for the group include: price;
technology offered; product performance, features, quality, availability and
warranty; the quality and availability of service; time-to-market and company
image.

  The group's backlog amounted to $164 million at December 31, 1999 and $166
million at December 31, 1998.  The 1999 backlog is believed to be generally
firm, and approximately 100% of that amount is expected to be shipped during
2000.  This forward-looking estimate of the firmness of such orders is subject
to future events, which may cause the percentage of the 1999 backlog actually
shipped to change.

  Materials and components required by this group are relatively dependable and
certain, but normal fluctuations in market demand and supply could cause
temporary, selective shortages.  Occasionally, shortages or extended delivery
periods have occurred in various component parts, the effects of which have
generally been industry-wide and short in duration.  Natural gas, electricity
and oil are the primary sources of energy necessary for the segment's
operations.  These types of energy are currently readily available, but
difficulties in obtaining any of the aforementioned items could affect the
segment's results.

  Patent protection is very important to the group's business.  Reference is
made to the material under the heading "General" for information relating to
patents and trademarks, research and development activities and seasonality of
business with respect to this group.

  This group's headquarters are located in Mansfield, Massachusetts, with
manufacturing facilities in Mansfield, Massachusetts and Singapore;
additionally, research development and administration offices are located in
Scotts Valley and Palo Alto, California; Arlington Heights and Naperville,
Illinois, and Mansfield, Massachusetts.

     Other Businesses

  The Network Management Group ("NMG" or the "group"), part of the
Communications Enterprise, is comprised of the Network Communications Division
and the Satellite Ventures Division.  NMG holds and manages investments in
wireless operating systems in a number of international jurisdictions and in
gateway companies for the Iridium(R) satellite communications network.

  Merger with General Instrument Corporation

  On January 5, 2000, Motorola and General Instrument Corporation completed
their previously announced merger.  The merger positions Motorola as a leader in
the convergence of voice, video and data technologies.  The new Broadband
Communications Sector will focus on solutions that deliver interactive
television, the Internet and cable modem business of Motorola's Internet and
Networking Group.  Through the merger Motorola also acquired a majority
ownership in Next Level Communications, Inc., which completed an initial public
offering in the fourth quarter of 1999.  For this year-end reporting, Motorola
continues to use the previous segments because management continued to make
operating decisions and assess performance based on these segments.  For a
description of Motorola's 2000 segment realignment, see the information included
under the "2000 Segment Realignment" section of "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" contained in the
appendix to Motorola's Proxy Statement for the 2000 annual meeting of
stockholders.

  Financial Information About Segments.  The response to this section of Item 1
incorporates by reference Note 10, "Information by Segment and Geographic
Region," of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the
appendix to Motorola's Proxy Statement for the 2000 annual meeting of
stockholders.

  Customers.  Motorola is not dependent for a material part of its overall
business upon a single or a very few customers.  Approximately 3.0 % of
Motorola's total sales and revenues in 1999 were received from various branches
and agencies, including the armed services, of the U.S. Government.  All
contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to cancellation at the
convenience of the Government.

                                       8
<PAGE>

  Government contractors, including Motorola, are routinely subjected to
numerous audits and investigations, which may be either civil or criminal in
nature.  The consequences of these audits and investigations may include
administrative action to suspend business dealings with the contractor and to
exclude it from receiving new business.  In addition, Motorola, like other
contractors, is internally reviewing aspects of its government contracting
operations, and, where appropriate, taking corrective actions and making
voluntary disclosures to the Government.  These audits and investigations could
adversely affect Motorola and its results.

  Backlog.  Motorola's aggregate backlog position, including the backlog
position of subsidiaries through which some of its business units operate, as of
the end of the last two fiscal years, was approximately as follows:

     December 31, 1999............................... $9.20 billion
     December 31, 1998............................... $7.16 billion

No backlog relating to the Iridium program exists at December 31, 1999 as a
result of the Iridium bankruptcy proceedings described elsewhere herein.  If
backlog relating to the Iridium program were removed from backlog at December
31, 1998, that number would decrease from $7.16 billion to $6.44 billion.

  Except as previously discussed in this Item 1(c), the orders supporting the
1999 backlog amounts shown in the foregoing table are believed to be generally
firm, and approximately 95% of orders on hand at December 31, 1999 are expected
to be shipped during 2000.  However, this is a forward-looking estimate of the
amount expected to be shipped, and future events may cause the percentage
actually shipped to change.

  Motorola uses the percentage-of-completion method to recognize revenues and
costs associated with most long-term contracts.  For contracts involving certain
technologies, revenues and profits, or parts thereof, are deferred until
technological feasibility is established and customer acceptance is obtained.
For other product sales, revenue is recognized at the time of shipment, and
reserves are established for price protection and cooperative marketing programs
with distributors.

  Research and Development. Motorola's business segments participate in very
competitive industries with constant changes in technology.  Throughout its
history, Motorola has relied, and continues to rely, primarily on its research
and development programs for the development of new products and its production
engineering capabilities for the improvement of existing products.  Technical
data and product application ideas are exchanged among Motorola's business
segments on a regular basis.  Management believes, looking forward, that
Motorola's commitment to research and development programs, both to improve
existing products and services and to develop new products and services,
together with its utilization of state-of-the-art technology, should allow each
of its segments to remain competitive.

  Research and development expenditures relating to new product development or
product improvement, other than customer-sponsored contracts, were approximately
$3.44 billion in 1999, $2.89 billion in 1998 and $2.75 billion in 1997.  In
addition, research funded under customer-sponsored contracts amounted to
approximately $108 million in 1999, $433 million in 1998 and $616 million in
1997.

  Approximately 19,900 professional employees were engaged in such research
activities (including customer-sponsored contracts) during 1999.

  Patents and Trademarks.  As of December 31, 1999, Motorola owned approximately
10,542 utility and design patents in the United States and 11,265 patents in
foreign countries.  These foreign patents are mostly counterparts of Motorola's
U.S. patents, but an increasing number result from research conducted outside
the United States and are originally filed in the country of origin.  During
1999, Motorola was granted 1,271 U.S. utility and design patents.  A number of
U.S. and foreign patents previously owned by Motorola were assigned to the
purchasers of certain businesses that were sold during 1999.  Many of the
patents owned by Motorola are used in its operations or licensed for use by
others, and Motorola is licensed to use certain patents owned by others.  In
some instances, certain of the patents licensed by Motorola to others have
generated significant amounts of revenue to Motorola.

Motorola has obtained registration of the "MOTOROLA" and "Stylized M Logo"
trademarks throughout the world for many products and services.  Worldwide
recognition of these marks has resulted in their categorization as "famous"
marks.  These marks are valuable corporate assets.  Certain other trademarks and
service marks of Motorola are registered in relevant markets.  Motorola's
increasing focus on marketing products directly to consumers is reflected in an
increasing emphasis on brand equity creation and protection.  In the consumer
brand arena, four separate target categories have been designated by the
ACCOMPLI(TM), TALKABOUT(R), TIMEPORT(TM)

                                       9
<PAGE>

and V.SERIES(TM) brands. Global registration and support for these new brands is
an ongoing priority. The DIGITAL DNA(TM) brand remains a strong and highly
visible presence in the semiconductor branding strategy.

  Environmental Quality.  Motorola operations are from time to time the subjects
of investigations, conferences, discussions and negotiations with various
federal, state and local environmental agencies with respect to the discharge or
cleanup of hazardous waste and compliance by those operations with environmental
laws and regulations.  The balance of the response to this section of Item 1
incorporates by reference the information contained under the caption
"Environmental and Legal" in Note 9, "Commitments and Contingencies: Other," of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the appendix to
Motorola's Proxy Statement for the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders.

  Miscellaneous.  At December 31, 1999, there were approximately 121,000
employees of Motorola and its subsidiaries.  The business of Motorola and its
industry segments has certain seasonal characteristics:  the Semiconductor
Products segment has tended to have stronger, seasonally-adjusted sales in the
first half of the year; and sales of products, such as wireless telephones and
pagers, in consumer markets tend to increase in the fourth quarter.  An increase
or decrease in large system orders in our infrastructure businesses could cause
volatility in orders, revenues and profits recognized in any particular period.

  Business Risk Factors.  Except for historical matters, the matters discussed
in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties.  Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
statements under the following headings; (i)  "Personal Communications Segment,"
about the allocation and regulation of frequencies, the impact from the loss of
key customers, the expected component shortages during 2000, expected shipments
during 2000, and the availability of supplies and labor; (ii)  "Network Systems
Segment," about the allocation and regulation of frequencies, the impact from
the loss of key customers, expected shipments during 2000, and the availability

  Motorola wishes to caution readers that in addition to the important factors
described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the following important factors, among
others, sometimes have affected, and in the future could affect, Motorola's
actual results and could cause Motorola's actual consolidated results during
2000, and beyond, to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-
looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Motorola:

  Changes in Laws Affecting Frequency

  .  The effects of, and changes in, laws and regulations and other activities
     of governments, agencies and similar organizations, including, but not
     limited to, those affecting frequency, use and availability of spectrum
     authorizations and licensing.

  Risks from Large System Contracts

  .  Risks related to the trend towards increasingly large system contracts for
     infrastructure equipment and the resulting reliance on large customers, the
     technological risks of such contracts, especially when the contracts
     involve new technology, and financial risks to Motorola under these
     contracts, including the difficulty of projecting costs associated with
     large contracts.

  Component Shortages

  .  Motorola's ability to meet customer demands depends in part on our ability
     to obtain timely delivery of

                                       10
<PAGE>

     parts and components from our suppliers. Motorola has experienced component
     shortages in the past, including components for wireless telephones, that
     have adversely affected our operations. Although Motorola works closely
     with our suppliers to avoid these types of shortages, there can be no
     assurances that Motorola will not continue to encounter these problems in
     the future.

  Demand for Customer Financing

  .  Increasing demand for customer financing of equipment sales, particularly
     infrastructure equipment, and the ability of Motorola to provide financing
     on competitive terms with other companies.

  Transition From Analog to Digital

  .  The ability of Motorola's wireless telephone business to continue its
     transition to digital technologies and successfully compete in that
     business and retain or gain market share. Motorola faces intense
     competition in these markets from both established companies and new
     entrants. Product life cycles can be short and new products are expensive
     to develop and bring to market.

  Development of New Products and Technologies

  .  The risks related to Motorola's significant investment in developing and
     introducing new products such as digital wireless telephones, two-way and
     voice paging, CDMA and other technologies for third-generation (3G)
     wireless, products for transmission of telephony and high-speed data over
     hybrid fiber coaxial cable systems, integrated digital radios, and
     semiconductor products. These risks include: difficulties and delays in the
     development, production, testing and marketing of products; customer
     acceptance of products, particularly as Motorola's focus on the consumer
     market increases; the development of industry standards; the significant
     amount of resources Motorola must devote to the development of new
     technology; and the ability of Motorola to differentiate its products and
     compete with other companies in the same market.

  Demand for Wireless Communications Equipment

  .  The need for continued significant demand for wireless communications
     equipment, including equipment of the type Motorola manufactures or is
     developing.

  Ability to Compete in Semiconductor Market

  .  The ability of Motorola's semiconductor business to compete in the highly
     competitive semiconductor market. Factors that could adversely affect
     Motorola's ability to compete include: production inefficiencies and higher
     costs related to underutilized facilities, including both wholly-owned and
     joint venture facilities; shortage of manufacturing capacity for some
     products; competitive factors, such as rival chip architectures, mix of
     products, acceptance of new products and price pressures; risk of inventory
     obsolescence due to shifts in market demand; the continued growth of
     embedded technologies and systems and Motorola's ability to compete in that
     market; and the effect of orders from Motorola's equipment businesses.

  Success and Impact of Increased Use of Foundry Manufacturing Capacity

  .  The ability of Motorola's semiconductor business to increase its
     utilization of foundry manufacturing capacity and the impact of such
     efforts on capital expenditures, production costs and the ability to
     satisfy delivery requirements.

  Risks Related to the Iridium System

  .  Unfavorable outcomes to any currently pending or future litigation
     involving the Iridium project.

  .  Difficulties, delays and unexpected liabilities or expenses encountered in
     connection with the implementation of Iridium's liquidation proceedings,
     including those encountered in finalizing and implementing the deorbiting
     process and in resolving any remaining obligations Motorola has under its
     agreements related to the Iridium project.

  .  Difficulties, delays and unexpected liabilities or expenses incurred in
     effectively reallocating resources that were previously dedicated to the
     Iridium project.

                                       11
<PAGE>

  Outcome of Litigation

  .  The outcome of pending and future litigation and the protection and
     validity of patents and other intellectual property rights. Patent and
     other intellectual property rights of Motorola are important competitive
     tools and many generate income under license agreements. There can be no
     assurances as to the favorable outcome of litigation or that intellectual
     property rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented in one
     or more countries.

  Integration of New Businesses

  .  The ability of Motorola to integrate its newly acquired businesses, and to
     achieve strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits.

  Recruitment and Retention of Employees

  .  The ability of Motorola to recruit and retain engineers and other highly
     skilled personnel needed to compete in an intensely competitive market and
     develop successful new products.

  Development of Acquired Technologies

  .  During 1998 and 1999, Motorola acquired controlling and non-controlling
     interests in several businesses that had technology that was not fully
     developed.  If the technology is not fully developed in a timely manner,
     Motorola's investments in such companies could be materially adversely
     impacted.

  Strategic Alliances

  .  Motorola's success in partnering with other industry leaders to meet
     customer product and service requirements, particularly in its
     communications businesses.

  Euro Conversion

Item 2:  Properties

  Motorola's principal executive offices are located at 1303 East Algonquin
Road, Schaumburg, Illinois 60196.  Its other major facilities in the United
States are located in Arlington Heights, Harvard, Libertyville, Northbrook and
Schaumburg, Illinois; Elma, New York; Phoenix, Chandler, Scottsdale, Mesa and
Tempe, Arizona; Boynton Beach and Plantation, Florida; Lawrenceville, Georgia;
Austin, Ft. Worth and Seguin, Texas; Mount Pleasant, Iowa; Mansfield,
Massachusetts, and San Jose, California.  Motorola also operates manufacturing
facilities and sales offices in many other countries.  (See "Item 1:  Business"
for information regarding the location of the principal manufacturing facilities
for each industry segment.)  Motorola owns 97 facilities (manufacturing, sales,
service and office), 52 of which are located in North America and 45 of which
are located in other countries.  Motorola leases 511 such facilities, 245 of
which are located in North America and 266 of which are located in other
countries.

  Motorola generally considers the productive capacity of the plants operated by
each of its industry segments adequate and suitable for the requirements of each
business group.  New semiconductor product manufacturing facilities are under
construction in Xi-Qing, China and an expansion of the semiconductor product
manufacturing facility in Chandler, Arizona is currently underway and expected
to be completed during the second quarter of 2000. A new manufacturing facility
in Jaguariuna, Brazil was completed during the third quarter of 1999. This new
facility is being shared by a number of Motorola business units within the
Communications Enterprise. In addition to these new manufacturing locations,
Motorola continues with the global expansion of software centers around the
world. During 1999 we opened software centers in Montreal, Canada and Krakow,
Poland and announced a planned expansion at the software center in Adelaide,
Australia.

  As part of Motorola's overall strategy to reduce operating costs and improve
the financial performance of the corporation, a number of businesses and
facilities were either sold or are currently up for sale.  In connection with
the sale of the Semiconductor Components Group of the Semiconductor Products
Sector during 1999 Motorola sold facilities in Phoenix, Arizona; Aizu, Japan;
Seremban, Malaysia; Guadalajara, Mexico, and Carmona, the Philippines.
Semiconductor facilities in Chung-Li, Taiwan and Paju, South Korea were also
sold during 1999.  Facilities that have been shut down and are currently up for
sale include facilities in Irvine, California; Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina; San Jose, Costa Rica, and two start-up facilities in Jaguariuna,
Brazil.  Additional sites that were shut down in 1998 and sold during 1999 are
located in Huntsville, Alabama and Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

  The extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies from plant
to plant and from time to time during the year.

Item 3: Legal Proceedings

  Motorola is currently a named defendant in seven cases arising out of alleged
groundwater, soil and air pollution in Phoenix and Scottsdale, Arizona.
McIntire et al. v. Motorola remains pending in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Arizona, while Baker et al. v. Motorola et al., Lofgren et al. v.
Motorola et al., Bentancourt et al. v. Motorola et al., Ford et al. v. Motorola
et al., Wilkins et al. v. Motorola et al and Dawson et al. v. Motorola, et al.
are pending in the Arizona Superior Court, Maricopa County.  The McIntire
lawsuit, filed on December 20, 1991, involves approximately 920 plaintiffs who
allege that the operations of Motorola at several facilities in Phoenix and
Scottsdale, Arizona have caused property damage and health problems by
contaminating the soil, groundwater and air in the area surrounding those
facilities.  The Baker lawsuit, filed on February 11, 1992, is a class action,
involving six representative individual named plaintiffs, alleging that Motorola
and a number of other defendants contaminated the soil, air and groundwater in
the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, diminishing property values and exposing members of
the class to possible adverse health effects.  On August 24, 1994, the Baker
court certified two classes, a property damage class consisting of all persons
who since 1987 were residents, property owners or lessees of property which
overlies, or is adjacent to, the alleged groundwater pollution, and a medical
monitoring class consisting of all persons who resided in Phoenix and/or
Scottsdale for more than one year continuously during the years between 1955 and
1989, and who received potable drinking water containing trichloroethylene at a
level equal to or exceeding 2.0 parts per billion, on average. Motorola is now
the sole remaining defendant in the property claims in Scottsdale and East
Phoenix.

                                       13
<PAGE>

     The Lofgren, Bentancourt, Ford, Wilkins and Dawson lawsuits, filed on April
6, 1993, July 16, 1993, June 10, 1994, July 19, 1995 and August 7, 1997,
respectively, were consolidated. The consolidated cases involved more than 200
plaintiffs, alleging that Motorola and a number of other defendants contaminated
the soil, air and groundwater in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, causing health
problems. On June 1, 1998, the Lofgren court ruled inadmissible proffered
testimony from each of the plaintiffs' medical causation experts and granted
summary judgment on those personal injury claims in favor of Motorola and the
other remaining defendants. An appeal is expected after the court formally
enters final judgment.

     All seven pending lawsuits described above seek compensatory and punitive
damages. The McIntire complaint includes personal injury and property damage
claims and seeks injunctive relief. The Baker complaint seeks damages for
medical monitoring and alleges claims for property, business and economic loss
and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. The consolidated Lofgren cases
involve claims for personal injury.

     A class action, In Re Nextel Communications Securities Litigation, against
Nextel Communications, Inc., certain of its officers and directors and Motorola
for alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5, is pending in the United States District Court
for the District of New Jersey. The pending complaint, a consolidation of cases
previously filed against Nextel, was filed on July 11, 1995 and maintains that
the defendants artificially inflated the price of Nextel common stock through a
series of alleged misrepresentations and omissions. Plaintiffs propose a class
period of July 22, 1993 through January 10, 1995 and seek an unspecified amount
of monetary damages. On February 17, 2000, the parties entered into a
stipulation of settlement. The hearing of the proposed settlement is scheduled
for June 15, 2000.

     Motorola and several of its officers and directors are named defendants in
a consolidated class action, Kaufman, et. al. v Motorola, Inc., et. al., for
alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
and SEC Rule 10b-5. The case was filed on May 19, 1995 and is pending in the
U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiffs claim that
Motorola and the individual defendants inflated the price of Motorola stock by
failing to timely disclose a buildup of cellular phone inventory with its
distributors. The district court has certified a class consisting of purchasers
of Motorola common stock during the period of November 4, 1994 through February
17, 1995. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages. A recent trial date
of March 6, 2000 was vacated and no new trial date has been set.

     Motorola has been a defendant in several cases arising out of its
manufacture and sale of portable cellular telephones. Jerald P. Busse, et al. v.
Motorola, Inc. et al., filed on October 26, 1995 in the Circuit Court of Cook
County, Illinois, Chancery Division, is a purported class action alleging that
defendants have failed to adequately warn consumers of the alleged dangers of
cellular telephones and challenging ongoing safety studies as invasions of
privacy. All claims were dismissed on defendants' motion. Upon plaintiffs'
motion for reconsideration, the Court allowed the plaintiffs to replead the
invasion of privacy claims. Defendants have once again filed a motion for
summary judgment. Kane, et al., v. Motorola, Inc., et al., filed on December 13,
1993 in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleges that plaintiffs'
brain cancer was caused by or aggravated by a prototype communication device.
Medica et al., v. Motorola, Inc., et el., filed September 7, 1999, alleges that
use of a Motorola cellular phone caused plaintiff Phil Medica's malignant brain
tumor.

     On October 16, 1998, the plaintiffs in Pennsylvania Bancshares, Inc. et al.
v. Motorola, Inc., et al., a purported class action filed on October 10, 1995 in
the Court of Common Pleas, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, filed a notice of
voluntary dismissal with prejudice as to all claims for monetary relief and
without prejudice as to all claims for equitable relief. Plaintiffs alleged that
Motorola systematically engages in deceptive trade practices, including without
limitation, intentionally misrepresenting the quality of certain types of
cellular telephones. The dismissal is currently before the court for decision.
Silber, et al. v. Motorola, Inc., et al., filed on August 1, 1995 in the Supreme
Court of The State of New York, County of Suffolk, which was transferred from
the County of New York, is an action wherein it is alleged that a traffic
accident was caused by the use of a cellular phone. On April 27, 1999, Motorola
obtained summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims. Plaintiffs have appealed.

     Motorola has been named as one of several defendants in a number of nearly
identical putative class action securities lawsuits arising out of alleged
material misrepresentations or omissions regarding difficulties in the satellite
communications business of Iridium World Communications, LTD, Iridium LLC and
Iridium Operating LLC. Freeland v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et al.,
Yong v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et al., Kleinman v. Iridium World
Communications, LTD, et al., Marshall v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et
al., Ackerman v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et al., Hargrove v. Iridium

Communications, LTD, et al., Strougo v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et
al., and Garvin v. Iridium World Communications, LTD, et al., have all been
filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. The alleged classes
consist of purchasers of Iridium securities during the period from July 14, 1998
to May 13, 1999. A motion to consolidate the cases is currently pending. As a
result of bankruptcy proceedings regarding Iridium LLC and other Iridium
business entities, these cases have been stayed as to the Iridium business
defendants but are continuing as to Motorola and all other defendants. In
addition, Motorola has been named as a defendant in Andrews, et al. v. Iridium
World Communications, LTD, et al., in the Superior Court of California (San
Diego). The approximately 42 plaintiffs were purchasers of Iridium securities
and allege violations of California law relating to securities.

Note 9, "Commitments and Contingencies: Other," of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in the appendix to Motorola's Proxy Statement for
the 2000 annual meeting of stockholders is incorporated herein by reference.

     Motorola is a defendant in various other suits, claims and investigations
which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the
ultimate disposition of these matters, including those matters described above
in this Item 3, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
financial position, liquidity or results of operations of Motorola.

Item 4:  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     Not applicable.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Motorola, Inc.

     Under date of January 17, 2000, except as to Note 15, which is as of March
17, 2000, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of Motorola, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 1999, as contained in the 1999
proxy statement to stockholders. These consolidated financial statements and our
report thereon are incorporated by reference in the annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 1999. In connection with our audits of the
aforementioned consolidated financial statements, we also audited the related
financial statement schedule as listed in Part IV, Item 14(a)2. The financial

                             THE MOTOROLA OMNIBUS

                            INCENTIVE PLAN OF 2000


     1.  Purpose.  The purposes of the Motorola Omnibus Incentive Plan of 2000
         -------
(the "Plan") are (i) to encourage outstanding individuals to accept or continue
employment with Motorola, Inc. ("Motorola") and its subsidiaries or to serve as
directors of Motorola, and (ii) to furnish maximum incentive to those persons to
improve operations and increase profits and to strengthen the mutuality of
interest between those persons and Motorola's stockholders by providing them
stock options and other stock and cash incentives.

     2.  Administration.  The Plan will be administered by a Committee (the
         --------------
"Committee") of the Motorola Board of Directors consisting of two or more
directors as the Board may designate from time to time, each of whom shall
qualify as a "Non-Employee Director" within the meaning set forth in Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act") or any successor legislation.  The Committee shall have the authority to
construe and interpret the Plan and any benefits granted thereunder, to
establish and amend rules for Plan administration, to change the terms and
conditions of options and other benefits at or after grant, and to make all
other determinations which it deems necessary or advisable for the
administration of the Plan.  The determinations of the Committee shall be made
in accordance with their judgment as to the best interests of Motorola and its
stockholders and in accordance with the purposes of the Plan.  A majority of the
members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum, and all determinations of
the Committee shall be made by a majority of its members.  Any determination of
the Committee under the Plan may be made without notice or meeting of the
Committee, in writing signed by all the Committee members.  The Committee may
delegate the administration of the Plan, in whole or in part, on such terms and
conditions as it may impose, to such other person or persons as it may determine
in its discretion, except with respect to benefits to officers subject to
Section 16 of the Exchange Act or officers who are or may be "covered employees"
within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Covered
Employees").

     3.  Participants.  Participants may consist of all employees of Motorola
         ------------
and its subsidiaries and all Non-Employee Directors of Motorola.  Any
corporation or other entity in which a 50% or greater interest is at the time
directly or indirectly owned by Motorola shall be a subsidiary for purposes of
the Plan.  Designation of a participant in any year shall not require the
Committee to designate that person to receive a benefit in any other year or to
receive the same type or amount of benefit as granted to the participant in any
other year or as granted to any other participant in any year.  The Committee
shall consider all factors which it deems relevant in selecting participants and
in determining the type and amount of their respective benefits.

     4.  Shares Available under the Plan.  There is hereby reserved for issuance
         -------------------------------
under the Plan an aggregate of 35,700,000 shares of Motorola common stock.  If
there is a lapse, expiration, termination or cancellation of any stock option
issued under the Plan prior to the issuance of shares thereunder or if shares of
common stock are issued under the Plan and thereafter are reacquired by
Motorola, the shares subject to those options and the reacquired

                                       1
<PAGE>

shares shall be added to the shares available for benefits under the Plan. In
addition, any shares of common stock exchanged by an optionee as full or partial
payment to Motorola of the exercise price under any stock option exercised under
the Plan, any shares retained by Motorola pursuant to a participant's tax
withholding election, and any shares covered by a benefit which is settled in
cash shall be added to the shares available for benefits under the Plan. All
shares issued under the Plan may be either authorized and unissued shares or
issued shares reacquired by Motorola. Under the Plan, no participant may receive
in any calendar year (i) Stock Options relating to more than 1,000,000 shares,
(ii) Restricted Stock that is subject to the attainment of Performance Goals of
Section 13 hereof relating to more than 100,000 shares, (iii) Stock Appreciation
Rights relating to more than 1,000,000 shares, or (iv) Performance Shares
relating to more than 100,000 shares. The shares reserved for issuance and the
limitations set forth above shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with
Section 15 hereof. All of the available shares may, but need not, be issued
pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options. Notwithstanding anything
else contained in this Section 4 the number of shares which may be issued under
the Plan for benefits other than stock options shall not exceed a total of
3,000,000 shares (subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 15 hereof).

     5.  Types of Benefits.  Benefits under the Plan shall consist of Stock
         -----------------
Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock, Performance Stock,
Performance Units, Annual Management Incentive Awards and Other Stock or Cash
Awards, all as described below.

     6.  Stock Options.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Stock Options may be
         -------------
granted to participants, at any time as determined by the Committee.  The
Committee shall determine the number of shares subject to each option and
whether the option is an Incentive Stock Option.  The option price for each
option shall be determined by the Committee but shall not be less than 100% of
the fair market value of Motorola's common stock on the date the option is
granted.  Each option shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine
at the time of grant.  Options shall be exercisable at such time and subject to
such terms and conditions as the Committee shall determine; provided, however,
that no option shall be exercisable later than the tenth anniversary of its
grant.  The option price, upon exercise of any option, shall be payable to
Motorola in full by (a) cash payment or its equivalent, (b) tendering previously
acquired shares (held for at least six months) having a fair market value at the
time of exercise equal to the option price, (c) certification of ownership of
such previously-acquired shares, (d) delivery of a properly executed exercise
notice, together with irrevocable instructions to a broker to promptly deliver
to Motorola the amount of sale proceeds from the option shares or loan proceeds
to pay the exercise price and any withholding taxes due to Motorola, and (e)
such other methods of payment as the Committee, at its discretion, deems
appropriate.  In no event shall the Committee cancel any outstanding Stock
Option for the purpose of reissuing the option to the participant at a lower
exercise price or reduce the option price of an outstanding option.

     7.  Stock Appreciation Rights.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Stock
         -------------------------
Appreciation Rights ("SARs") may be granted to participants at any time as
determined by the Committee.  An SAR may be granted in tandem with a Stock
Option granted under this Plan or on a free-standing basis.  The grant price of
a tandem SAR shall be equal to the option price of the related option.  The
grant price of a free-standing SAR shall be equal to the fair market value of
Motorola's common stock on the date of its grant.  An SAR may be exercised upon
such terms and conditions and for the term as the Committee in its sole
discretion determines; provided, however, that the term shall not exceed the
option term in the case of a tandem SAR or ten years

                                       2
<PAGE>

in the case of a free standing SAR. Upon exercise of an SAR, the participant
shall be entitled to receive payment from Motorola in cash or stock, at the
discretion of the Committee, in an amount determined by multiplying the excess
of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over
the grant price of the SAR by the number of shares with respect to which the SAR
is exercised.

     8.   Restricted Stock.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, Restricted Stock
          ----------------
may be awarded or sold to participants under such terms and conditions as shall
be established by the Committee.  Restricted Stock shall be subject to such
restrictions as the Committee determines, including, without limitation, any of
the following:

          (a) a prohibition against sale, assignment, transfer, pledge,
          hypothecation or other encumbrance of the shares of Restricted Stock
          for a specified period; or

          (b) a requirement that the holder of Restricted Stock forfeit (or in
          the case of shares sold to the participant resell to Motorola at cost)
          such shares in the event of termination of employment during the
          period of restriction.

All restrictions shall expire at such times as the Committee shall specify.

     9.   Performance Stock.  Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee
          -----------------
shall designate the participants to whom long-term performance stock
("Performance Stock") is to be awarded and determine the number of shares, the
length of the performance period and the other terms and conditions of each such
award.  Each award of Performance Stock shall entitle the participant to a
payment in the form of shares of common stock upon the attainment of performance
goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee.

          Notwithstanding satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of
shares issued under a Performance Stock award may be adjusted by the Committee
on the basis of such further consideration as the Committee in its sole
discretion shall determine.  However, the Committee may not, in any event,
increase the number of shares earned upon satisfaction of any performance goal
by any participant who is a Covered Employee.  The Committee may, in its
discretion, make a cash payment equal to the fair market value of shares of
common stock otherwise required to be issued to a participant pursuant to a
Performance Stock award.

     10.  Performance Units.   Subject to the terms of the Plan, the Committee
          -----------------
shall designate the participants to whom long-term performance units
("Performance Units") are to be awarded and determine the number of units and
the terms and conditions of each such award.  Each Performance Unit award shall
entitle the participant to a payment in cash upon the attainment of performance
goals and other terms and conditions specified by the Committee.

          Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the amount
to be paid under a Performance Unit award may be adjusted by the Committee on
the basis of such further consideration as the Committee in its sole discretion
shall determine.  However, the Committee may not, in any event, increase the
amount earned under Performance Unit awards upon satisfaction of any performance
goal by any participant who is a Covered Employee and the maximum amount earned
by a Covered Employee in any calendar year may not exceed $5,000,000.  The
Committee may, in its discretion, substitute actual shares of common stock for
the cash payment otherwise required to be made to a participant pursuant to a
Performance Unit award.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     11.  Annual Management Incentive Awards.  The Committee may designate
          ----------------------------------
Motorola executive officers who are eligible to receive a monetary payment in
any calendar year based on a percentage of an incentive pool equal to 5% of
Motorola's consolidated operating earnings for the calendar year.  The Committee
shall allocate an incentive pool percentage to each designated participant for
each calendar year.  In no event may the incentive pool percentage for any one
participant exceed 30% of the total pool.  Consolidated operating earnings shall
mean the consolidated earnings before income taxes of the Company, computed in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, but shall exclude the
effects of Extraordinary Items.  Extraordinary Items shall mean (i)
extraordinary, unusual and/or non-recurring items of gain or loss (ii) gains or
losses on the disposition of a business, (iii) changes in tax or accounting
regulations or laws, or (iv) the effect of a merger or acquisition, all of which
must be identified in the audited financial statements, including footnotes, or
the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the Company's annual report.

          As soon as possible after the determination of the incentive pool for
a Plan year, the Committee shall calculate the participant's allocated portion
of the incentive pool based upon the percentage established at the beginning of
the calendar year.  The participant's incentive award then shall be determined
by the Committee based on the participant's allocated portion of the incentive
pool subject to adjustment in the sole discretion of the Committee.  In no event
may the portion of the incentive pool allocated to a participant who is a
Covered Employee be increased in any way, including as a result of the reduction
of any other participant's allocated portion.

     12.  Other Stock or Cash Awards.  In addition to the incentives described
          --------------------------
in sections 6 through 11 above, and subject to the terms of the Plan, the
Committee may grant other incentives payable in cash or in common stock under
the Plan as it determines to be in the best interests of Motorola and subject to
such other terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.

     13.  Performance Goals.  Awards of Restricted Stock, Performance Stock,
          -----------------
Performance Units and other incentives under the Plan may be made subject to the
attainment of performance goals relating to one or more business criteria within
the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, including, but not
limited to, cash flow; cost; ratio of debt to debt plus equity; profit before
tax; earnings before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization; earnings per share; operating earnings; economic
value added; ratio of operating earnings to capital spending; free cash flow;
net profit; net sales; price of Company Stock; return on net assets, equity or
stockholders' equity; market share; or total return to shareholders
("Performance Criteria").  Any Performance Criteria may be used to measure the
performance of the Company as a whole or any business unit of the Company.  Any
Performance Criteria may include or exclude Extraordinary Items.  Performance
Criteria shall be calculated in accordance with the Company's financial
statements, generally accepted accounting principles, or under a methodology
established by the Committee prior to the issuance of an award which is
consistently applied and identified in the audited financial statements,
including footnotes, or the Management Discussion and Analysis section of the
Company's annual report.  However, the Committee may not in any event increase
the amount of compensation payable to a Covered Employee upon the attainment of
a performance goal.

     14.  Change in Control.  Except as otherwise determined by the Committee at
          -----------------
the time of grant of an award, upon a Change in Control of Motorola, all
outstanding Stock Options and SARs shall become vested and exercisable; all
restrictions on Restricted Stock shall lapse; all

                                       4
<PAGE>

performance goals shall be deemed achieved at target levels and all other terms
and conditions met; all Performance Stock shall be delivered; all Performance
Units shall be paid out as promptly as practicable; all Annual Management
Incentive Awards shall be paid out based on the consolidated operating earnings
of the immediately preceding year or such other method of payment as may be
determined by the Committee at the time of award or thereafter but prior to the
Change in Control; and all Other Stock or Cash Awards shall be delivered or
paid. A "Change in Control" shall mean:

               A Change in Control of a nature that would be required to be
          reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A
          promulgated under the Exchange Act whether or not Motorola is then
          subject to such reporting requirement; provided that, without
          limitation, such a Change in Control shall be deemed to have occurred
          if (a) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Section
          13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the "beneficial
          owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or
          indirectly, of securities of Motorola representing 20% or more of the
          combined voting power of Motorola's then outstanding securities (other
          than Motorola or any employee benefit plan of Motorola; and, for
          purposes of the Plan, no Change in Control shall be deemed to have
          occurred as a result of the "beneficial ownership," or changes
          therein, of Motorola's securities by either of the foregoing), (b)
          there shall be consummated (i) any consolidation or merger of Motorola
          in which Motorola is not the surviving or continuing corporation or
          pursuant to which shares of common stock would be converted into or
          exchanged for cash, securities or other property, other than a merger
          of Motorola in which the holders of common stock immediately prior to
          the merger have, directly or indirectly, at least a 65% ownership
          interest in the outstanding common stock of the surviving corporation
          immediately after the merger, or (ii) any sale, lease, exchange or
          other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related
          transactions) of all, or substantially all, of the assets of Motorola
          other than any such transaction with entities in which the holders of
          Motorola Common Stock, directly or indirectly, have at least a 65%
          ownership interest, (c) the stockholders of Motorola approve any plan
          or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of Motorola, or (d) as
          the result of, or in connection with, any cash tender offer, exchange
          offer, merger or other business combination, sale of assets, proxy or
          consent solicitation (other than by the Board), contested election or
          substantial stock accumulation (a "Control Transaction"), the members
          of the Board immediately prior to the first public announcement
          relating to such Control Transaction shall thereafter cease to
          constitute a majority of the Board

     15.  Adjustment Provisions.
          ---------------------

          (a)  If Motorola shall at any time change the number of issued shares
          of common stock by stock dividend or stock split, the total number of
          shares reserved for issuance under the Plan, the maximum number of
          shares which may be made subject to an award in any calendar year, and
          the number of shares covered by each outstanding award and the price
          therefor, if any, shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee, in its
          sole discretion.

                                       5
<PAGE>

          (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 14, without affecting the
          number of shares reserved or available hereunder the Board of
          Directors or the Committee may authorize the issuance or assumption of
          benefits under this Plan in connection with any merger, consolidation,
          acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization upon such terms
          and conditions as it may deem appropriate.

          (c) In the event of any merger, consolidation or reorganization of
          Motorola with or into another corporation, other than a merger,
          consolidation or reorganization in which Motorola is the continuing
          corporation and which does not result in the outstanding common stock
          being converted into or exchanged for different securities, cash or
          other property, or any combination thereof, there shall be
          substituted, on an equitable basis as determined by the Committee in
          its discretion, for each share of common stock then subject to a
          benefit granted under the Plan, the number and kind of shares of
          stock, other securities, cash or other property to which holders of
          common stock of Motorola will be entitled pursuant to the transaction.

     16.  Nontransferability.  Each benefit granted under the Plan shall not be
          ------------------
transferable otherwise than by will or the laws of descent and distribution and
each Stock Option and SAR shall be exercisable during the participant's lifetime
only by the participant or, in the event of disability, by the participant's
personal representative.  In the event of the death of a participant, exercise
of any benefit or payment with respect to any benefit shall be made only by or
to the executor or administrator of the estate of the deceased participant or
the person or persons to whom the deceased participant's rights under the
benefit shall pass by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, at its discretion, the Committee may permit the
transfer of a Stock Option by the participant, subject to such terms and
conditions as may be established by the Committee.

     17.  Taxes.  Motorola shall be entitled to withhold the amount of any tax
          -----
attributable to any amounts payable or shares deliverable under the Plan, after
giving the person entitled to receive such payment or delivery notice and
Motorola may defer making payment or delivery as to any award, if any such tax
is payable until indemnified to its satisfaction.  The Committee may, in its
discretion, subject to such rules as it may adopt, permit a participant to pay
all or a portion of any required withholding taxes arising in connection with
the exercise of a Stock Option or SAR or the receipt or vesting of shares
hereunder by electing to have Motorola withhold shares of common stock, having a
fair market value equal to the amount to be withheld.

     18.  Duration, Amendment and Termination.  No Incentive Stock Option shall
          -----------------------------------
be granted more than ten years after the date of adoption of this Plan by the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that the terms and conditions applicable
to any benefit granted on or before such date may thereafter be amended or
modified by mutual agreement between Motorola and the participant, or such other
person as may then have an interest therein.  The Board of Directors or the
Committee may amend the Plan from time to time or terminate the Plan at any
time.  However, no such action shall reduce the amount of any existing award or
change the terms and conditions thereof without the participant's consent.  No
amendment of the Plan shall be made without stockholder approval if stockholder
approval is required by law, regulation, or stock exchange rule.
