                   JERRY FISHMAN BECOMES ANALOG DEVICES' CEO

NORWOOD, MA -- Analog Devices (NYSE: ADI) today announced that Jerald G.
Fishman, Analog's President and Chief Operating Officer, will become the
company's President and Chief Executive Officer effective November 2nd, the
last day of the company's current fiscal year. He succeeds Ray Stata, the
company's founder, Chairman of the Board and CEO. Mr. Stata will continue
serving Analog Devices as full-time Chairman of the Board.

Mr. Fishman began his career at Analog Devices in 1972 in product marketing.
Over the next several years he held a series of management positions in
marketing, operations and strategic planning, which led to being named General
Manager of the Analog Devices Semiconductor Division in 1979. He was elected
Vice President in 1980, Group Vice President in 1982, Executive Vice President
in 1988, and President and COO in 1991. He holds a BSEE from the City College
of New York, an MSEE from Northeastern University, an MBA from Boston University
and a Juris Doctor degree from Suffolk Law School.

"Jerry's promotion to CEO is the capstone of a corporate restructuring and
management development process that we initiated in 1990," said Mr. Stata.
"Since that time, we have completely restructured the company to better serve
high-growth opportunities in the communications, computer and automotive
markets, while improving our strong market position in standard linear ICs.

"Changes during this period," he continued, "include the replacement of our
traditional geography-based divisions with divisions focused on our served
markets and the establishment of a centralized worldwide manufacturing
organization. We have also developed new core technologies in digital signal
processing, radio frequency signal processing and surface micromachining to
augment our long-proven technical expertise in precision linear and data
conversion technology. A key part of this process has been the development of a
new generation of managers that is very capable and committed to Analog's
continued success."

Mr. Fishman commented, "this is a very exciting time to be named Analog's next
CEO. The growth in both revenues and profits that we have achieved over the
past five years provides clear evidence that our business strategy of focusing
solely on real-world signal processing is working. We believe we have the
market opportunities, technology, product base, financial resources and
organization in place to continue growing profitably into the 21st century
simply by continuing to do even better what we have already shown we can do very
well. I am personally excited by the prospect of Analog Devices becoming a much
larger company over the next few years and I, along with the rest of our senior
management team, are committed to doing everything we can to achieve that goal."

Safe harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995: Forward-looking statements in this news release involve risk and
uncertainty. Important factors, including overall economic conditions, demand
for semiconductors generally, demand for the company's products, raw material
availability (especially raw silicon wafers), availability of manufacturing
capacity, technological and product development risks, competitors' actions and
other risk factors described in the Company's filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially.

Analog Devices is a leading manufacturer of precision high-performance 
integrated circuits used in analog and digital signal processing applications.
Revenues for the first three quarters of fiscal 1996 totaled $889 million, vs.
$684 million for the same period in fiscal 1995. Analog expects to report its
fiscal 1996 results on December 4th. Headquartered in Norwood, Massachusetts,
the company employs approximately 6,900 people worldwide and has manufacturing
facilities in Massachusetts, California, North Carolina, Ireland, the
Philippines and Taiwan.
