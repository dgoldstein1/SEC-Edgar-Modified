                                    PART I


ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

GENERAL

Xilinx,  Inc.  ("Xilinx"  or  "the  Company")  designs,  develops  and markets
complementary  metal-oxide-silicon  ("CMOS")  programmable  logic  devices and
related development system software.  The Company's programmable logic product
lines  include  field  programmable  gate  arrays  ("FPGAs")  and  complex
programmable  logic  devices  ("CPLDs").    These  components  are  standard
integrated  circuits  ("ICs")  programmed  by  Xilinx's  customers  to perform
desired  logic  operations.   Xilinx introduced the first FPGA device in 1985,
holds patents on certain FPGA architectures and technology and continues to be
the  leading  supplier  to this market.  Xilinx also markets hardwire devices,
which are mask-programmed ICs that are functionally equivalent to a programmed
FPGA.

Competitive  pressures  require  manufacturers  of electronic systems to bring
increasingly  complex  products  to market rapidly.  Requirements for improved
functionality,  performance,  reliability  and  lower cost are often addressed
through  the  use  of  components  that  integrate  ever  larger  numbers  of
transistors  onto  a  single  integrated  circuit.    For electronic equipment
manufacturers  in  the  data  processing,  telecommunications,  networking,
industrial  control,  instrumentation, and military markets, integration often
results  in  faster  speed,  smaller  size,  lower power consumption and lower
costs.    However,  while global competition is increasing the demand for more
complex products, it is also shortening product life cycles and requiring more
frequent  product  enhancements.  The length of time required to develop these
more  sophisticated  electronic  systems  is often incompatible with stringent
time to market requirements.

Xilinx  was founded to design, develop and market FPGAs which uniquely combine
the  high  logic density typically associated with custom gate arrays with the
time  to  market  advantages  of  programmable logic and the availability of a
standard  product.    The  Company offers a broad product line of programmable
logic  devices  to provide solutions for customers. The Company's programmable
logic  devices  serve a wide variety of applications which require high levels
of  integration  and  for which time to market is critical, production volumes
are  unpredictable and/or frequent design modifications are necessary to adapt
a  product  to  new  markets.    Xilinx  CPLD's  complement the Company's FPGA
products  and  contribute to the Company's efforts to offer total programmable
logic  solutions.    With  FPGAs, which have the advantages of higher density,
lower  power and lower cost, and CPLDs, which are typically faster, have lower
density  and  have  simpler,  easier  to  use software, the Company's products
enable  electronic  system  manufacturers to rapidly bring complex products to
market in volume.

The Xilinx software strategy is to deliver an integrated design solution for a
broad customer base ranging from customers who are not familiar with designing
systems using FPGA's to the most sophisticated customers who are accustomed to
designing  high  density,  mask  programmed  gate arrays.  The objective is to
deliver  strategic  software  advantages  that combine ease of use with design
flexibility, effective silicon utilization and competitive performance.

System  designers  use proprietary Xilinx development system software together
with  industry  standard  electronic design automation ("EDA") tools to design
and  develop  Xilinx  programmable  logic  applications.  Designers define the
logic  functions  of  the  circuit  and  revise  such functions as necessary. 
Programmable  logic  can be designed and verified in a few days, as opposed to
several weeks or months for gate arrays, which are customized devices that are
defined  during the manufacturing process. Moreover, programmable logic design
changes can be implemented in as little as a few hours, as compared to several
weeks  for  a custom gate array.  In addition, significant savings result from
the  elimination  of  non-recurring  engineering  costs  and  the reduction of
expenses  associated  with the redesign and testing of custom gate arrays.  By
reducing  the  cost  and  scheduling  risks of design iterations, programmable
logic  devices  allow greater designer creativity, including the consideration
of  design  alternatives  which  often lead to product improvements.  Further,
since  programmable  logic  devices  are  standard  products  and  production
quantities  are more readily available, exposures to obsolete inventory can be
significantly reduced.

On  April  10,  1995,  the Company acquired NeoCAD, Inc. ("NeoCAD"), a company
engaged  in  the  design,  development,  and sale of software design tools for
programmable  electronic  technologies.   In fiscal 1996, the Company has been
integrating  NeoCAD's  advanced  FPGA software technology into its development
system software.

Xilinx  was  organized in California in February 1984 and in November 1985 was
reorganized  to  incorporate its research and development limited partnership.
In  April  1990,  the  Company  reincorporated  in  Delaware.    The Company's
corporate  facilities  and  executive offices are located at 2100 Logic Drive,
San Jose, California 95124.

PRODUCTS

The  timely introduction of new products is a key factor in the success of the
Company's  business.    Delays  in  developing  new  products with anticipated
technological  advances  or  delays  in  commencing  volume  shipments  of new
products  would  be  expected  to  have  an  adverse  effect  on the Company's
business.    In  addition,  there  can  be no assurance that such products, if
introduced,  will  gain  market  acceptance  or  respond  effectively  to  new
technological changes or new product announcements by others.

     Programmable Logic Devices

The Company's FPGA products include the XC2000, XC3000 and XC4000 families and
the  recently  introduced  XC5000,  XC6000 and XC8000 families.  The Company's
CPLD  products  include  the  XC7000 family and the recently introduced XC9000
family.    The  Company has also recently introduced new members of the XC4000
family  which  include the XC4000E and XC4000EX.  The XC4000E family increased
performance over previous versions of the XC4000 family by approximately fifty
percent.    This  improvement  is  the  result  of a new design, a new process
technology  and  new  on-chip  RAM  features. The XC4000EX family utilizes the
benefits of the XC4000E architecture and provides additional routing resources
which are expected to meet the design requirements for ICs with gate densities
ranging  from 28,000 to 125,000 useable gates.  The XC4000EX family will offer
the  most  powerful  solution  for  the mask-programmed gate array replacement
market  by  addressing  80% of the density requirements for today's gate array
design  starts.    The  XC5000  family  represents the first FPGA specifically
developed  as  a  cost  effective,  high volume production alternative to gate
arrays.    The  XC5000  family  significantly  reduces  the  price premium for
customers  evaluating  an FPGA device against a comparable custom gate array. 
Use  of the XC5000 as a low cost solution for high density designs permits the
customer  to  also  take  advantage  of  design ease and to accelerate time to
volume  production.    The  XC6000  family  is  designed  for  reconfigurable
coprocessing  applications  within  the embedded controller market. The XC8000
family  consists  of  one-time  programmable FPGAs which utilize the Company's
innovative  MicroVia  antifuse  technology  and  proprietary  sea-of-gates
architecture  and was developed for high gate efficiency and ease-of-use.  The
XC9000  family  utilizes  Flash-based  architecture  and  offers  in-system
programmability.    The  Company shipped XC4000E and XC8000 products in fiscal
1996  and  expects  to ship the XC4000EX, XC6000 and XC9000 products in fiscal
1997.

FPGAs  are  available  in a wide variety of plastic and ceramic package types,
including  pin-grid  array,  surface  mount and quad flat pack configurations.
These  devices  meet  the  industry  standard  operating temperature ranges of
commercial, industrial and military users.

The  Company's  hardwire  products  offer  a  low cost migration path for high
volume applications.  Once a programmable logic design is finalized, customers
can  take  advantage of hardwire products which are mask-programmed during the
manufacturing process.  For every Xilinx FPGA family, there is a corresponding
hardwire family.

In  order  to  minimize  the  printed circuit board area required for external
storage  of the FPGA configuration program, the Company has developed a family
of  erasable  programmable  read-only  memories ("EPROMs").  These devices are
sold by the Company in conjunction with its FPGAs.

     Development System Software

The  Company's  current  version  of  XACTstep  software  combines  powerful
technology  with  a  flexible, easy to use graphical interface to help achieve
the  best  possible  designs.    XACTstep  provides  all of the implementation
technology  required  to  design  with  Xilinx logic devices, including module
generation,  design  optimization  and  mapping, placement and routing, timing
analysis, and program file generation.  The Company's next generation software
will  build  upon the existing user interface of the current XACTstep software
release,  but  underneath  will be a new generation software platform based on
the  NeoCAD  core  technologies.  This merged release, which is expected to be
available in fiscal 1997, is designed to satisfy the complete spectrum of FPGA
and CPLD customers.

The  Company currently offers two different series of software solutions.  One
series,  which  was  released  in  April  1996,  is  an  off-the-shelf,  or
"shrink-wrapped", solution that is easy to learn and use.  For those customers
that  are  new to designing with PLDs or want a low cost solution, the Company
offers  this  entirely integrated software solution.  The second series is for
designers  who want to integrate programmable logic design into their existing
EDA  tool  environment.   With interfaces to over 50 EDA vendors, this product
allows  users  to select tools with which they are most familiar and therefore
shortens their design cycle.

The  Company  is  preparing  a  third  software solution series to be directed
towards high-end system level design applications which have historically been
dominated by gate arrays.  Xilinx will provide pre-implemented, fully-verified
"drop-in  modules", called LogiCores, for commonly used complex functions such
as  digital  signal  processing.    These  cores  of intellectual property are
expected  to change the way in which logic has been historically designed.  As
a result, users should be able to shorten development time, reduce design risk
and obtain superior performance for their designs.

Xilinx's  XACTstep  development  system  software operates on desktop computer
platforms,  including  personal  computers  and  workstations  from  IBM,
IBM-compatible manufacturers, HP, DEC and Sun Microsystems.  Through March 30,
1996, the Company had distributed over 26,700 development systems to more than
5,000 system manufacturers worldwide.

In fiscal 1996, sales of FPGAs, CPLDs, EPROMS, Hardwire and development system
software  products  accounted  for  85%,  2%, 5%, 5% and 3% of total revenues,
respectively.    For  additional  information  on  the Company's revenues, see
Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial
Condition in Item 7.

 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Xilinx's  research  and  development activities are primarily directed towards
the  design  of  new integrated circuits, the design of new development system
software  and ongoing cost reductions and performance improvements in existing
products.   The Company's recent research and product development efforts have
been  directed  principally  towards  its  XC3100,  XC4000, XC5000, XC6000 and
XC8100  families of FPGAs, CPLD products, XACT development system software and
towards other proprietary new architectures and processes.

Xilinx  believes  that  development  system software is an important factor in
expanding  the use of programmable logic devices.  The Company's R&D challenge
is  to  continue  to  develop new products that create solutions for customers
while  simultaneously  reducing  product development time. A further challenge
will  be  the  completion  of  integrating  NeoCAD's  advanced  FPGA  software
technology  into  the  existing  product line. The Company presently allocates
approximately 60% and 40% of its research and development staff for integrated
circuit  design  or  process  development  and  development  system  software
products,  respectively.   As of March 30, 1996, 388 employees were engaged in
research  and  development.  In  fiscal  1996,  1995,  and 1994, the Company's
research and development expenses were $64.6 million, $45.3 million, and $34.3
million,  respectively.    The  Company expects that it will continue to spend
substantial funds on research and development.

Research  and  development  expenses, while having increased in amount in each
period  presented,  have  approximated 12% of revenues in 1996 and 13% in 1995
and  1994.  The Company believes that technical leadership is essential to its
success  and  is  committed  to continuing a significant level of research and
development effort.

 MARKETING AND SALES

Xilinx  sells  its  products  through several channels of distribution: direct
sales  to  manufacturers  by  independent  sales  representative  firms, sales
through domestic distributors, and sales through foreign distributors.  Xilinx
also  utilizes  a  direct sales management organization and field applications
engineers (FAEs) as well as manufacturer's representatives and distributors to
reach  a  broad  base  of  potential  customers.    The  Company's independent
representatives  address larger OEM customers and act as a direct sales force,
while  distributors  serve  the  balance  of the Company's customer base.  All
channels are supported by Xilinx sales and technical support personnel.

In  North  America,  Hamilton-Hallmark,  Marshall  Industries,  and  Insight
Electronics,  Inc.  distribute  the  Company's  products  nationwide,  and  Nu
Horizons Electronics provides additional regional sales coverage.  The Company
believes  that  distributors  provide a cost effective means of reaching small
and  medium-sized  customers.   Since the Company's programmable logic devices
are  standard  products,  they  do  not present many of the inventory risks to
distributors  of  custom  gate  arrays, and they simplify the requirements for
distributor technical support.

Because  of  the  uncertainty  associated  with future pricing adjustments and
product  returns,  the Company defers recognition of revenues and related cost
of  revenues  for  products  sold  through  domestic  distributors  until  the
merchandise is sold by the distributors.


BACKLOG AND CUSTOMERS

As  of March 30, 1996, the Company's backlog was approximately $143.8 million,
as  compared  to  approximately  $94.9  million  as  of April 1, 1995.  Xilinx
includes  in its backlog all purchase orders scheduled for delivery within the
next  six  months.    Xilinx produces standard products which can generally be
shipped  from  inventory  within  a short time after receipt of an order.  The
Company's  business,  and  to  a  large  and growing extent that of the entire
semiconductor  industry,  is  characterized  by  short-term order and shipment
schedules.    Orders constituting the Company's current backlog are subject to
changes in delivery schedule or to cancellation at the option of the purchaser
without  significant  penalty.    Accordingly,  although useful for scheduling
production, backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable measure of
revenues for any future period.

In  fiscal 1996, the Company shipped products to over 5,000 customers directly
or  through  domestic  and  foreign  distributors.    No  single  end customer
accounted for more than 6% of revenues in fiscal 1996 or 1995 and 4% in fiscal
1994.   See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for
Industry and Geographic Information.

 WAFER FABRICATION

The majority of wafers for FPGAs shipped by the Company have been manufactured
by Seiko Epson Corporation (Seiko) and Yamaha Corporation (Yamaha).  Seiko has
non-exclusive,  non-transferable rights to manufacture and sell FPGAs designed
by  Xilinx  in Japan and Europe but is not currently exercising these rights. 
In  exchange,  Seiko  has  provided  the  Company with access to advanced CMOS
processes.    Precise  terms  with  respect  to the volume and timing of wafer
production  and  the  pricing  of  wafers  produced  by  Seiko  and Yamaha are
determined  by  periodic  negotiations  between  the Company and these foundry
partners.    From  time  to  time, Xilinx may contract with other suppliers to
provide wafers for the Company's products.

Xilinx's  strategy  is  to  focus  its  resources  on  creating new integrated
circuits and development system software and on market development rather than
on  wafer  fabrication.    The Company continuously evaluates opportunities to
enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity.  As a result,
the  Company  has  entered into recent agreements with United Microelectronics
Corporation and Seiko as discussed below.

The  Company  entered into a series of agreements with United Microelectronics
Corporation  (UMC)  pursuant  to  which the Company has agreed to join UMC and
other parties to form a joint venture for the purpose of building and managing
an  advanced  semiconductor  manufacturing  facility  in Taiwan. See Note 4 of
Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  Under the terms of the
agreement,  the Company invested $34 million in fiscal 1996 and will invest an
additional  $68  million  and  $34  million  in  December  1996 and July 1997,
respectively,  for  a  25%  equity interest in the venture. As a result of its
equity ownership, the Company will receive rights to purchase at market prices
a  percentage  of  the facility 's wafer production.  The proposed facility is
expected to commence limited production of eight-inch sub-micron wafers during
fiscal 1998.  The Company is currently receiving eight-inch, sub-micron wafers
in  limited  volume  from  a  recently constructed foundry in which UMC is the
major  shareholder.  Xilinx believes it will continue to receive such products
in moderate volumes until the joint venture facility is operational.

On  May  17,  1996, the Company signed an agreement with Seiko.  The agreement
provides  for  an  advance  to  Seiko  of  $200  million  to  be  used  in the
construction  of  a  wafer  fabrication  facility  in Japan which will provide
access  to  eight-inch  sub-micron wafers.  In conjunction with the agreement,
$30  million  was  paid  in  May  1996  and further installments are scheduled
starting  in  November 1996.  Repayment of this advance will be in the form of
wafer  deliveries expected to begin in the first half of 1998.  In addition to
the advance payments, the Company will provide further funding to Seiko in the
amount  of $100 million.  This additional funding will be paid after the final
installment  of  the  $200  million  advance,  and  the form of the additional
funding will be negotiated at that time.

ASSEMBLY AND TEST

Wafers  purchased  by  the  Company  are  tested by the manufacturer or by the
Company.    Tested  wafers  are  assembled by a subcontractor in facilities in
various  Pacific  Rim  countries.    In  the  assembly process, the wafers are
separated  into  individual  integrated  circuits  which are then assembled in
packages.    Following  assembly,  the  packaged  units  are  returned  to the
Company's  U.S.  or  Ireland facilities for further testing, marking and final
inspection prior to shipment to customers.

 PATENTS AND LICENSES

Through  March  30,  1996,  the  Company held 92 United States patents and has
filed for an additional 139 United States patents in the areas of software, IC
architecture  and  design.    The  Company  intends  to vigorously protect its
intellectual  property.    The  Company  believes  that failure to enforce its
patents  or  to  effectively  protect  its trade secrets could have an adverse
effect  on the Company's business. See Legal Proceedings in Item 3 and Note 10
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Xilinx has acquired various software licenses that permit the Company to grant
object  code  sublicenses  to  its  customers for certain third party software
programs licensed with the Company's development system software. In addition,
the Company has licensed certain software for internal use in product design.

EMPLOYEES

Xilinx's  employee  population  has  grown by 38% during the past year.  As of
March  30,  1996, Xilinx had 1,201 employees compared to 868 at the end of the
prior year.  None of the Company's employees are represented by a labor union.
  The  Company  has  not  experienced  any  work  stoppages  and considers its
relations with its employees to be good.

COMPETITION

The  Company's  FPGA  and  CPLD  products  compete  in  the programmable logic
marketplace,  with  a  substantial  majority of the Company's revenues derived
from  its  FPGA product families. The industries in which the Company competes
are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change,
rapid  product  obsolescence  and  price  erosion.    The  Company  expects
significantly  increased competition both from existing competitors and from a
number of companies that may enter its market.  Xilinx believes that important
competitive  factors  in  the programmable logic market include price, product
performance  and  reliability,  adaptability  of  products  to  specific
applications,  ease  of  use and functionality of development system software,
and  technical  service and support.  The Company 's strategy for expansion in
the programmable logic market includes continued price reductions commensurate
with  the  ability to lower the cost of manufacture and continued introduction
of  new product architectures which target high volume, low cost applications.
However,  there  can  be  no assurances that the Company will be successful in
achieving this strategy.

The  Company's  major sources of competition are comprised of three elements: 
the  manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers of high density
programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures and other
providers  of  programmable  logic products.  The Company competes with custom
gate  array  manufacturers  on  the  basis  of  lower  design  costs,  shorter
development  schedules and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of
custom  gate  arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in
high  volumes.    However, the Company believes that the design specifications
for  many  customers  can  be  met  by  the  density and speed capabilities of
Xilinx's  programmable  logic  products  which are cost effective over a broad
range of production volumes.  In addition, the Company 's efforts to introduce
lower cost architectures are intended to narrow the gap between current custom
gate  array  production costs (in high volumes) and FPGA production costs.  To
the  extent that such efforts are not successful, the Company's business could
be materially adversely affected.

The  Company  competes  with  providers  of  high  density  programmable logic
products  characterized  by  FPGA-type  architectures on the basis of software
capability,  product  functionally,  price, performance and customer service. 
The  Company  believes  that  certain  of its patents have been infringed by a
competitor  and  has  initiated  legal  action  to  protect  its  intellectual
property.    See  Legal  Proceedings  in  Item  3  and  Note  10  of  Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

The  benefits  of  programmable  logic have attracted a number of companies to
this  market,  competing  primarily  on  the basis of speed, density or cost. 
Xilinx  recognizes  that different applications require different programmable
technologies,  and the Company is developing multiple architectures, processes
and products to meet these varying customer needs.  Recognizing the increasing
importance of standard software solutions, Xilinx is working to develop common
design  software that supports the full range of integrated circuit products. 
Xilinx  believes  that  automation  and  ease  of  design  will be significant
competitive factors in the programmable logic market.

Although  certain  manufacturers  of  PLDs  compete  with  Xilinx, significant
differences  in  logic  density  between most complex PLDs and FPGAs limit the
amount  of  competitive overlap.  While the architecture of complex PLDs gives
them  a  performance advantage in certain instances, the Company believes that
the  higher  density  available with FPGAs makes them more economical for many
designs.

Several  companies, both large and small, have introduced products competitive
with  those  of  the  Company  or have announced their intention to enter this
market.    Some of the Company's competitors may possess innovative technology
which  could  prove  superior to Xilinx's technology in some applications.  In
addition,  the  Company  anticipates  potential  competition from suppliers of
logic  products  based  on new technologies.  Many of the Company's current or
potential  competitors  have  substantially  greater financial, manufacturing,
marketing  and  technical  resources  than Xilinx. This additional competition
could adversely affect the Company.

Xilinx  also  faces  competition from its licensees.  Under a license from the
Company,  AT&T  is  manufacturing  and marketing the Company's non-proprietary
XC3000  FPGA  products  and is employing that technology to provide additional
FPGA  products  offering  high  density.   Seiko has rights to manufacture the
Company's  products  and  market them in Japan and Europe but is not currently
doing  so.    AMD  is  licensed  to  use  certain  of the Company's patents to
manufacture  and  market products other than SRAM-based FPGAs and, after March
19, 1997, could also compete directly in this market.

</TABLE>



Except  as  set forth below, each of the Company's executive officers has been
engaged  in  his  principal  occupation  described  above during the past five
years.    There  is  no  family relationship between any director or executive
officer of the Company.

Willem  P.  "Wim"  Roelandts  joined  the  Company  in  January  1996 as Chief
Executive  Officer.  He is a 28-year veteran of Hewlett-Packard Company, where
he  most  recently served as a senior vice president and managed the company's
Computer  Systems  Organization  from  November 1992 through January 1996.  In
this  capacity,  he  was  responsible  for all aspects of the computer systems
business  worldwide,  including  research  and  development,  manufacturing,
marketing,  professional  services and sales. He also served as vice president
and  general  manager  of  the  Network  Systems  Group  from December 1990 to
November 1992.

Robert  C.  Hinckley  joined  the  Company in November 1991 as Vice President,
Strategic Plans and Programs, serves as the Company's General Counsel, and was
appointed  Secretary in May 1993.  He acted as interim Chief Operating Officer
from  March  1994 until August 1994.  From August 1990 to November 1991 he was
engaged in the private practice of law.  From January 1989 until  August 1990,
he  served  as  Senior  Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and
Treasurer of Spectra Physics, Inc.

In  April  1996,  Curtis  S.  Wozniak,  President and Chief Operating Officer,
resigned from the Company.  He had joined Xilinx in August 1994.

ITEM 2.     PROPERTIES

Xilinx's  principal administrative, sales, marketing, research and development
and  final testing facility is located in adjacent buildings providing 335,000
square  feet of available space in San Jose, California and are leased through
1999.    The  Company  has  entered  into  lease  agreements relating to these
facilities  which  would  allow the Company to purchase these facilities on or
before  the lease expiration dates in December 1999.  In addition, the Company
maintains  domestic  sales  offices  in  nineteen  locations which include the
metropolitan  areas  of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Dallas, Los Angeles,
Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Raleigh and San Jose as well as international sales
offices located in the metropolitan areas of London, Munich, Paris, Stockholm,
Tokyo,  Taipei, Seoul and Hong Kong.   The Company completed construction of a
100,000 square foot administrative, research and development and final testing
facility  in  the metropolitan area of Dublin, Ireland in 1995.  This facility
is being used to service the Company's customer base outside of North America.
  The  Company  is  currently  constructing  a  60,000 square foot facility in
Boulder,  Colorado.  This facility will replace the former NeoCAD facility and
will  be  the primary location for the Company's software efforts in the areas
of research and development, manufacturing and quality control.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in
the  United States  District Court for the Northern District of California for
infringement  of certain of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera filed
suit  against  the  Company,  alleging  that certain of the Company's products
infringe  certain  Altera  patents.  Fact discovery has been completed in both
cases.   No trial date has been set.  The Court has stayed further proceedings
in  both cases until August 30, 1996, when the next status conference with the
Court  is  scheduled.    On  April  20,  1995, Altera filed an additional suit
against the Company in Federal District Court in Delaware  (the Delaware suit)
alleging  that the Company's XC5000 family infringes a certain Altera patent. 
The  Company  answered  the  Delaware  suit  denying  that  the  XC5000 family
infringes  the  patent  in  suit,  which  is  the  subject  of the litigation,
asserting certain affirmative defenses and counterclaiming that the Altera Max
9000 family infringes certain of the Company's patents.  The Delaware suit has
now  been  transferred  to  the  United States District Court for the Northern
District  of  California.   Due to the uncertain nature of the litigation with
Altera and because the lawsuits are still in the pre-trial stage, the ultimate
outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined  at this time.  Management
believes that it has meritorious defenses to such claims and is defending them
vigorously.   The foregoing is a forward looking statement  and actual results
could differ materially.

There are no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company  is  a  party  or  of  which  any of its property is the subject.  The
Company  knows  of  no  legal  proceedings  contemplated  by  any governmental
authority or agency.

ITEM 4.     SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

No  matters  were  submitted  to  a vote of security holders during the fourth
quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.

ITEM 5.     MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND
                          RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

Xilinx's Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol
XLNX.    The  table  below reflects for the periods indicated the high and low
closing  sales prices per share of the Common Stock, as reported on the Nasdaq
National  Market.    Xilinx has never paid a cash dividend on its Common Stock
and  intends  to continue this policy for the foreseeable future.  As of March
31,  1996,  there  were  approximately 671 shareholders of record.  Since many
holders'  shares  are  listed  under  their brokerage firms' names, the actual
number of shareholders is estimated by the Company to be over 35,000.

ITEM 7.     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
                     CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     Cautionary Statement

The  statements  in this Management's Discussion and Analysis that are forward
looking  involve  numerous  risks  and  uncertainties and are based on current
expectations.    Actual  results  may  differ  materially.    Such  risks  and
uncertainties  are  detailed in the Company's SEC reports and filings. Certain
of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under "Factors Affecting Future
Results".



Nature of Operations

Xilinx,  Inc.  ("Xilinx"  or the "Company") designs, develops and markets CMOS
(complementary  metal-oxide-silicon)  programmable  logic  devices and related
development  system  software.  The Company's programmable logic product lines
include  field  programmable  gate  arrays  ("FPGAs") and complex programmable

     Revenue

Xilinx  reported  record revenues for 1996 of  $560.8 million, representing an
increase  of 57.9% from $355.1 million for 1995 and 118.7% from $256.4 million
reported  for  1994.  The  growth in revenues was a function of increased unit
sales  of  programmable  logic  devices  and, more specifically, was primarily
attributable  to the revenue growth of the XC4000 family as well as the growth
of  the  Company's new product, the XC5000 family. Other contributors included
the Company 's XC3000, XC3100 and CPLD families.

Xilinx's  development system software is used by the Company 's customers to
implement  designs  in  the  Company  's  programmable logic devices. Software
revenues increased by 36.1% in 1996 to approximately $17.1 million as compared
to $12.6 million in 1995 and $11.6 million in 1994. Although software revenues
have increased in dollar amounts, sales have declined as a percentage of total
revenues,  accounting  for  3%, 4% and 5% of revenues for 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively.  Cumulative licenses for proprietary development system software
distributed to customers through the end of 1996 approximated 26,700 units, as
compared to 21,000 and 16,500 at the end of 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Revenue  contribution  by product line reflected increased customer demand for
the functionality and performance provided by the Company's higher density and
higher  speed  programmable  logic  devices.  Of  the $205.7 million growth in
revenues  between  1995  and  1996,  96%  was  provided  by  revenues from the
proprietary  products  within the XC3000 family as well as the XC3100, XC4000,
XC5000 and CPLD families, all of which are proprietary products. Revenues from
proprietary  products  increased from 74% of the aggregate revenues in 1995 to
85% in 1996. In the fourth quarter of 1996, proprietary products accounted for
88%  of  total  revenues  as  compared to 79% for the comparable 1995 quarter.
Revenues  from  the XC4000 family increased 106% between 1995 and 1996 to $250
million.  Deriving  revenues  from proprietary products has been emphasized by
the  Company  as  an  effective implementation of a corporate pricing strategy
whose  aim  is  to expand the market for its products by reducing sales prices
coincident  with and commensurate with reductions in the cost of manufacturing
these  products. The Company is actively pursuing a strategy of broadening the
markets  it  serves through the enhancement of software development tools, the
introduction of architectures offering new functionality, and the reduction of
IC  prices  through  continuous  advancements  in  the  silicon  manufacturing
process.

During  1996,  all  product families except the non-proprietary members of the
XC3000  family,  where  there  is  a  second  source  competitor,  experienced
increases  in unit volume. During this period, the average selling price of an
IC  product  family  fell  between  8% and 24%. Individual products within the
XC3000,  XC3100 and XC4000 families experienced price decreases as much as 32%
during  the  past  year,  as  prices were reduced in the higher complexity and
higher  speed  families  in  order  to  be  more  competitive  in  high volume
applications.  Price  erosion  of  this  magnitude  has  been  common  in  the
semiconductor  industry,  as  advances  in both architecture and manufacturing
process  technology  have  permitted  continual  reductions  in  cost.  The
approximately  70%  increase in unit volume for the XC3100 family and the more
than  doubling  in  unit volume for the XC4000 family outweighed the impact of
price  erosion  on  individual  product lines, as the weighted average selling
price  for all ICs increased approximately 4% in 1996 relative to the previous
year.

The  XC4000  products  provide  the  widest  range of densities of any family,
currently ranging from 2,000 to 28,000 gates. The Company 's HardWire products
offer a low cost migration path for high volume applications. During 1996, the
Company  began  volume  production  of the XC5000 family, which represents the
first  FPGA specifically developed as a cost effective, high volume production
alternative to gate arrays. The XC5000 family is expected to allow the Company
to  enter  new  market  segments,  for  which most new designs are expected to
require higher quantities. However, there can be no assurances that the XC5000
family  will  be  successful in entering new market segments. Revenues for the
XC5000  family  were  $9.1  million  for  1996. In the second half of 1996 the
Company  introduced  the XC9500 CPLD family, which provides complete in-system
programming  and  test  capabilities  for  users  who  need  maximum  design
flexibility throughout their product life cycle.

No  single end customer accounted for more than 6% of revenues in 1996 or 1995
and 4% of revenues in 1994.

International  revenues  constituted  35%,  31%  and 28% of total revenues for
1996,  1995  and  1994,  respectively.  International  revenues continue to be
primarily  to customers in Europe and Japan. Revenue growth over the past year
in  these  two  international markets was 73% and 111%, respectively. In 1996,
the  Company  completed construction of a $32.3 million manufacturing facility
in  Dublin,  Ireland.  The  Ireland  facility  has increased production levels
throughout  1996  and has enhanced the Company 's ability to meet the needs of
its  international customers. The Company believes that international revenues
will  continue  to  grow  at  a  faster rate over the intermediate future than
domestic sales and projects that such revenues will eventually comprise 50% of
the  worldwide  total.  However, there can be no assurances that international
revenues will eventually reach this level in the future. Sales to Pacific Rim,
Middle  East  and  other  regions  outside  North  America,  Europe  and Japan
represented approximately 4% of revenues in each year presented.

Recently,  several  independent semiconductor industry analysts have indicated
their  belief that the overall semiconductor industry will grow at lower rates
than actual growth rates over the last few years. See "Other Factors Affecting
Operating  Results"  for  discussion  relating  to  potential  impact  of
semiconductor industry conditions on the Company's business.

The  Company  expects  its  growth rate in revenue for fiscal 1997 to decrease
from  the  levels  experienced  in fiscal 1996.  The Company believes that the
conditions that led to slow growth in the last two quarters of fiscal 1996 are
still present, although probably to a lesser degree. The Company also realizes
that  a  prolonged  slowdown  in  the  overall  semiconductor  industry  would
detrimentally  impact  Xilinx.  While  the  Company currently projects revenue
growth  rates for the first two quarters of fiscal 1997 to be comparable to or
above  the  two  to four percent quarterly growth experienced in the final two
quarters of the prior fiscal year, no assurance can be given that this will be
the case.

The  preceding  three  paragraphs  contains  forward-looking  statements which
involve  risks  and  uncertainties.  The Company's actual results could differ
materially  from  those  anticipated  in these forward-looking statements as a
result  of  certain  factors  including  those set forth in "Factors Affecting
Future Results" and elsewhere in this section.

     Gross Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of revenues was 63.8% for 1996 as compared to 61%
for  1995 and 61.5% for 1994. Recent gross margin improvements are largely due
to  the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  versus  the  yen,  recurring  pricing
negotiations,  improved  product  yields  associated with recent manufacturing
technology enhancements, and realization of the benefits of expanded levels of
production.  Over  the  past  three years, Xilinx has also been able to offset
much  of the erosion in gross margin percentages on the more mature integrated
circuits with increased volumes of newer, proprietary, higher margin products.
  The  Company  recognizes  that  ongoing  price reductions for its integrated
circuits  are  a significant element in expanding the market for its products.
Company  management  believes  that the fiscal 1996 gross margins of 63.8% are
neither  sustainable  nor desirable in the future. Gross margins closer to the
Company's  historical  range  of  60%  to  62% of revenues are considered more
appropriate  for  expanding  market  share while realizing acceptable returns,
although  there  can be no assurance that future gross margins will be in this
range.  Because  the Company 's wafer purchases supplied by Japanese foundries
are  denominated  in yen, a strengthened U.S. dollar exchange rate against the
yen  has  had  a  positive impact on manufacturing costs.  Manufacturing costs
would  be  adversely  impacted  if  the  dollar  weakens against the yen. "See
Factors Affecting Future Results."

     Research and Development

The  Company  has increased the dollars spent on research and development each
year  in its twelve year history. These expenses in 1996 exceeded those of the
prior  year  by  43%  and  those  of 1994 by 88%. The increase in research and
development  expenses  is primarily attributable to increased staffing, higher
engineering  wafer  purchases,  and  increased  facility  and  support  costs
associated  with an expanded scope of operations. Increased staffing in fiscal
1996  was  attributable  in part to the acquisition and integration of NeoCAD.
See  Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company remains
committed  to  a significant level of research and development effort in order
to  continue  to  compete  aggressively in the programmable logic marketplace.
Through  March  31, 1996, the Company had 92 U.S. patents issued and has filed
for  an  additional 139 U.S. patents in the areas of software, IC architecture
and  design.  As  of  March  31, 1996, research and development personnel were
split  40%  for software development and 60% for integrated circuit design and
process  development.  Xilinx  has not capitalized any of the costs associated
with its software development.

     Marketing, General and Administrative

Marketing, general and administrative costs have increased in each of the past
three  years  but  declined  as  a percentage of revenues, reflecting both the
greater  growth  rate  in  revenues  and  the  Company's commitment to control
administrative  expenses.  Sales  expenses  have  increased  each  year due to
increasing  personnel,  increases  in  advertising,  the  costs  of  new sales
offices,  and greater commission expenses associated with higher revenues. The
Company  has  nineteen  sales  offices  located  throughout the United States,
including  the  metropolitan  areas  of San Jose, Los Angeles, Denver, Dallas,
Chicago,  Minneapolis,  Atlanta,  Raleigh,  Philadelphia and Boston as well as
eight international sales offices located in the metropolitan areas of London,
Munich,  Paris, Stockholm, Tokyo, Taipei, Seoul and Hong Kong. The increase in
general and administrative expenses since 1994 is primarily attributable to an
expanded  number of employees and to continuing legal expenses associated with
litigation  intended  to  protect the Company 's intellectual property rights.
The  timing  and  extent  of  future  legal  costs associated with the ongoing
enforcement  of  the  Company's  intellectual  property rights are not readily
predictable  and  may  increase the level of future general and administrative
expenses.

     Non-recurring Charges

During  the first quarter of fiscal 1996, the Company incurred a $19.4 million
non-recurring  write-off  of  in-process technology relating to the Company 's
acquisition  of  NeoCAD.    During 1996, the Company has incurred research and
development  expenses relating to its efforts to combine the Xilinx and NeoCAD
technologies  into  an  integrated  software  product.  See Note 3 of Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  During 1995, the Company incurred a $2.5
million write-off of a minority investment in Star Semiconductor Corporation.

     Operating Income

Operating income grew from $65.2 million in 1994 to $92 million in 1995 and to
$165.8  million  in  1996.  Operating income in 1996 was $185.1 million before
consideration  of  the  non-recurring write-off of in-process technology. Over
the  past  three  years,  operating income as a percentage of revenues (before
consideration  of  non-recurring  charges) has increased from 25.4% in 1994 to
26.6% in 1995 and to 33% in 1996. Operating income as a percentage of revenues
could be adversely impacted in future years by the factors noted above, and as
the  Company  expands its efforts in research and development and continues to
assert its intellectual property rights.

     Interest, Net

The  Company incurs interest expense on the $250 million of 5 1/4% convertible
subordinated  notes issued in November 1995. The Company earns interest income
on  its  cash,  cash  equivalents,  short-term  investments  and  restricted
investments.    The  amount of interest earned is a function of the balance of
cash  invested  as  well as the prevailing interest rates. Net interest income
for  1996 increased by $2.3 million over 1995. In 1996, the increased interest
expense  incurred  relating  to the notes was partially offset by the interest
income  earned  from  investing  the net proceeds of such notes. The Company's
investment portfolio contains tax-advantaged municipal bonds which have pretax
yields  which  are  less  than  the  interest rate on the notes. For financial
reporting purposes, the Company effectively records the difference between the
pretax  and  tax-equivalent  yields  as  a reduction in provision for taxes on
income.  As  a  result  of  the  difference  in  yields and future uses of the
investment  portfolio, levels of net interest income are likely to decrease in
the future.

     Provision for Income Taxes

Xilinx 's effective tax rate was 40.6% for 1996 as compared to 37.5% and 38.8%
for  1995 and 1994, respectively. The higher tax rate for fiscal 1996 resulted
from  the  non-recurring  write-off  of  in-process technology relating to the
acquisition  of  NeoCAD,  which  is  not  tax  deductible.    Excluding  the
non-recurring write-off of in-process technology, the Company 's effective tax
rate  for  fiscal  1996  was 36.5%.  The reduced rate from the previous fiscal
year is primarily due to the Company 's expanded operations in certain foreign
jurisdictions  that  offer  statutory  tax  rates beneath the US effective tax
rate.  The  Company believes that net deferred tax assets (approximately $25.1
million  at  March 31, 1996) are realizable due to the taxable income existing
in potential carryback years.

     Inflation

The  effects  of  inflation upon the Company's financial results have not been
significant.

FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS

     Dependence Upon Independent Manufacturers

The  Company  does  not manufacture the wafers used for its products. To date,
most  of  the  Company  's  FPGA  wafers have been manufactured by Seiko Epson
Corporation  (Seiko)  and  Yamaha  Corporation.  The Company has depended upon
these  suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive performance and
cost attributes, to produce wafers at acceptable yields and to deliver them to
the  Company  in  a  timely manner. While the quality, yield and timeliness of
wafer deliveries to date from its suppliers have been acceptable, there can be
no  assurance  that  manufacturing  problems will not occur in the future. Any
prolonged  inability  to  obtain  wafers with competitive performance and cost
attributes,  adequate yields or timely deliveries from these manufacturers, or
any  other  circumstance  that  would  require the Company to seek alternative
sources of supply, could delay shipments. Any significant delays could have an
adverse effect on the Company 's operating results.

The  Company  's  long-term growth will depend in large part on the Company 's
ability  to  obtain  increased  wafer  fabrication  capacity from suppliers. A
significant  increase in general industry demand or any interruption of supply
could  reduce  the Company 's supply of wafers or increase the Company 's cost
of  such  wafers,  thereby  materially  adversely  affecting  the  Company  's
business.

In  order  to  secure additional wafer capacity, the Company from time to time
considers  a  number  of  alternatives,  including, without limitation, equity
investments  in,  or  loans,  deposits,  or  other  financial  commitments to,
independent  wafer  manufacturers  in exchange for production capacity, or the
use  of contracts which commit the Company to purchase specified quantities of
wafers  over  extended periods.  The Company has at times been unable, and may
in  the  future  be  unable,  to  fully  satisfy  customer  demand  because of
production  constraints, including the ability of suppliers and subcontractors
to  provide  materials and services in a timely manner, as well as the ability
of the Company to process products for shipment.  The Company 's future growth
will  depend in part on its ability to locate and qualify additional suppliers
and  subcontractors  and  to  increase  its own capacity to ship products, and
there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  Company  will be able to do so.  Any
increase  in  these  constraints on the Company 's production could materially
adversely  affect  the  Company  's  business. In this regard, the Company has
entered  into  a  joint venture, United Silicon Inc. (USI), to construct a new
wafer  fabrication  facility.    See  Notes  4  and 5 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements  and  the  Commitments  discussion  within  "Financial
Condition,  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources." However, there are many risks
associated  with  the  construction  of  a  new  facility, and there can be no
assurance  that  such facility will become operational in a timely manner.  In
addition,  the  Company  has recently entered into an agreement for additional
capacity  with  another  foundry.    See  Note    11  of Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements  and  the  Commitments  discussion  within  "Financial
Condition,  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources."    If  the  Company  requires
additional  capacity  and  such  capacity  is  unavailable,  or unavailable on
reasonable  terms,  the  Company  's  business  could  be materially adversely
affected.

     Impact of Currency

The  Company  has  historically purchased most of the processed silicon wafers
used  in  its  integrated  circuits  from  Japanese foundries, which have been
denominated in yen. The Company has often limited its exposure to fluctuations
in  foreign exchange rates through the purchase of forward exchange and option
contracts  and  by  denominating  billings  to  Japanese customers in yen. The
Company  has entered into currency option contracts to cover approximately 50%
of  1997  yen  requirements for wafer purchases after consideration of foreign
sales  denominated in yen. Weakness in the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar
could  increase  the  effective cost of processed silicon and adversely affect
the  Company 's future results of operations. Foreign sales are billed in U.S.
dollars  except  for  sales  in Japan denominated in yen. The Company has also
entered  into  foreign  exchange  forward contracts to eliminate the impact of
future  exchange  fluctuations  on  the US dollar cost of investing in the USI
joint venture.

     Litigation

The Company is currently involved in patent litigation with Altera Corporation
(see  Note  10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 3, Legal
Proceedings).    Due to the uncertain nature of the litigation with Altera and
because the lawsuits are still in the pre-trial stage, the ultimate outcome of
these  matters cannot be determined at this time.  Management believes that it
has meritorious defenses to such claims and is defending them vigorously.  The
foregoing is a forward looking statement and the future outcome could differ.

     Other Factors Affecting Operating Results

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical  market patterns. The Company 's
results  of  operations  are  affected by a wide variety of factors, including
general  economic  conditions  and  conditions  specific  to the semiconductor
industry,  decreases  in average selling price over the life of any particular
product,  the timing of new product introductions (both by the Company and its
competitors), the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies, the
ability  to  safeguard patents and intellectual property in a rapidly evolving
market,  and  rapid  escalation  of  demand  for  some products in the face of
equally  steep  decline in demand for others. Market demand for the Company 's
products, particularly for those most recently introduced, can be difficult to
predict,  especially  in  light of customers ' demands to shorten product lead
time.  This  could  lead  to  revenue volatility if the Company were unable to
provide  sufficient  quantities  of  specified products in a given quarter. In
addition,  any  difficulty in achieving targeted yields could adversely impact
the  Company  's results of operations. The Company attempts to identify these
changes  in  market  conditions  as soon as possible; however, the rapidity of
their  onset makes prediction of and reaction to such events difficult. Due to
the  foregoing  and  other  factors,  past  results  are  a much less reliable
predictor  of  the future than is the case in many older, more stable and less
dynamic industries.

The  Company 's future success depends on its ability to develop and introduce
on a timely basis new products which compete effectively on the basis of price
and  performance  and  which address customer requirements. The success of new
product  introductions  is  dependent  upon  several factors, including timely
completion of new product designs, achievement of acceptable yields and market
acceptance.  No assurance can be given that the Company 's product development
efforts  will  be  successful  or  that  its  new products will achieve market
acceptance.  In addition, the average selling price for any particular product
tends  to decrease rapidly over the product 's life. To offset such decreases,
the Company relies primarily on obtaining yield improvements and corresponding
cost reductions in the manufacture of existing products and on introducing new
products  which  incorporate  advanced  features  and  other price/performance
factors  such  that  higher  average  selling  prices  and  higher margins are
achievable  relative  to  mature  product  lines. To the extent that such cost
reductions and new product introductions with higher margins do not occur in a
timely manner or the Company 's products do not achieve market acceptance, the
Company 's operating results could be adversely affected.

The  Company's  FPGA  and  CPLD  products  compete  in  the programmable logic
marketplace,  with  a  substantial  majority of the Company's revenues derived
from  its FPGA product families.  The industries in which the Company competes
are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change,
rapid  product  obsolescence  and  price  erosion.    The  Company  expects
significantly  increased competition both from existing competitors and from a
number of companies that may enter its market.  Xilinx believes that important
competitive  factors  in  the programmable logic market include price, product
performance  and  reliability,  adaptability  of  products  to  specific
applications,  ease  of  use and functionality of development system software,
and  technical  service  and support.  The Company's strategy for expansion in
the programmable logic market includes continued price reductions commensurate
with  the  ability to lower the cost of manufacture and continued introduction
of new product architectures which target high volume, low cost applications. 
The  Company's  major  sources of competition are comprised of three elements:
the  manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays,  providers of high density
programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures and other
providers  of  programmable  logic products.  The Company competes with custom
gate  array  manufacturers  on  the  basis  of  lower  design  costs,  shorter
development  schedules and reduced inventory risks.  The primary attributes of
custom  gate  arrays  are high density, high speed and low production costs in
high  volumes.    However, the Company believes that the design specifications
for  many  customers  can  be  met  by  the  density and speed capabilities of
Xilinx's  programmable logic products which are cost effective in the required
production  volumes.    In  addition, the Company's efforts to introduce lower
cost  architectures are intended to narrow the gap between current custom gate
array  production  costs  (in high volumes) and FPGA production costs.  To the
extent  that  such efforts are not successful, the Company's business could be
materially adversely affected.

The  Company  relies upon patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to
protect  its  intellectual  property.  There  can  be  no  assurance that such
intellectual  property  rights  can  be successfully asserted in the future or
will  not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. From time to time, third
parties,  including  competitors  of the Company, may assert exclusive patent,
copyright  and  other  intellectual  property  rights to technologies that are
important  to the Company. Litigation, regardless of its outcome, could result
in  substantial  cost  and  diversion  of  resources  of  the  Company.  Any
infringement  claim  or  other  litigation  against  or  by  the Company could
materially, adversely affect the Company 's financial condition and results of
operations.

The Company's future success depends in large part on the continued service of
its  key  technical,  marketing and management personnel and on its ability to
continue  to attract and retain qualified employees, particularly those highly
skilled  design,  process  and  test  engineers involved in the manufacture of
existing  products  and  the  development  of new products and processes.  The
competition for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key employees could
have  a  material,  adverse  effect  on  the Company's financial condition and
results of operations.

Sales outside of the United States carry a number of inherent risks, including
risks of currency exchange fluctuations, the need for export licenses, tariffs
and  other  potential  trade  barriers,  reduced  protection  for intellectual
property  rights in some countries, the impact of recessionary environments in
economies outside the United States and generally longer receivable collection
periods.   The Company's business is also subject to the risks associated with
the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export
of semiconductor products.  The Company cannot predict whether quotas, duties,
taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed by the United States or
other  countries upon the importation or exportation of the Company's products
in the future or what, if any, effect such actions would have on the Company's
financial condition and results of operations.

In  order  to expand international sales and service, the Company will need to
maintain  and  expand  existing  foreign  operations  or establish new foreign
operations.    This  entails  hiring  additional  personnel and maintaining or
expanding  existing  relationships  with  international distributors and sales
representatives.    This  will  require  significant  management attention and
financial  resources  and  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's results of
operations.   There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
its  maintenance  or  expansion  of  existing  foreign  operations,  in  its
establishment  of  new  foreign  operations  or  in its efforts to maintain or
expand  its  relationships  with  international  distributors  or  sales
representatives.

The  semiconductor  industry has historically been cyclical and subject to, at
various  times,  significant  economic  downturns  characterized by diminished
product  demand,  accelerated  erosion  of  average  selling  prices  and
overcapacity.  The  Company  may  experience  substantial  period-to-period
fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry
conditions, overall economic conditions or other factors.

Currently,  most of the Company 's operations are centered in an area that has
been seismically active.  Should there be a major earthquake in this area, the
Company  's  operations  may  be  disrupted  resulting in the inability of the
Company  to  ship  products  in  a timely manner, thereby materially adversely
affecting the Company 's business.

In  addition,  the  securities  of  many  high  technology  companies  have
historically  been  subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations which may
adversely affect the market price of the Company 's Common Stock.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The  Company  's financial condition at March 31, 1996 remained strong.  Total
current  assets  exceeded  total current liabilities by 5.2 times, compared to
3.4  times  at  March  31,  1995.  Since its inception, the Company has used a
combination  of  equity  and  debt financing and internal cash flow to support
operations,  make  acquisitions and investments in complementary technologies,
obtain capital equipment and finance inventory and accounts receivable.

Total assets have grown from $320.9 million in 1995 to $720.9 million in 1996.
This  increase  reflects  the net proceeds of $243.9 million received from the
sale   of convertible subordinated notes during the year as well as the year's
favorable  operating results. The percentage changes of selected balance sheet
items from March 1995 to March 1996 are shown below:

     Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-term Investments

Xilinx  's  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  short-term investments increased by
$255.1  million  in  1996  to $378 million. The Company generated cash flow of
approximately  $150.3  million  from  operating  activities in 1996, offset by
$352.7  million  of  cash  used  for  investing  activities,  including  the
acquisition of NeoCAD, the USI joint venture, net purchases of investments and
investments  in  property,  plant  and  equipment.  In  addition,  the Company
generated  $256.7  million  of cash from financing activities, reflecting  the
proceeds  derived  from  the  convertible  debt  offering, which netted $243.9
million,  and $14.2 million of common stock proceeds under employee option and
stock  purchase plans, offset by $1.4 million of principal payments on capital
lease  obligations.  At  March 31, 1996, cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments represented 52% of total assets.

     Receivables

Receivables  grew 81.2% from $43.9 million at the end of 1995 to $79.5 million
at  the end of 1996. The increase in receivables year-to-year is primarily due
to  the greater volume of shipments which occurred in the last month of fiscal
1996.

     Inventories

Inventories  increased 53.4% from $25.6 million at March 1995 to $39.2 million
at  March  1996.  Inventory  levels  at  March  31,  1996 represent 69 days of
inventory,  which  is  consistent  with Company objectives, and compares to 54
days  at  March 31, 1995. The Company confronts dual, contradictory objectives
with  regard  to  inventory  management. On the one hand, the Company believes
that  its  standard,  off-the-shelf  products  should  be available for prompt
shipment  to customers. Accordingly, it attempts to maintain sufficient levels
of  inventory  in  various  product,  range  and  speed configurations to meet
unpredictable  customer  demand.  At the same time, the Company also wishes to
minimize  the  handling  costs  associated with higher inventory levels and to
realize  fully  the  opportunities  for  cost reduction associated with future
manufacturing process advancements. The Company continually strives to balance
these  two  objectives  so  as  to  provide  excellent  customer response at a
competitive  cost.  Year-end inventories as a percentage of the fourth quarter
's cost of revenues increased from 60% in 1995 to 76% in 1996.

     Property, Plant and Equipment

Xilinx  's  investment  in  property  and  equipment was $60.5 million in 1996
compared  to  $26.2  million  in  1995.    The  Company continues to invest in
software  design  tools  and  semiconductor  design,  test  and  manufacturing
equipment.    The  Company  completed  construction  of  a  $32.3  million
manufacturing  facility  in  Dublin,  Ireland in 1996 to establish capacity to
meet  increased product demand. Although the Company anticipates significantly
lower capital expenditures in fiscal 1997 as a result of the completion of the
Ireland facility, significant investments with wafer suppliers are planned for
1997.  See Commitments discussion.

     Current Liabilities

Current  liabilities  grew by 34.9% to $102.6 million at the end of 1996. This
growth  is  primarily  attributable to increased deferred income for shipments
made  to  domestic  distributors,  increased trade payables associated with an
expanded  scale of operations and interest payable relating to the convertible
subordinated notes.

     Line of Credit

The  Company  has  obtained  credit line facilities for up to $47 million (see
Note  5  of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) of which $7 million is
intended  to  meet  occasional working capital requirements for the Company 's
wholly  owned  Irish  subsidiary.    At  March  31,  1996,  no borrowings were
outstanding under the lines of credit.

     Long-term Debt

In  November 1995, the Company issued $250 million in convertible subordinated
notes.  See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. There was no
significant long-term debt in 1995.

     Stockholders ' Equity

Stockholders ' equity grew by 50.9% in 1996 to $368.2 million. The increase of
$124.3  million was primarily attributable to $101.5 million in net income and
$22.1  million  related to the issuance of common stock in accordance with the
Company 's stock plans and the tax benefit from stock options.  Stockholders '
equity as a percentage of total assets was 51.1% for 1996 and 76% for 1995.

     Commitments

The  Company  entered into a series of agreements with United Microelectronics
Corporation  (UMC)  pursuant  to  which the Company has agreed to join UMC and
other parties to form a joint venture for the purpose of building and managing
an  advanced  semiconductor  manufacturing  facility  in Taiwan. See Note 4 of
Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under the terms of the agreement,
the  Company invested $34 million in fiscal 1996 and will invest an additional
$68  million and $34 million in December 1996 and July 1997, respectively, for
a 25% equity interest in the venture. As a result of its equity ownership, the
Company  will  receive rights to purchase at market prices a percentage of the
facility  's  wafer production.  The proposed facility is expected to commence
limited  production  of  eight-inch sub-micron wafers during fiscal 1998.  The
Company is currently receiving eight-inch, sub-micron wafers in limited volume
from  a  recently  constructed foundry in which UMC is the major shareholder. 
Xilinx  believes it will continue to receive such products in moderate volumes
until the proposed facility is operational.

On  May 17, 1996, the Company signed an agreement with Seiko Epson Corporation
(Seiko),  a  primary  wafer  supplier.    See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements.  The agreement provides for an advance to Seiko of $200
million  to  be  used  in  the construction of a wafer fabrication facility in
Japan  which  will  provide  access  to  eight-inch  sub-micron  wafers.    In
conjunction  with  the agreement, $30 million was paid in May 1996 and further
installments  are  scheduled  starting  in  November  1996.  Repayment of this
advance will be in the form of wafer deliveries expected to begin in the first
half  of  1998.  In addition to the advance payments, the Company will provide
further  funding  to  Seiko  in  the  amount  of $100 million. This additional
funding  will  be paid after the final installment of the $200 million advance
and the form of the additional funding will be negotiated at that time.

     Employees

The  number  of Company employees grew by 38% during the past year. Xilinx had
1,201  employees at the end of 1996 as compared to 868 at the end of the prior
year.

The  Company anticipates that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from
operations  will  be  sufficient  to satisfy the Company 's cash needs for the
foreseeable  future.  The  Company will continue to evaluate opportunities for
investments  to  obtain  additional  wafer  supply  capacity,  procurement  of
additional  capital equipment and facilities, development of new products, and
potential  acquisitions  of  businesses,  products  or technologies that would
complement  the  Company  's  businesses  and  may use available cash or other
sources of funding for such purposes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS

Xilinx  designs, develops and markets programmable logic semiconductor devices
and related development system software.  The Company 's product lines include
field  programmable  gate  arrays and complex programmable logic devices.  The
wafers  used  to  manufacture  the  Company  's  products  are  obtained  from
independent  wafer  manufacturers,  located primarily in Japan. The Company is
dependent  upon  these manufacturers to produce and deliver wafers on a timely
basis.    The  Company  is  also  dependent on subcontractors, located in Asia
Pacific,  to  provide  semiconductor  assembly  services.   Xilinx is a global
company  with  manufacturing  facilities  in the United States and Ireland and
sales  offices  throughout  the  world.    The  Company's products are sold to
customers  in  the data processing, telecommunications, networking, industrial
control,  instrumentation and military markets.  The Company derives more than
one-third  of  its  revenues from international sales, primarily in Europe and
Japan.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISKS

     Basis of presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries after elimination of all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company 's fiscal year ends on the
Saturday  nearest  March  31.  For  ease  of  presentation,  March 31 has been
utilized  as  the fiscal year-end for all financial statement captions. Fiscal
years 1996, 1995 and 1994 each consisted of 52 weeks.

     Cash equivalents and  investments

Cash  and  cash  equivalents  consists  of  cash  on  deposit with banks, tax-
advantaged  municipal  bonds, and investments in money market instruments with
insignificant  interest  rate  risk  and  original  maturities  at  date  of
acquisition  of  90  days  or  less.  Short-term  investments  consist  of
tax-advantaged  municipal  bonds  and  corporate bonds with maturities greater
than  90  days  but less than one year. Restricted investments consist of U.S.
Treasury  Securities  held as collateral relating to leases for the Company 's
facilities.  See  Note  6  of  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The
Company  maintains  its  cash,  cash equivalents and short-term investments in
several  financial  instruments  with  various  banks  and  investment banking
institutions.  This  diversification of risk is consistent with Company policy
to maintain liquidity and ensure the safety of principal.

Management classifies investments as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity at
the  time  of  purchase  and  re-evaluates such designation as of each balance
sheet date. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has
the  positive  intent  and  the ability to hold the securities until maturity.
Held-to-maturity  securities  are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization, as well as
any interest on the securities, is included in interest income. Securities not
classified  as  held  to  maturity  are  classified  as  available-for  sale.
Available-for-sale  securities  are  carried at fair value with the unrealized
gains  or losses, net of tax, included as a separate component of stockholders
'  equity.  Realized  gains  and  losses  and  declines  in value judged to be
other-than-temporary  on  available-for-sale  securities are included in other
income. The fair values for marketable debt and equity securities are based on
quoted  market  prices. The cost of securities matured or sold is based on the
specific identification method.


     Inventories

Inventories  are  stated  at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market
(estimated  net  realizable value) and are comprised of the following at March
31, 1996 and 1995:

</TABLE>


     Advances for wafer purchases

During  fiscal  1995,  the  Company  advanced  $42  million to a primary wafer
supplier.  Repayment  of this amount is in the form of wafer deliveries and is
expected  to  be  completed  during  fiscal  1997. Through March 31, 1996, the
Company has received $33 million in wafers against this advance.

     Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed for
financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful  lives  of  the assets of three to five years for machinery, equipment,
furniture  and  fixtures  and  up  to thirty years for buildings. Assets under
capital  leases  are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter
of  the  lease  term or estimated economic life. Depreciation and amortization
for income tax purposes is computed using accelerated methods.

     Deferred income on shipments to distributors

Certain  of  the  Company  's  sales are made to distributors under agreements
allowing  for  price  protection  and  limited  right of return on merchandise
unsold  by the distributors. Because of the uncertainty associated with future
pricing  concessions  and  returns, the Company defers recognition of revenues
and  related  cost  of  revenues  until  the  merchandise  is  sold  by  the
distributors.

     Foreign currency translation

The US dollar is the functional currency for the Company 's Irish subsidiary. 
Assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency are
translated  into US dollars, and the resulting gains or losses are included in
net  income.    The  functional currency is the local currency for each of the
Company  's  other  foreign  subsidiaries.  Translation adjustments, resulting
from  the process of translating foreign currency financial statements into US
dollars,  have not been material and therefore are not disclosed as a separate
component of stockholders ' equity.

     Derivative financial instruments

As  part of its ongoing asset and liability management activities, the Company
enters  into  certain  derivative  financial  arrangements to reduce financial
market risks. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments
for  trading  purposes.  See  Note  5  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.


     Long Lived Assets

In  1995,  the  Financial Accounting Standards Board released the Statement of
Financial  Accounting  Standard  No.  121  (SFAS  121),  "Accounting  for  the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of. "
SFAS  121 requires recognition of impairment of long-lived assets in the event
the  net  book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows
attributable to such assets.  SFAS 121 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after  December  15,  1995.    Adoption  of SFAS 121 is not expected to have a
material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

     Employee stock plans

The Company accounts for its stock option and employee stock purchase plans in
accordance with provisions of the Accounting Principles Board's Opinion No. 25
(APB  25),  "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." In 1995, the Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board  released  the  Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard  No.  123 (SFAS 123), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation." SFAS
123  provides  an  alternative  to  APB  25  and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1995.  The Company expects to continue to account
for  its  employee  stock  plans in accordance with the provisions of APB 25. 
Accordingly,  SFAS  123  is  not  expected  to  have  a material impact on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

     Use of estimates

The  preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting  principles  requires  management to make estimates and assumptions
that  affect  the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements and the
reported  amounts  of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Such
estimates  relate  to  the useful lives of fixed assets and intangible assets,
allowances  for  doubtful  accounts  and customer returns, inventory reserves,
potential  reserves relating to litigation matters and other reserves.  Actual
results  may differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material
to the financial statements.

     Net income per share

Net  income  per  common  and  common  equivalent  share is computed using the
weighted  average  number  of  common  and  dilutive  common equivalent shares
outstanding  during  the  period. Dilutive common equivalent shares consist of
stock  options  (using  the treasury stock method). Fully diluted earnings per
share  is  computed  using  the  weighted  average  common and dilutive common
equivalent shares outstanding, plus other dilutive shares which are not common
equivalent  shares.  The  effect  of  the  convertible  subordinated notes was
antidilutive  in  the  calculation of fully diluted earnings per share for the
periods presented.

     Concentrations of credit risk

The  Company  believes  that  the  concentration  of  credit risk in its trade
receivables  with  respect  to  the  high-technology industry is substantially
mitigated  by  the  Company  's  credit  evaluation  process, relatively short
collection  terms,  distributor agreements, and the geographical dispersion of
sales.  The Company generally does not require collateral. Bad debt write-offs
have been insignificant for all years presented.

     Concentration of other risks

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized by rapid technological change,
intense  competitive  pressure  and  cyclical  market patterns.  The Company's
results  of  operations  are  affected by a wide variety of factors, including
general  economic  conditions  and  conditions  specific  to the semiconductor
industry,  decreases  in  average selling prices over the life of a particular
product,  the  timely  receipt of wafers with competitive performance and cost
attributes,  the  ability to locate and qualify additional wafer suppliers and
subcontractors,  the  timing  of  new  product  introductions,  the  timely
implementation  of  new  manufacturing  technologies, the ability to safeguard
patents  and  intellectual  property  in  a rapidly evolving market, and rapid
escalation of demand for some products in the face of equally steep decline in
demand  for  others.    As  a  result,  the Company may experience substantial
period-to-period  fluctuations  in future operating results due to the factors
mentioned above or other factors.

3. ACQUISITION

On  April  10,  1995,  the  Company  acquired NeoCAD, Inc. (NeoCAD), a private
company  engaged  in  the design, development and sale of FPGA software design
tools  for programmable electronic technologies, for $35 million in cash.  The
transaction  was  treated  as a purchase for accounting purposes; accordingly,
the  purchase  price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed  based  on  their  estimated  fair values.  The excess of the purchase
price  over  the  fair  values  of liabilities assumed, net of tangible assets
acquired,  was  allocated  to in-process technology ($19.4 million), developed
technology  ($15.7  million)  and  the assembled workforce ($0.7 million). The
amount of in-process technology was written-off as a non-recurring item during
the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  1996.  The developed technology and assembled
workforce assets are being amortized over six and two years, respectively.  In
fiscal  1996,  the  Company  recorded  amortization  of  $2.6 million and $0.3
million  relating  to the developed technology and assembled workforce assets,
respectively.

The  following pro forma information reflects the statements of income for the
years  ended  March  31,  1996  and  March  31, 1995 as if the acquisition had
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 1995, and includes certain adjustments for
amortization  of  the  developed  technology  and  assembled workforce assets,
reduced  interest  income  and  the  related  income tax impact. The pro forma
information  excludes  the $19.4 million write-off of in-process technology as
it  represents  a  non-recurring  item.  This pro forma information may not be
indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the combination
had  been  in  effect  on  the dates indicated or which may be realized in the
future.

4. JOINT VENTURE

The  Company, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and other parties have
entered  into  a  joint  venture  to  construct  in Taiwan a wafer fabrication
facility,  which is known as United Silicon Inc. (USI). The Company has agreed
to  invest  a  total  of  $3.75 billion New Taiwan dollars (approximately $136
mil-lion),  which will result in a  25% equity ownership in  the joint venture
and  the right to receive 31.25% of the wafer capacity from this facility.  In
January  1996,  the  Company  invested  $937.5  million  New  Taiwan  dollars

Held-to-maturity  securities  relate  to  certain  collateral requirements for
lease  agreements  associated with the Company's corporate facilities and have
maturities  due  in  one  year  or  less.  See Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

     Derivatives

The  Company  enters  into  currency  forward and option contracts to minimize
foreign exchange risk relating to the Company 's purchase of wafers, which are
primarily  denominated  in  yen.   At March 31, 1996, commitments under option
contracts  to  purchase  yen  in fiscal 1997 were outstanding in the aggregate
amount  of  $18.1  million.  These contracts are accounted for as identifiable
hedges  against wafer purchases.  Realized gains or losses are recognized upon
maturity  of  the  contracts  and are included in cost of sales.  At March 31,
1996,  the fair value of these option contracts was immaterial based on market
exchange rates.  The maturities on these contracts is less than twelve months.

The  Company  has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to eliminate
the  impact of future exchange fluctuations on the US dollar cost of investing
in  the  USI  joint  venture. The contracts require the Company to exchange US
dollars  for  New  Taiwan  dollars and have maturities from nine to twenty-one
months.  The contracts are accounted for as a hedge of an identifiable foreign
currency  commitment.    Realized  gains  or  losses  will  be recognized upon
maturity  of  the  contracts  and  will  be  included in the USI joint venture
investment.    At  March  31, 1996, the outstanding foreign exchange contracts
related  to  the USI joint venture were $101.7 million and these contracts had
an unrealized gain of $1.5 million, which represents their fair value based on
market exchange rates.

The  Company  has  entered  into  a  two  and one half year interest rate swap
agreement  with  a third party in order to reduce risk related to movements in
interest rates.  Under the agreement, which is effective starting in May 1996,
the  Company  has  effectively converted the fixed rate interest rate payments
related  to  $125  million of the Company 's convertible subordinated notes to
variable  rate  interest  payments  without  the  exchange  of  the underlying
principal  amounts.    The  Company  will receive fixed interest rate payments
(equal  to 5.935%) from the third party and is obligated to make variable rate
payments  (equal  to the three month LIBOR rate) to the third party during the
term  of the agreement.  The net amount of interest payments received from the
third  party and interest payments made by the Company to the third party will
be included in interest expense.

During  1995,  the Company completed a reverse repurchase transaction relating
to  $350 million of U.S. Treasury Securities. The transaction was entered into
with  the  intent  of generating net interest income in an increasing interest
rate  environment  and  capital  gains that could be used to offset previously
incurred  capital  losses relating to the non-recurring $2.5 million write-off
of  the investment in Star Semiconductor. As a result of this transaction, the
Company  recorded approximately $9.7 million of interest expense, $4.7 million
of  interest  income  and  $4.8 million of bond premium amortization in 1995. 
Although  the Company has generally invested in more conventional investments,
such  as  municipal  bonds,  the  Company believes that the short sale of U.S.
Treasury  Securities  met the Company 's investment objectives in 1995. Future
investment  strategies  will  be  made  in accordance with investment policies
designed  to  preserve  and enhance corporate assets as such strategies may be
adopted from time to time by the Company 's Board of Directors.

     Long-Term Debt and Lines of Credit

In  November  1995,  the Company completed a private placement of $250 million
aggregate  principal  convertible  subordinated  notes  under Rule 144A of the
Securities  Act  of 1933.  The notes, which mature in 2002, are convertible at
the  option  of  the  note  holders  into  the  Company  's  common stock at a
conversion  price  of $51 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence
of certain events.  The conversion price represented a 24.77% premium over the
closing  price  of  the  Company  's  stock  on November 7, 1995.  Interest is
payable semi-annually at 5.25% per annum.  At any time on or after November 4,
1997,  the  notes  are  redeemable  at the option of the Company at an initial
redemption  price  of  103.75%  of  the principal amount, except that prior to
November 3, 1998, the notes are not redeemable unless the closing price of the
Company  's  common stock has exceeded $71.40 (40% premium over the conversion
price) per share for twenty trading days within a period of thirty consecutive
trading  days.   Redemption prices as a percentage of the principal amount are
103.00%, 102.25%, 101.50% and 100.75% in the years beginning November 1, 1998,
November  1,  1999, November 1, 2000 and November 1, 2001, respectively.  Debt
issuance  costs  of  $6.1 million incurred in conjunction with issuance of the
convertible subordinated notes are being amortized over the seven year life of
the  notes.   In 1996, the Company recorded debt issuance cost amortization of
$0.4  million.    At  March  31,  1996,  the  fair  value  of  the convertible
subordinated  notes  was  approximately  $233.8 million based on quoted market
prices.    The  Company  has reserved 4,901,961 shares of common stock for the
conversion of these notes.

The  Company  has $40 million available under a multicurrency revolving credit
line  agreement  which  expires  on  March  1,  1998.    Under this agreement,
borrowings  bear interest at the bank 's reference rate or 0.75% over the bank
's  interbank  market  rate depending on the currency borrowed.  Additionally,
the Company 's Irish subsidiary has $7 million available under a multicurrency
credit line.  Under this agreement, borrowings bear interest at 0.75% over the
bank  's  prime rate.  At March 31, 1996, no borrowings were outstanding under
either credit line.  The agreements require the Company to comply with certain
covenants  and maintain certain financial ratios.  The agreements prohibit the
payment of cash dividends without prior bank approval.


6. COMMITMENTS

The  Company  leases  its  manufacturing and office facilities under operating
leases  that  expire  at various dates through December 2014. Lease agreements
for the Company 's corporate facilities contain payment provisions which allow
for  changes  in  rental  amounts  based  upon  interest  rate  changes.  The
approximate future minimum lease payments under these leases are as follows:

</TABLE>

The  Company  has  entered  into  lease  agreements  relating to its corporate
facilities  which  would  allow  the  Company to purchase the facilities on or
before  the end of the lease term in December 1999. If at the end of the lease
term the Company does not purchase the property under lease or arrange a third
party  purchase,  then  the  Company  would  be  obligated to the lessor for a
guarantee  payment  equal to a specified percentage of the Company 's purchase
price  for the property. The Company would also be obligated to the lessor for
all  or  some  portion  of this amount if the price paid by the third party is
below  a specified percentage of the Company 's purchase price. The Company is
also  required to comply with certain covenants and maintain certain financial
ratios.  As  of  March  31,  1996,  the  total  amount  related  to the leased
facilities  for  which  the  Company  is contingently liable is $39.8 million.
Under  the  terms  of  the  agreements,  the  Company  is required to maintain
collateral  (restricted  investments)  of approximately $36 million during the
lease term.

7. STOCKHOLDERS ' EQUITY

The Company 's Certificate of Incorporation provides for 200 million shares of
common stock and 2 million shares of undesignated preferred stock.

     Treasury stock

The  Company  authorized a stock buyback program in June 1992 to repurchase up
to  4,500,000 shares of common stock. The Company has used the shares actually
repurchased  to meet the stock requirements of the Company 's Stock Option and
Employee  Qualified  Stock  Purchase  Plans.  Under  this program, the Company
repurchased  3,030,000  shares  of  its common stock on the open market during
1993  for  a  total  cost of $17.4 million.  During 1996 and 1995, the Company
issued  1,430,502  and 1,599,498, respectively, of these shares in response to
stock  option  exercises  and  stock  purchase plan requirements. At March 31,
1996, there were no shares of treasury stock outstanding.

     Employee qualified stock purchase plan

Under  the  Company  's 1990 Employee Qualified Stock Purchase Plan (the Stock
Purchase  Plan), qualified employees are entitled to purchase shares of common
stock  at  85%  of  the  fair  market value at certain specified dates. Of the
2,925,000  shares authorized to be issued under this plan, 537,451 and 635,466
shares were issued during 1996 and 1995, respectively, and 252,050 shares were
available  for issuance at March 31, 1996. In March 1996, the Company 's Board
of  Directors amended the Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares
for  issuance thereunder by 460,000 shares, subject to shareholder approval in
fiscal 1997.

     Employee stock option plan

The  Company  has  adopted  the 1988 Stock Option Plan (the Option Plan) under
which  a  total  of 32,781,000 common shares has been reserved for issuance to
employees,  directors,  and  consultants  of  the Company. Options to purchase
shares  of the Company 's common stock under the Option Plan may be granted at
not  less  than  85%  of  the fair value of the stock on the date of grant. To
date,  no shares have been issued at less than 100% of the fair value. Options
granted  to date expire ten years from date of grant and vest at varying rates
over  five years. In March 1996, the Company 's Board of Directors amended the
Option  Plan to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance thereunder
by 3,300,000 shares, subject to shareholder approval in fiscal 1997.

Additional information relative to the Option Plan is as follows:

$0.12  to  $48.13.  Prices  for options exercised during the three year period
ended March 31, 1996 ranged from $0.12 to $23.42.

     Stock split

On  July  26, 1995, the Company's stockholders approved a 3-for-1 stock split,
in  the  form of a 200% dividend, payable to stockholders of record as of July
28, 1995. Shares, per share amounts, common stock at par value, and additional
paid  in capital have been restated to reflect the stock split for all periods
presented.


     Stockholder Rights Plan

In  October 1991, the Company adopted a stockholder rights plan and declared a
dividend  distribution of one common stock purchase right for each outstanding
share  of  its  common  stock.    The rights become exercisable based upon the
occurrence  of  certain  conditions  including  acquisitions of Company stock,
tender or exchange offers and certain business combination transactions of the
Company.  In the event one of the conditions is triggered, each right entitles
the  registered  holder  to purchase a number of shares of common stock of the
Company  or,  under  limited  circumstances,  of the acquirer.  The rights are
redeemable  at  the  Company's  option  under certain conditions, for $.01 per
right and expire on October 4, 2001.

No  single end customer accounted for more than 6% of revenues in 1996 or 1995
and  4%  of  revenues  in 1994.  Approximately 13%, 14% and 14% of net product
revenues  were  made  through  the  Company 's largest domestic distributor in
1996,  1995  and 1994 respectively, and another domestic distributor accounted
for  10%  of  net  product  revenues  in  1996 and 1995 and 12% of net product
revenues in 1994.

10. LITIGATION

On June 7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in
the  United  States District Court for the Northern District of California for
infringement  of certain of the Company 's patents. Subsequently, Altera filed
suit  against  the  Company  alleging  that certain of the Company 's products
infringe  certain  Altera  patents.  Fact discovery has been completed in both
cases.   No trial date has been set.  The Court has stayed further proceedings
in  both  cases until August 30, 1996 when the next status conference with the
Court is scheduled.

On  April  20,  1995,  Altera  filed an additional suit against the Company in
Federal  District Court in Delaware alleging that the Company 's XC5000 family
infringes  a  certain  Altera  patent.  The Company answered the Delaware suit
denying  that  the  XC5000  family  infringes the patent in suit, which is the
subject  of  the  litigation,  asserting  certain  affirmative  defenses  and
counterclaiming  that  the  Altera  Max  9000  family infringes certain of the
Company's  patents.  The  Delaware suit has now been transferred to the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California.

Due  to  the  uncertain  nature  of the litigation with Altera and because the
lawsuits  are  still  in  the  pre-trial  stage, the ultimate outcome of these
matters  cannot  be  determined at this time.  Management believes that is has
meritorious  defenses to such claims and is defending them vigorously, and has
not  recorded  a  provision  for  the ultimate outcome of these matters in its
financial  statements.  The  foregoing is a forward looking statement based on
information  presently  known  to  management,  and  the  future outcome could
differ.

In the normal course of business, the Company receives and makes inquires with
regard  to  possible  patent infringement. Where deemed advisable, the Company
may  seek  or  extend  licenses  or  negotiate  settlements.  Outcomes of such
negotiations may not be determinable at any point in time; however, management
does  not  believe  that such licenses or settlements will, individually or in
the  aggregate,  have  a  material  adverse effect on the Company 's financial
position or results of operations.

11. SUBSEQUENT EVENT (UNAUDITED)

On  May 17, 1996, the Company signed an agreement with Seiko Epson Corporation
(Seiko),  a  primary wafer supplier.  The agreement provides for an advance to
Seiko  of  $200  million to be used in the construction of a wafer fabrication
facility  in Japan which will provide access to eight-inch sub-micron wafers. 
In  conjunction  with  the  agreement,  $30  million  was paid in May 1996 and
additional installments of $30 million are scheduled for November 1, 1996, May
1,  1997,  November  1,  1997  and  February 1, 1998 or upon the start of mass
production, whichever is later.  The final installment for the advance payment
of  $50 million is due on or after the later of April 1, 1998 and the date the
outstanding  balance  of  the  advance payment is less than $125 million. As a
result,  the  maximum outstanding amount of the advance payment at any time is
$175  million.  Repayment  of  this  advance  will  be  in  the  form of wafer
deliveries  expected  to  begin  in the first half of 1998. In addition to the
advance  payments,  the  Company  will provide further funding to Seiko in the
amount  of  $100 million. This additional funding will be paid after the final
installment of the $200 million advance and the form of the additional funding
will be negotiated at that time.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Xilinx, Inc.

We  have  audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Xilinx, Inc.
as  of  March  31,  1996  and 1995, and the related consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended March 31, 1996.  Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule  listed  in  the Index at Item 14(a).  These financial statements and
schedule  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company's  management.    Our
responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion on these financial statements and

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted auditing
standards.    Those  standards  require  that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting  the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant
estimates  made  by  management,  as  well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present  fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of  Xilinx,  Inc.  at March 31, 1996 and 1995, and the consolidated results of
its  operations  and  its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  March  31,  1996,  in  conformity  with  generally  accepted accounting
principles.  Also,  in  our  opinion, the related financial statement schedule
taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

Notes shall be designated as 5 1/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes
due 2002." Notes not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of

forth in Section 7 of the Placement Agreement dated November 7,
1995 (as amended from time to time by the parties thereto) by and
between the Company and the Initial Purchasers is exercised in
full) (except pursuant to Sections 2.5, 2.6, 3.3, 3.5 and 15.2
hereof) upon the execution of this Indenture, or from time to
time thereafter, may be executed by the Company and delivered to
the Trustee for authentication, and the Trustee shall thereupon
authenticate and deliver said Notes to or upon the written order
of the Company, signed by its (a) President, Executive or Senior
Vice President or any Vice President (whether or not designated
by a number or numbers or word or words added before or after the
title "Vice President") and (b) Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer
or its Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, without any further
action by the Company hereunder.

     Section 2.2    Form of Notes.  The Notes and the Trustee's
certificate of authentication to be borne by such Notes shall be
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A, which is
incorporated in and made a part of this Indenture.

     Any of the Notes may have such letters, numbers or other
marks of identification and such notations, legends and
endorsements as the officers executing the same may approve
(execution thereof to be conclusive evidence of such approval)
and as are not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Indenture, or as may be required to comply with any law or with
any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with any rule or
regulation of any securities exchange or automated quotation
system on which the Notes may be listed, or to conform to usage.

     Any Note in global form shall represent such of the
outstanding Notes as shall be specified therein and shall provide
that it shall represent the aggregate amount of outstanding Notes
from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount
of outstanding Notes represented thereby may from time to time be
increased or reduced to reflect transfers or exchanges permitted
hereby.  Any endorsement of a Note in global form to reflect the
amount of any increase or decrease in the amount of outstanding
Notes represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee or the
Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, in such manner and
upon instructions given by the holder of such Notes in accordance
with this Indenture.  Payment of principal of and interest and
premium, if any, on any Note in global form shall be made to the
holder of such Note.

     The terms and provisions contained in the form of Note
attached as Exhibit A hereto shall constitute, and are hereby
expressly made, a part of this Indenture and, to the extent
applicable, the Company and the Trustee, by their execution and
delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and
provisions and to be bound thereby.

     Section 2.3    Date and Denomination of Notes; Payments of
Interest.  The Notes shall be issuable in registered form without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral
multiples thereof.  Every Note shall be dated the date of its

each case as specified on the face of the form of Note attached
as Exhibit A hereto.

     The person in whose name any Note (or its Predecessor Note)
is registered at the close of business on any record date with
respect to any interest payment date (including any Note that is
converted after the record date and on or before the interest
payment date) shall be entitled to receive the interest payable
on such interest payment date notwithstanding the cancellation of
such Note upon any transfer, exchange or conversion subsequent to
the record date and on or prior to such interest payment date;
provided, that in the case of any Note, or portion thereof,
called for redemption on a redemption date or redeemed in
connection with a Fundamental Change on a Repurchase Date that is
after a record date and prior to (but excluding) the next
succeeding interest payment date, interest shall not be paid to
the person in whose name the Note, or portion thereof, is
registered on the close of business on such record date and the
Company shall have no obligation to pay interest on such Note or
such portion except to the extent required to be paid upon
redemption of such Note or portion thereof pursuant to
Section 3.3 or 3.5 hereof.  Interest may, at the option of the
Company, be paid by check mailed to the address of such person on
the registry kept for such purposes; provided that, with respect
to any holder of Notes with an aggregate principal amount equal
to or in excess of $5,000,000, at the request of such holder in
writing to the Company (who shall then furnish written notice to
such effect to the Trustee), interest on such holder's Notes
shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds in
accordance with the wire transfer instructions supplied by such
holder to the Trustee and paying agent (if different from the
Trustee).  The term "record date" with respect to any interest
payment date shall mean the April 15 or October 15 preceding said
May 1 or November 1, respectively.

     Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a
year of twelve 30-day months.

     Any interest on any Note which is payable, but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any said May 1 or
November 1 (herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Noteholder on the relevant record date
by virtue of his having been such Noteholder; and such Defaulted
Interest shall be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:

          (1)  The Company may elect to make payment of any
     Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Notes
     (or their respective Predecessor Notes) are registered at
     the close of business on a special record date for the
     payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in
     the following manner.  The Company shall notify the Trustee
     in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest to be paid on
     each Note and the date of the payment (which shall be not
     less than twenty-five (25) days after the receipt by the
     Trustee of such notice, unless the Trustee shall consent to
     an earlier date), and at the same time the Company shall
     deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the
     aggregate amount to be paid in respect of such Defaulted
     Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the
     Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed
     payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for
     the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted
     Interest as in this clause provided.  Thereupon the Trustee
     shall fix a special record date for the payment of such
     Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than fifteen (15)
     days and not less than ten (10) days prior to the date of
     the proposed payment and not less than ten (10) days after
     the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed
     payment.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of
     such special record date and, in the name and at the expense
     of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment
     of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date
     therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
     Noteholder as of such special record date at his address as
     it appears in the Note register, not less than ten (10) days
     prior to such special record date.  Notice of the proposed
     payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record
     date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest
     shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or
     their respective Predecessor Notes) were registered at the
     close of business on such special record date and shall no
     longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).

          (2)  The Company may make payment of any Defaulted
     Interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with
     the requirements of any securities exchange and automated
     quotation system on which the Notes may be listed or
     designated for issuance, and upon such notice as may be
     required by such exchange and automated quotation system,
     if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the
     proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of
     payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

     Section 2.4    Execution of Notes.  The Notes shall be
signed in the name and on behalf of the Company by the facsimile
signature of its President, any Executive or Senior Vice
President or any Vice President (whether or not designated by a
number or numbers or word or words added before or after the
title "Vice President") and attested by the facsimile signature
of its Secretary or any of its Assistant Secretaries (which may
be printed, engraved or otherwise reproduced thereon, by
facsimile or otherwise).  Only such Notes as shall bear thereon a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form set forth
on the form of Note attached as Exhibit A hereto, manually
executed by the Trustee (or an authenticating agent appointed by
the Trustee as provided by Section 16.11), shall be entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any
purpose.  Such certificate by the Trustee (or such an
authenticating agent) upon any Note executed by the Company shall
be conclusive evidence that the Note so authenticated has been
duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

     In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any
of the Notes shall cease to be such officer before the Notes so
signed shall have been authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee, or disposed of by the Company, such Notes nevertheless
may be authenticated and delivered or disposed of as though the
person who signed such Notes had not ceased to be such officer of
the Company; and any Note may be signed on behalf of the Company
by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of such
Note, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at
the date of the execution of this Indenture any such person was
not such an officer.

     Section 2.5    Exchange and Registration of Transfer of
Notes: Restrictions on Transfer: Depositary.

          (a)  The Company shall cause to be kept at the
     Corporate Trust Office a register (the register maintained
     in such office and in any other office or agency of the
     Company designated pursuant to Section 5.2 being herein
     sometimes collectively referred to as the "Note register")
     in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may
     prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of
     Notes and of transfers of Notes.  The Note register shall be
     in written form or in any form capable of being converted
     into written form within a reasonably prompt period of time.
     The Trustee is hereby appointed "Note registrar" for the
     purpose of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as
     herein provided.  The Company may appoint one or more co-
     registrars in accordance with Section 5.2.

          Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note
     to the Note registrar or any co-registrar, and satisfaction
     of the requirements for such transfer set forth in this
     Section 2.5, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
     shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the
     designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes
     of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
     principal amount and bearing such restrictive legends as may
     be required by this Indenture.

          Notes may be exchanged for other Notes of any
     authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal
     amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at any
     such office or agency maintained by the Company pursuant to
     Section 5.2.  Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
     exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
     authenticate and deliver, the Notes which the Noteholder
     making the exchange is entitled to receive bearing
     registration numbers not contemporaneously outstanding.

          All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or
     exchange of Notes shall be the valid obligations of the
     Company, evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same
     benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon
     such registration of transfer or exchange.

          All Notes presented or surrendered for registration of
     transfer or for exchange, redemption or conversion shall (if
     so required by the Company or the Note registrar) be duly
     endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument or
     instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company,
     and the Notes shall be duly executed by the Noteholder
     thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

          No service charge shall be made for any registration of
     transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Company may require
     payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or
     other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
     with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes.

          Neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Note
     registrar or any Company-registrar shall be required to
     exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Notes for a
     period of fifteen (15) days next preceding any selection of
     Notes to be redeemed or (b) any Notes or portions thereof
     called for redemption pursuant to Article III or (c) any
     Notes or portion thereof surrendered for conversion pursuant
     to Article XV.

          (b)  So long as the Notes are eligible for book-entry
     settlement with the Depositary, unless otherwise required by
     law, all Notes to be traded on the PORTAL Market or to a
     Person who is not a U.S. Person (as defined in Regulation S)
     who is acquiring the Note in an offshore transaction (a "Non-
     U.S. Person") in accordance with Regulation S shall be
     represented by a Note in global form registered in the name
     of the Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary. The
     transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in such Note
     in global form, which does not involve the issuance of a
     Note in definitive form, shall be effected through the
     Depositary, in accordance with this Indenture (including the
     restrictions on transfer set forth herein) and the
     procedures of the Depositary therefor.

          At any time at the request of the beneficial holder of
     an interest in a Note in global form to obtain a Note in
     definitive form, such beneficial holder shall be entitled to
     obtain a definitive Note upon written request to the Trustee
     and the Custodian in accordance with the standing
     instructions and procedures existing between the Custodian
     and Depositary for the issuance thereof.  Upon receipt of
     any such request, the Trustee, or the Custodian at the
     direction of the Trustee, will cause, in accordance with the
     standing instructions and procedures existing between the
     Depositary and the Custodian, the aggregate principal amount
     of the Note in global form to be reduced by the principal
     amount of the definitive Note issued upon such request to
     such beneficial holder and, following such reduction, the
     Company will execute and the Trustee will authenticate and
     deliver to such beneficial holder (or its nominee) a
     definitive Note or Notes in the appropriate aggregate
     principal amount in the name of such beneficial holder (or
     its nominee) and bearing such restrictive legends as may be
     required by this Indenture.

          Any transfer of a beneficial interest in a Note in
     global form which cannot be effected through book-entry
     settlement must be effected by the delivery to the
     transferee (or its nominee) of a definitive Note or Notes
     registered in the name of the transferee (or its nominee) on
     the books maintained by the Note registrar in accordance
     with the transfer restrictions set forth herein.  With
     respect to any such transfer, the Trustee, or the Custodian
     at the direction of the Trustee, will cause, in accordance
     with the standing instructions and procedures existing
     between the Depositary and the Custodian, the aggregate
     principal amount of the Note in global form to be reduced by
     the principal amount of the beneficial interest in the Note
     in global form being transferred and, following such
     reduction, the Company will execute and the Trustee will
     authenticate and deliver to the transferee (or such
     transferee's nominee, as the case may be), a Note or Notes
     in the appropriate aggregate principal amount in the name of
     such transferee (or its nominee) and bearing such
     restrictive legends as may be required by this Indenture.

          (c)  So long as the Notes are eligible for book-entry
     settlement, or unless otherwise required by law, upon any
     transfer of a definitive Note to a QIB in accordance with
     Rule 144A or a Non-U.S. Person in accordance with Regulation
     S, and upon receipt of the definitive Note or Notes being so
     transferred, together with a certification from the
     transferor that the transferee is a QIB or a Non-U.S. Person
     (or other evidence satisfactory to the Trustee), the Trustee
     shall make, or direct the Custodian to make, an endorsement
     on the Note in global form to reflect an increase in the
     aggregate principal amount of the Notes represented by the
     Note in global form, and the Trustee shall cancel such
     definitive Note or Notes and cause, or direct the Custodian
     to cause, in accordance with the standing instructions and
     procedures existing between the Depositary and the
     Custodian, the aggregate principal amount of Notes
     represented by the Note in global form to be increased
     accordingly; provided that no definitive Note, or portion
     thereof, in respect of which the Company or an Affiliate of
     the Company held any beneficial interest shall be included
     in such Note in global form until such definitive Note is
     freely tradable in accordance with Rule 144(k); provided
     further that the Trustee shall issue Notes in definitive
     form upon any transfer of a beneficial interest in the Note
     in global form to the Company or an Affiliate of the
     Company.

          Any Note in global form may be endorsed with or have
     incorporated in the text thereof such legends or recitals or
     changes not inconsistent with the provisions of this
     Indenture as may be required by the Custodian, the
     Depositary or by the National Association of Securities
     Dealers, Inc. in order for the Notes to be tradeable on the
     PORTAL Market or as may be required for the Notes to be
     tradeable on any other market developed for trading of
     securities pursuant to Rule 144A or Regulation S under the
     Securities Act or required to comply with any applicable law
     or any regulation thereunder or with the rules and
     regulations of any securities exchange or automated
     quotation system upon which the Notes may be listed or
     traded or to conform with any usage with respect thereto, or
     to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which
     any particular Notes are subject.

          (d)  Every Note that bears or is required under this
     Section 2.5(d) to bear the legend set forth in this
     Section 2.5(d) (together with any Common Stock issued upon
     conversion of the Notes and required to bear the legend set
     forth in Section 2.5(e), collectively, the "Restricted
     Securities") shall be subject to the restrictions on
     transfer set forth in this Section 2.5(d) (including those
     set forth in the legend set forth below) unless such
     restrictions on transfer shall be waived by written consent
     of the Company, and the holder of each such Restricted Note,
     by such Noteholder's acceptance thereof, agrees to be bound
     by all such restrictions on transfer.  As used in
     Sections 2.5(d) and 2.5(e), the term "transfer" encompasses
     any sale, pledge, transfer or other disposition whatsoever
     of any Restricted Security.

          Until three (3) years after the original issuance date
     of any Note, any certificate evidencing such Note (and all
     securities issued in exchange therefor or substitution
     thereof, other than Common Stock, if any, issued upon
     conversion thereof, which shall bear the legend set forth in
     Section 2.5(e), if applicable) shall bear a legend in
     substantially the following form, unless otherwise agreed by
     the Company in writing, with written notice thereof to the
     Trustee:

          THE NOTE EVIDENCED HEREBY HAS NOT BEEN AND

          ACCREDITED INVESTOR") OR (C) IT IS NOT A U.S.
          PERSON AND IS ACQUIRING THE NOTE EVIDENCED

          TRUSTEE, AS APPLICABLE), A SIGNED LETTER
          CONTAINING CERTAIN REPRESENTA-TIONS AND
          AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON

          EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANS- ACTION NOT
          SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
          THE SECURITIES ACT.  THIS LEGEND WILL BE
          REMOVED UPON ANY TRANSFER OF THE NOTE
          EVIDENCED HEREBY AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF
          THREE YEARS FROM THE ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF THE
          NOTE EVIDENCED HEREBY.  AS USED HEREIN, THE
          TERMS "OFFSHORE TRANSACTION," "UNITED STATES"
          AND "U.S. PERSON" HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO
          THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES
          ACT.

          Any Note (or security issued in exchange or
     substitution therefor) as to which such restrictions on
     transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms
     may, upon surrender of such Note for exchange to the Note
     registrar in accordance with the provisions of this
     Section 2.5, be exchanged for a new Note or Notes, of like
     tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear
     the restrictive legend required by this Section 2.5(d).

          Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture
     (other than the provisions set forth in this
     Section 2.5(d)), a Note in global form may not be
     transferred as a whole or in part except by the Depositary
     to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the
     Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the
     Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a
     successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor
     Depositary.

          The Depositary shall be a clearing agency registered
     under the Exchange Act.  The Company initially appoints The
     Depository Trust Company to act as Depositary with respect
     to the Notes in global form.  Initially, the global Note
     shall be issued to the Depositary, registered in the name of
     Cede & Co., as the nominee of the Depositary, and deposited
     with the Custodian for Cede & Co.

          If at any time the Depositary for the Note in global
     form notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to
     continue as Depositary for the Note, the Company may appoint
     a successor Depositary with respect to such Note.  If a
     successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within
     ninety (90) days after the Company receives such notice, the
     Company will execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
     Officers' Certificate for the authentication and delivery of
     Notes, will authenticate and deliver, Notes in definitive
     form, in an aggregate principal amount equal to the
     principal amount of the Note in global form, in exchange for
     such Note in global form.

          If a definitive Note is issued in exchange for any
     portion of a Note in global form after the close of business
     at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on any
     record date and before the opening of business at such
     office or agency on the next succeeding interest payment
     date, interest will not be payable on such interest payment
     date in respect of such Note, but will be payable on such
     interest payment date only to the person to whom interest in
     respect of such portion of such Note in global form is
     payable in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

          Definitive Notes issued in exchange for all or a part
     of a Note in global form pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall
     be registered in such names and in such authorized
     denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions
     from its direct or indirect participants or otherwise, shall
     instruct the Trustee.  Upon execution and authentication,
     the Trustee shall deliver such definitive Notes to the
     persons in whose names such definitive Notes are so
     registered.

          At such time as all interests in a Note in global form
     have been redeemed, converted, repurchased, canceled,
     exchanged for definitive Notes, or transferred to a
     transferee who receives definitive Notes thereof, such Note
     in global form shall, upon receipt thereof, be canceled by
     the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and
     instructions existing between the Depositary and the
     Custodian.  At any time prior to such cancellation, if any
     interest in a global Note is exchanged for definitive Notes,
     redeemed, converted, repurchased or canceled, exchanged for
     definitive Notes or transferred to a transferee who receives
     definitive Notes therefor or any definitive Note is
     exchanged or transferred for part of a Note in global form,
     the principal amount of such Note in global form shall, in
     accordance with the standing procedures and instructions
     existing between the Depositary and the Custodian, be
     appropriately reduced or increased, as the case may be, and
     an endorsement shall be made on such Note in global form, by
     the Trustee or the Custodian, at the direction of the
     Trustee, to reflect such reduction or increase.

          (e)  Until three (3) years after the original issuance
     date of any Note, any stock certificate representing Common
     Stock issued upon conversion of such Note shall bear a
     legend in substantially the following form, unless such
     Common Stock has been sold pursuant to a registration
     statement that has been declared effective under the
     Securities Act (and which continues to be effective at the
     time of such transfer) or such Common Stock has been issued
     upon conversion of Notes that have been transferred pursuant
     to a registration statement that has been declared effective
     under the Securities Act, or unless otherwise agreed by the
     Company in writing with written notice thereof to the
     transfer agent:

          THE COMMON STOCK EVIDENCED HEREBY HAS NOT
          BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE
          U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
          "SECURITIES ACT"), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES
          LAWS, AND, ACCORD-INGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED
          OR SOLD WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR
          FOR THE ACCOUNT OR BENEFIT OF U.S. PERSONS
          EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE FOLLOWING
          SENTENCE.  THE HOLDER HEREOF AGREES THAT
          UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THREE YEARS AFTER THE
          ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF THE NOTE UPON THE
          CONVERSION OF WHICH THE COMMON STOCK
          EVIDENCED HEREBY WAS ISSUED: (1) IT WILL NOT
          RESELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THE COMMON STOCK
          EVIDENCED HEREBY EXCEPT (A) TO XILINX, INC.
          OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) INSIDE THE
          UNITED STATES TO A "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL
          BUYER" (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE
          SECURITIES ACT) IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 144A,
          (C) INSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO AN
          INSTITUTIONAL "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" (AS
          DEFINED IN RULE 501(A)(1), (2), (3) OR (7)
          UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) THAT, PRIOR TO SUCH
          TRANSFER, FURNISHES TO BANCBOSTON STATE
          STREET INVESTOR SERVICES, AS TRANSFER AGENT
          (OR A SUCCESSOR TRANSFER AGENT, AS
          APPLICABLE), A SIGNED LETTER CONTAINING
          CERTAIN REPRESENTATIONS AND AGREEMENTS
          RELATING TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF
          THE COMMON STOCK EVIDENCED HEREBY (THE FORM
          OF WHICH LETTER CAN BE OBTAINED FROM SUCH
          TRANSFER AGENT (OR A SUCCESSOR TRANSFER
          AGENT, AS APPLICABLE)), (D) OUTSIDE THE
          UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904
          UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (E) PURSUANT TO THE
          EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY
          RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF
          AVAILABLE), OR (F) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION
          STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE
          UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (AND WHICH CONTINUES
          TO BE EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME OF SUCH
          TRANSFER); (2) PRIOR TO SUCH TRANSFER (OTHER
          THAN A TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSE 1(F)
          ABOVE), IT WILL FURNISH BANCBOSTON STATE
          STREET INVESTOR SERVICES, AS TRANSFER AGENT
          (OR A SUCCESSOR TRANSFER AGENT, AS
          APPLICABLE), SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL
          OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS IT MAY
          REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH
          TRANSFER IS BEING MADE PURSUANT TO AN
          EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT
          SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
          THE SECURITIES ACT AND (3) IT WILL DELIVER TO
          EACH PERSON TO WHOM THE COMMON STOCK
          EVIDENCED HEREBY IS TRANSFERRED (OTHER THAN A
          TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSE 1(F) ABOVE) A
          NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT OF THIS
          LEGEND.  THIS LEGEND WILL BE REMOVED UPON THE
          EARLIER OF THE TRANSFER OF THE COMMON STOCK
          EVIDENCED HEREBY PURSUANT TO CLAUSE 1(F)
          ABOVE OR UPON ANY TRANSFER OF THE COMMON
          STOCK EVIDENCED HEREBY AFTER THE EXPIRATION
          OF THREE YEARS FROM THE ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF
          THE NOTE UPON THE CONVERSION OF WHICH THE
          COMMON STOCK EVIDENCED HEREBY WAS ISSUED OR
          UPON THE EARLIER SATISFACTION OF BANCBOSTON
          STATE STREET INVESTOR SERVICES, AS TRANSFER
          AGENT (OR A SUCCESSOR TRANSFER AGENT, AS
          APPLICABLE), THAT THE COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN
          OR IS BEING OFFERED AND SOLD IN COMPLIANCE
          WITH RULE 904 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.  AS
          USED HEREIN, THE TERMS "UNITED STATES" AND
          "U.S. PERSON" HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM
          BY REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

          Any such Common Stock as to which such restrictions on
     transfer shall have expired in accordance with their terms
     may, upon surrender of the certificates representing such
     shares of Common Stock for exchange in accordance with the
     procedures of the transfer agent for the Common Stock, be
     exchanged for a new certificate or certificates for a like
     number of shares of Common Stock, which shall not bear the
     restrictive legend required by this Section 2.5(e).

          (f)  Any certificate evidencing a Note that has been
     transferred to an Affiliate of the Company within three
     years after the original issuance date of the Note, as
     evidenced by a notation on the Assignment Form for such
     transfer or in the representation letter delivered in
     respect thereof, shall, until three years after the last
     date on which the Company or any Affiliate of the Company
     was an owner of such Note, bear a legend in substantially
     the following form, unless otherwise agreed by the Company
     (with written notice thereof to the Trustee):

          THE NOTE EVIDENCED HEREBY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED
          UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
          (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR ANY STATE SECURITIES
          LAWS, AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE OFFERED OR SOLD
          WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR TO, OR FOR THE ACCOUNT
          OR BENEFIT OF, U.S. PERSONS EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN
          THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE.  BY ITS ACQUISITION
          HEREOF, THE HOLDER AGREES (1) THAT IT WILL NOT
          RESELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THE NOTE EVIDENCED
          HEREBY OR THE COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON
          CONVERSION OF SUCH NOTE EXCEPT (A) TO XILINX, INC.
          OR ANY SUBSIDIARY THEREOF, (B) IN A TRANSACTION
          REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OR (C)
          PURSUANT TO THE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
          PROVIDED BY RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (IF
          AVAILABLE) AND (2) THAT IT WILL DELIVER TO EACH
          PERSON TO WHOM THE NOTE EVIDENCED HEREBY IS
          TRANSFERRED A NOTICE SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE EFFECT
          OF THIS LEGEND.  THIS LEGEND SHALL BE REMOVED UPON
          THE TRANSFER OF THE NOTE EVIDENCED HEREBY OR THE
          COMMON STOCK ISSUABLE UPON CONVERSION OF SUCH NOTE
          PURSUANT TO THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE.
          IF THE PROPOSED TRANSFER IS PURSUANT TO THE
          EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY RULE 144
          UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, THE HOLDER MUST, PRIOR
          TO SUCH TRANSFER, FURNISH STATE STREET BANK AND
          TRUST COMPANY, AS TRUSTEE (OR A SUCCESSOR TRUSTEE,
          AS APPLICABLE), SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL
          OPINIONS OR OTHER INFORMATION AS THE COMPANY MAY
          REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH TRANSFER
          IS BEING MADE PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN
          A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION
          REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.  AS USED
          HEREIN, THE TERMS "UNITED STATES" AND "U.S.
          PERSON" HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY
          REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT.

          Any stock certificate representing Common Stock issued
     upon conversion of such Note shall also bear a legend in
     substantially the form indicated above, unless otherwise
     agreed by the Company (with written notice thereof to the
     Trustee).

          (g)  Notwithstanding any provision of Section 2.5 to
     the contrary, in the event Rule 144(k) as promulgated under
     the Securities Act (or any successor rule) is amended to
     shorten the three-year period under Rule 144(k) (or the
     corresponding period under any successor rule), from and
     after receipt by the Trustee of the Officers' Certificate
     and Opinion of Counsel provided for in this Section 2.5(g),
     (i) the references in the first sentence of the second
     paragraph of Section 2.5(d) to "three (3) years" and in the
     restrictive legend set forth in such paragraph to "THREE
     YEARS" shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to be
     references to such shorter period, (ii) the references in
     the first paragraph of Section 2.5(e) to "three (3) years"
     and in the restrictive legend set forth in such paragraph to
     "THREE YEARS" shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to be
     references to such shorter period and (iii) all
     corresponding references in the Notes and the restrictive
     legends thereon shall be deemed for all purposes hereof to
     be references to such shorter period, provided that such
     changes shall not become effective if they are otherwise
     prohibited by, or would otherwise cause a violation of, the
     then-applicable federal securities laws.  As soon as
     practicable after the Company has knowledge of the
     effectiveness of any such amendment to shorten the three-
     year period under Rule 144(k) (or the corresponding period
     under any successor rule), unless such changes would
     otherwise be prohibited by, or would otherwise cause a
     violation of, the then-applicable securities laws, the
     Company shall provide to the Trustee an Officers'
     Certificate and Opinion of Counsel informing the Trustee of
     the effectiveness of such amendment and the effectiveness of
     the foregoing changes to Sections 2.5(d) and 2.5(e) and the
     Notes.  This Section 2.5(g) shall apply to successive
     amendments to Rule 144(k) (or any successor rule) shortening
     the holding period thereunder.

     Section 2.6    Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes.
In case any Note shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or
stolen, the Company in its discretion may execute, and upon its
request the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, a new Note, bearing a
number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and
substitution for the mutilated Note, or in lieu of and in
substitution for the Note so destroyed, lost or stolen.  In every
case the applicant for a substituted Note shall furnish to the
Company, to the Trustee and, if applicable, to such
authenticating agent such security or indemnity as may be
required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss,
liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such
substitution, and, in every case of destruction, loss or theft,
the applicant shall also furnish to the Company, to the Trustee
and, if applicable, to such authenticating agent evidence to
their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Note
and of the ownership thereof.

     The Trustee or such authenticating agent may authenticate
any such substituted Note and deliver the same upon the receipt
of such security or indemnity as the Trustee, the Company and, if
applicable, such authenticating agent may require.  Upon the
issuance of any substituted Note, the Company may require the
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
any other expenses connected therewith.  In case any Note which
has matured or is about to mature or has been called for
redemption or is about to be converted into Common Stock shall
become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company
may, instead of issuing a substitute Note, pay or authorize the
payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same
(without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated
Note), as the case may be, if the applicant for such payment or
conversion shall furnish to the Company, to the Trustee and, if
applicable, to such authenticating agent such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them
harmless for any loss, liability, cost or expense caused by or
connected with such substitution, and, in case of destruction,
loss or theft, evidence satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee
and, if applicable, any paying agent or conversion agent of the
destruction, loss or theft of such Note and of the ownership
thereof.

     Every substitute Note issued pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 2.6 by virtue of the fact that any Note is
destroyed, lost or stolen shall constitute an additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the
destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be found at any time, and
shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be subject to
all the limitations set forth in) this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Notes duly issued
hereunder.  To the extent permitted by law, all Notes shall be
held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing
provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement or
payment or conversion of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies
notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted
to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment or
conversion of negotiable instruments or other securities without
their surrender.

     Section 2.7    Temporary Notes.  Pending the preparation of
definitive Notes, the Company may execute and the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee shall, upon the
written request of the Company, authenticate and deliver
temporary Notes (printed or lithographed).  Temporary Notes shall
be issuable in any authorized denomination, and substantially in
the form of the definitive Notes, but with such omissions,
insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary
Notes, all as may be determined by the Company.  Every such
temporary Note shall be executed by the Company and authenticated
by the Trustee or such authenticating agent upon the same
conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with the
same effect, as the definitive Notes.  Without unreasonable delay
the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee or such
authenticating agent definitive Notes (other than in the case of
Notes in global form) and thereupon any or all temporary Notes
(other than any such Note in global form) may be surrendered in
exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained by the
Company pursuant to Section 5.2 and the Trustee or such
authenticating agent shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
for such temporary Notes an equal aggregate principal amount of
definitive Notes.  Such exchange shall be made by the Company at
its own expense and without any charge therefor.  Until so
exchanged, the temporary Notes shall in all respects be entitled
to the same benefits and subject to the same limitations under
this Indenture as definitive Notes authenticated and delivered
hereunder.

     Section 2.8    Cancellation of Notes Paid, Etc.  All Notes
surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption, conversion,
exchange or registration of transfer, shall, if surrendered to
the Company or any paying agent or any Note registrar or any
conversion agent, be surrendered to the Trustee and promptly
canceled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be
promptly canceled by it, and no Notes shall be issued in lieu
thereof except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of
this Indenture.  The Trustee shall destroy canceled Notes (unless
the Company directs it to do otherwise) and, after such
destruction, shall, if requested by the Company, deliver a
certificate of such destruction to the Company.  If the Company
shall acquire any of the Notes, such acquisition shall not
operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness
represented by such Notes unless and until the same are delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation.


                          ARTICLE III

                      REDEMPTION OF NOTES

     Section 3.1    Redemption Prices.  The Company may not
redeem the Notes prior to November 4, 1997.  At any time on or
after November 4, 1997, the Company may, at its option, redeem
all or from time to time any part of the Notes on any date prior
to maturity, upon notice as set forth in Section 3.2, and at the
optional redemption prices set forth in the form of Note attached
as Exhibit A hereto, together with accrued interest to, but
excluding, the date fixed for redemption, except that prior to
November 3, 1998 the Notes will not be redeemable at the option
of the Company unless the Closing Price of the Common Stock shall
have exceeded the product of the Conversion Price then in effect
times 140% (rounded to the nearest cent) for 20 Trading Days
within a period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending within five
Trading Days prior to the notice of redemption.

     Section 3.2    Notice of Redemption: Selection of Notes.  In
case the Company shall desire to exercise the right to redeem all
or, as the case may be, any part of the Notes pursuant to
Section 3.1, it shall fix a date for redemption and it or, at its
request, the Trustee in the name of and at the expense of the
Company, shall mail or cause to be mailed a notice of such
redemption at least 30 and not more than 60 days prior to the
date fixed for redemption to the holders of Notes so to be
redeemed as a whole or in part at their last addresses as the
same appear on the Note register (provided that if the Company
shall give such notice, it shall also give written notice, and
written notice of the Notes to be redeemed, to the Trustee).
Such mailing shall be by first class mail.  The notice if mailed
in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to
have been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such
notice.  In any case, failure to give such notice by mail or any
defect in the notice to the holder of any Note designated for
redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of
the proceedings for the redemption of any other Note.

     Each such notice of redemption shall specify the aggregate
principal amount of Notes to be redeemed, the date fixed for
redemption, the redemption price at which Notes are to be
redeemed, the place or places of payment, that payment will be
made upon presentation and surrender of such Notes, that interest
accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as
specified in said notice, and that on and after said date
interest thereon or on the portion thereof to be redeemed will
cease to accrue.  Such notice shall also state the current
Conversion Price and the date on which the right to convert such
Notes or portions thereof into Common Stock will expire.  If
fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the notice of
redemption shall identify the Notes to be redeemed.  In case any
Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption
shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed and shall state that on and after the date fixed for
redemption, upon surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be
issued.

     On or prior to the redemption date specified in the notice
of redemption given as provided in this Section 3.2, the Company
will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying agents
(or, if the Company is acting as its own paying agent, set aside,
segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 5.4) an amount
of money sufficient to redeem on the redemption date all the
Notes (or portions thereof) so called for redemption (other than
those theretofore surrendered for conversion into Common Stock)
at the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued
interest to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption;
provided that if such payment is made on the redemption date it
must be received by the Trustee or paying agent, as the case may
be, by 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on such date.  If any Note
called for redemption is converted pursuant hereto, any money
deposited with the Trustee or any paying agent or so segregated
and held in trust for the redemption of such Note shall be paid
to the Company upon its written request, or, if then held by the
Company shall be discharged from such trust.  If fewer than all
the Notes are to be redeemed, the Company will give the Trustee
written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate not fewer
than forty-five (45) days (or such shorter period of time as may
be acceptable to the Trustee) prior to the redemption date as to
the aggregate principal amount of Notes to be redeemed.

     If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed, the Trustee
shall select the Notes or portions thereof to be redeemed (in
principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof), by
lot or, in its discretion, on a pro rata basis.  If any Note
selected for partial redemption is converted in part after such
selection, the converted portion of such Note shall be deemed (so
far as may be) to be the portion to be selected for redemption.
The Notes (or portions thereof) so selected shall be deemed duly
selected for redemption for all purposes hereof, notwithstanding
that any such Note is converted as a whole or in part before the
mailing of the notice of redemption.

     Upon any redemption of less than all Notes, the Company and
the Trustee may (but need not) treat as outstanding any Notes
surrendered for conversion during the period of fifteen (15) days
next preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption and may (but
need not) treat as outstanding any Note authenticated and
delivered during such period in exchange for the unconverted
portion of any Note converted in part during such period.

     Section 3.3    Payment of Notes Called for Redemption.  If
notice of redemption has been given as above provided, the Notes
or portion of Notes with respect to which such notice has been
given shall, unless converted into Common Stock pursuant to the
terms hereof, become due and payable on the (but excluding) date
and at the place or places stated in such notice at the
applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued to
(but excluding) the date fixed for redemption, and on and after
said date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of
such Notes at the redemption price, together with interest
accrued to said date) interest on the Notes or portion of Notes
so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and such Notes
shall cease after the close of business on the Business Day next
preceding the date fixed for redemption to be convertible into
Common Stock and, except as provided in Sections 8.5 and 13.4, to
be entitled to any benefit or security under this Indenture, and
the holders thereof shall have no right in respect of such Notes
except the right to receive the redemption price thereof and
unpaid interest to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption.
On presentation and surrender of such Notes at a place of payment
in said notice specified, the said Notes or the specified
portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by the Company at the
applicable redemption price, together with interest accrued
thereon to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption;
provided that, if the applicable redemption date is an interest
payment date, the semi-annual payment of interest becoming due on
such date shall be payable to the holders of such Notes
registered as such on the relevant record date instead of the
holders surrendering such Notes for redemption on such date.

     Upon presentation of any Note redeemed in part only, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a
new Note or Notes, of authorized denominations, in principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Notes so presented.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall not redeem
any Notes or mail any notice of optional redemption during the
continuance of a default in payment of interest or premium on the
Notes or of any Event of Default of which, in the case of any
Event of Default other than under Sections 7.1(a) or 7.1(b), a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee has knowledge.  If any Note
called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof
for redemption, the principal and premium, if any, shall, until
paid or duly provided for, bear interest from the date fixed for
redemption at the rate borne by the Note and such Note shall
remain convertible into Common Stock until the principal and
premium, if any, shall have been paid or duly provided for.

     Section 3.4    Conversion Arrangement on Call for
Redemption.  In connection with any redemption of Notes, the
Company may arrange for the purchase and conversion of any Notes
by an agreement with one or more investment bankers or other
purchasers to purchase such Notes by paying to the Trustee in
trust for the Noteholders, on or before the date fixed for
redemption, an amount not less than the applicable redemption
price, together with interest accrued to (but excluding) the date
fixed for redemption, of such Notes.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article III, the obligation of the
Company to pay the redemption price of such Notes, together with
interest accrued to (but excluding) the date fixed for
redemption, shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged to the
extent such amount is so paid by such purchasers.  If such an
agreement is entered into, a copy of which will be filed with the
Trustee prior to the date fixed for redemption, any Notes not
duly surrendered for conversion by the holders thereof may, at
the option of the Company, be deemed, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, acquired by such purchasers from such holders
and (notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Article XV) surrendered by such purchasers for conversion, all as
of immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed
for redemption (and the right to convert any such Notes shall be
extended through such time), subject to payment of the above
amount as aforesaid.  At the direction of the Company, the
Trustee shall hold and dispose of any such amount paid to it in
the same manner as it would monies deposited with it by the
Company for the redemption of Notes.  Without the Trustee's prior
written consent, no arrangement between the Company and such
purchasers for the purchase and conversion of any Notes shall
increase or otherwise affect any of the powers, duties,
responsibilities or obligations of the Trustee as set forth in
this Indenture, and the Company agrees to indemnify the Trustee
from, and hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or
expense arising out of or in connection with any such arrangement
for the purchase and conversion of any Notes between the Company
and such purchasers to which the Trustee has not consented in
writing, including the costs and expenses, including reasonable
legal fees, incurred by the Trustee in the defense of any claim
or liability arising out of or in connection with the exercise or
performance of any of its powers, duties, responsibilities or
obligations under this Indenture.



     Section 3.5    Redemption at Option of Holders.

          (a)  If there shall occur a Fundamental Change, then
     each Noteholder shall have the right, at such holder's
     option, to require the Company to redeem all of such
     holder's Notes, or any portion thereof that is an integral
     multiple of $1,000 principal amount, on the date (the
     "Repurchase Date") that is 30 days after the date of the
     Company Notice (as defined in Section 3.5(b) below) of such
     Fundamental Change (or, if such 30th day is not a Business
     Day, the next succeeding Business Day).  Such repayment
     shall be made at the following prices (expressed as
     percentages of the principal amount) in the event of a
     Fundamental Change occurring during the 12-month period
     beginning November 1:

     <TABLE>
     <CAPTION>

     Year          Percentage      Year        Percentage
     <S>           <C>             <C>         <C>

     1995          105.250%        1999        102.250%

     1996          104.500%        2000        101.500%

     1997          103.750%        2001        100.750%

     1998          103.000%

     </TABLE>

     and 100% at November 1, 2002; provided that if the
     Applicable Price with respect to the Fundamental Change is
     less than the Reference Market Price, the Company shall
     redeem such Notes at a price equal to the foregoing
     redemption price multiplied by the fraction obtained by
     dividing the Applicable Price by the Reference Market Price;
     provided that if such repayment date is May 1 or November 1,
     then the interest payable on such date shall be paid to the
     holder of record of the Note on the next preceding April 15
     or October 15.  In each case, the Company shall also pay to
     such holders accrued interest to, but excluding, the
     Repurchase Date on the redeemed Notes.

          Upon presentation of any Note redeemed in part only,
     the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate
     and deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the
     Company, a new Note or Notes, of authorized denominations,
     in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the
     Notes so presented.

          (b)  On or before the tenth day after the occurrence of
     a Fundamental Change, the Company, or, at its request (which
     must be received by the Trustee at least five Business Days
     prior to the date the Trustee is requested to give notice as
     described below), the Trustee in the name of and at the
     expense of the Company, shall mail or cause to be mailed to
     all holders of record on the date of the Fundamental Change
     a notice (the "Company Notice") of the occurrence of such
     Fundamental Change and of the redemption right at the option
     of the holders arising as a result thereof.  Such notice
     shall be mailed in the manner and with the effect set forth
     in the first paragraph of Section 3.2.  The Company shall
     also deliver a copy of the Company Notice to the Trustee at
     such time as it is mailed to Noteholders.

          Each Company Notice shall specify the circumstances
     constituting the Fundamental Change, the Repurchase Date,
     the price at which the Company shall be obligated to redeem
     Notes, the latest time on the Repurchase Date by which the
     holder must exercise the redemption right (the "Fundamental
     Change Expiration Time"), that the holder shall have the
     right to withdraw any Notes surrendered prior to the
     Fundamental Change Expiration Time, a description of the
     procedure which a Noteholder must follow to exercise such
     redemption right and to withdraw any surrendered Notes, the
     place or places where the holder is to surrender such
     holder's Notes, and the amount of interest accrued on each
     Note to the Repurchase Date.

          No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices
     and no defect therein shall limit the Noteholders'
     redemption rights or affect the validity of the proceedings
     for the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to this
     Section 3.5.

          (c)  For a Note to be so repaid at the option of the
     holder, the Company must receive at the office or agency of
     the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of
     Manhattan, The City of New York or, at the option of such
     holder, the Corporate Trust Office, such Note with the form
     entitled "Option to Elect Repayment Upon A Fundamental
     Change" on the reverse thereof duly completed, together with
     such Notes duly endorsed for transfer, on or before the
     Fundamental Change Expiration Time.  All questions as to the
     validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and
     acceptance of any Note for repayment shall be determined by
     the Company, whose determination shall be final and binding
     absent manifest error.

          (d)  On or prior to the Repurchase Date, the Company
     will deposit with the Trustee or with one or more paying
     agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own paying
     agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in
     Section 5.4) an amount of money sufficient to repay on the
     Repurchase Date all the Notes to be repaid on such date at
     the appropriate redemption price, together with accrued
     interest to (but excluding) the Repurchase Date; provided
     that if such payment is made on the Repurchase Date it must
     be received by the Trustee or paying agent, as the case may
     be, by 10:00 a.m. New York City time, on such date.  Payment
     for Notes surrendered for redemption (and not withdrawn)
     prior to the Fundamental Change Expiration Time will be made
     promptly (but in no event more than three Business Days)
     following the Repurchase Date by mailing checks for the
     amount payable to the holders of such Notes entitled thereto
     as they shall appear on the registry books of the Company.


                           ARTICLE IV

                     SUBORDINATION OF NOTES

     Section 4.1    Agreement of Subordination.  The Company
covenants and agrees, and each holder of Notes issued hereunder
by his acceptance thereof likewise covenants and agrees, that all
Notes shall be issued subject to the provisions of this
Article IV; and each Person holding any Note, whether upon
original issue or upon transfer, assignment or exchange thereof,
accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions.

     The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on all Notes (including, but not limited to, the
redemption price with respect to the Notes called for redemption
in accordance with Section 3.2 or submitted for redemption in
accordance with Section 3.5, as the case may be, as provided in
the Indenture) issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the
manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and subject in
right of payment to the prior payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness, whether outstanding at the date of this Indenture
or thereafter incurred.

     No provision of this Article IV shall prevent the occurrence
of any default or Event of Default hereunder.

     Section 4.2    Payments to Noteholders.  No payment shall be
made with respect to the principal of, or premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes (including, but not limited to, the
redemption price with respect to the Notes to be called for
redemption in accordance with Section 3.2 or submitted for
redemption in accordance with Section 3.5, as the case may be, as
provided in the Indenture), except payments and distributions
made by the Trustee as permitted by the first or second paragraph
of Section 4.5, if:

          (i)  a default in the payment of principal, premium,
     interest, rent or other obligations due on any Senior
     Indebtedness occurs and is continuing (or, in the case of
     Senior Indebtedness for which there is a period of grace, in
     the event of such a default that continues beyond the period
     of grace, if any, specified in the instrument or lease
     evidencing such Senior Indebtedness), unless and until such
     default shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased
     to exist; or

          (ii) a default, other than a payment default, on a
     Designated Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that
     then permits holders of such Designated Senior Indebtedness
     to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a notice
     of the default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from a Person
     who may give it pursuant to Section 4.5 hereof.

     If the Trustee receives any Payment Blockage Notice pursuant
to clause (ii) above, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall
be effective for purposes of this Section unless and until (A) at
least 365 days shall have elapsed since the effectiveness of the
immediately prior Payment Blockage Notice, and (B) all scheduled
payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes
that have come due have been paid in full in cash.  No
nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of
delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be,
or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice.

     The Company may and shall resume payments on and
distributions in respect of the Notes upon the earlier of:

     (1)  the date upon which the default is cured or waived, or

     (2)  in the case of a default referred to in clause (ii)
above, 179 days pass after notice is received if the maturity of
such Designated Senior Indebtedness has not been accelerated,

unless this Article IV otherwise prohibits the payment or
distribution at the time of such payment or distribution.

     Upon any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets
of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities, to creditors upon any dissolution or
winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or other proceedings, all amounts due or to become
due upon all Senior Indebtedness shall first be paid in full in
cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness, or payment thereof in accordance with its terms
provided for in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders
of such Senior Indebtedness before any payment is made on account
of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes
(except payments made pursuant to Article XIII from monies
deposited with the Trustee pursuant thereto prior to commencement
of proceedings for such dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or
reorganization); and upon any such dissolution or winding-up or
liquidation or reorganization of the Company or bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or other proceeding, any payment by the
Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities, to which the
holders of the Notes or the Trustee would be entitled, except for
the provision of this Article IV, shall (except as aforesaid) be
paid by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy,
liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or
distribution, or by the holders of the Notes or by the Trustee
under this Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness (pro rata to such holders on the
basis of the respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by
such holders, or as otherwise required by law or a court order)
or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or
trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments
evidencing any Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their
respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay
all Senior Indebtedness in full, in cash or other payment
satisfactory to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, after
giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to or for
the holders of Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or
distribution is made to the holders of the Notes or to the
Trustee.

     For purposes of this Article IV, the words, "cash, property
or securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of
the Company as reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the
Company or any other corporation provided for by a plan of
reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is
subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article IV
with respect to the Notes to the payment of all Senior
Indebtedness which may at the time be outstanding; provided that
(i) the Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new corporation, if
any, resulting from any reorganization or readjustment, and (ii)
the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness (other than
leases which are not assumed by the Company or the new
corporation, as the case may be) are not, without the consent of
such holders, altered by such reorganization or readjustment.
The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or
dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer
of its property as an entirety, or substantially as an entirety,
to another corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for
in Article XII shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this
Section 4.2 if such other corporation shall, as a part of such
consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer, comply with the
conditions stated in Article XII.

     In the event of the acceleration of the Notes because of an
Event of Default, no payment or distribution shall be made to the
Trustee or any holder of Notes in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (including, but not
limited to, the redemption price with respect to the Notes called
for redemption in accordance with Section 3.2 or submitted for
redemption in accordance with Section 3.5, as the case may be, as
provided in the Indenture), except payments and distributions
made by the Trustee as permitted by the first or second paragraph
of Section 4.5, until all Senior Indebtedness has been paid in
full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness or such acceleration is rescinded in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture.  If payment of the
Notes is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company
shall promptly notify holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
acceleration.

     In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions,
any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind
or character, whether in cash, property or securities (including,
without limitation, by way of setoff or otherwise), prohibited by
the foregoing, shall be received by the Trustee or the holders of
the Notes before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full in cash
or other payment satisfactory to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness, or provision is made for such payment thereof in
accordance with its terms in cash or other payment satisfactory
to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, such payment or
distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall
be paid over or delivered to the holders of Senior Indebtedness
or their representative or representatives, or to the trustee or
trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any instruments
evidencing any Senior Indebtedness may have been issued, as their
respective interests may appear, as calculated by the Company,
for application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness
remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay all Senior
Indebtedness in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness, after giving effect to any
concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of such
Senior Indebtedness.

     Nothing in this Section 4.2 shall apply to claims of, or
payments to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 8.6.  This
Section 4.2 shall be subject to the further provisions of
Section 4.5.

     Section 4.3    Subrogation of Notes.  Subject to the payment
in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the rights of the holders of
the Notes shall be subrogated to the extent of the payments or
distributions made to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness
pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV (equally and
ratably with the holders of all indebtedness of the Company which
by its express terms is subordinated to other indebtedness of the
Company to substantially the same extent as the Notes are
subordinated and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to
the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive
payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the
Company applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the
principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes shall be
paid in full; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no
payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the
holders of the Notes or the Trustee would be entitled except for
the provisions of this Article IV, and no payment over pursuant
to the provisions of this Article IV, to or for the benefit of
the holders of Senior Indebtedness by holders of the Notes or the
Trustee, shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than
holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the holders of the Notes, be
deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of the
Senior Indebtedness; and no payments or distributions of cash,
property or securities to or for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes pursuant to the subrogation provisions of this
Article IV, which would otherwise have been paid to the holders
of Senior Indebtedness shall be deemed to be a payment by the
Company to or for the account of the Notes.  It is understood
that the provisions of this Article IV are and are intended
solely for the purposes of defining the relative rights of the
holders of the Notes, on the one hand, and the holders of the
Senior Indebtedness, on the other hand.

     Nothing contained in this Article IV or elsewhere in this
Indenture or in the Notes is intended to or shall impair, as
among the Company, its creditors other than the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, and the holders of the Notes, the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the
holders of the Notes the principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest on the Notes as and when the same shall become due and
payable in accordance with their terms, or is intended to or
shall affect the relative rights of the holders of the Notes and
creditors of the Company other than the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the
Trustee or the holder of any Note from exercising all remedies
otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this
Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article IV
of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash,
property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise
of any such remedy.

     Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company
referred to in this Article IV, the Trustee, subject to the
provisions of Section 8.1, and the holders of the Notes shall be
entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of
competent jurisdiction in which such bankruptcy, dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are
pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy,
liquidating trustee, agent or other person making such payment or
distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the holders of the
Notes, for the purpose of ascertaining the persons entitled to
participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the amount
thereof or payable thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto
or to this Article IV.

     Section 4.4    Authorization to Effect Subordination.  Each
holder of a Note by the holders acceptance thereof authorizes and
directs the Trustee on the holder's behalf to take such action as
may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination
as provided in this Article IV and appoints the Trustee to act as
the holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.  If
the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of
debt in the form required in any proceeding referred to in the
third paragraph of Section 7.2 hereof at least 30 days before the
expiration of the time to file such claim, the holders of any
Senior Indebtedness or their representatives are hereby
authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the
holders of the Notes.

     Section 4.5    Notice to Trustee.  The Company shall give
prompt written notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate to
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee and to any paying agent of
any fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of
any payment of monies to or by the Trustee or any paying agent in
respect of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article IV or
any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be
charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would
prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee
in respect of the Notes pursuant to the provisions of this
Article IV, unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee
shall have received written notice thereof at the Corporate Trust
Office from the Company (in the form of an Officers' Certificate)
or a holder or holders of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee
thereof; and before the receipt of any such written notice, the
Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, shall be
entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts exist;
provided that if on a date not fewer than two Business Days prior
to the date upon which by the terms hereof any such monies may
become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation,
the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest
on any Note) the Trustee shall not have received, with respect to
such monies, the notice provided for in this Section 4.5, then,
anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive such
monies and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were
received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary
which may be received by it on or after such prior date.

     Notwithstanding anything in this Article IV to the contrary,
nothing shall prevent (a) any payment by the Company or the
Trustee to the Trustee or Noteholders of amounts in connection
with a redemption of Notes (including a redemption pursuant to
Section 3.5) if (i) notice of such redemption has been given
pursuant to Article III prior to the receipt by the Trustee of
written notice as aforesaid, and (ii) such notice of redemption
is given not earlier than sixty (60) days before the redemption
date or (b) any payment by the Trustee to the Noteholders of
monies deposited with it pursuant to Section 13.1, and any such
payment shall not be subject to the provisions of Section 4.1 or
4.2.

     The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, shall
be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by
a person representing himself to be a holder of Senior
Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of such holder) to establish
that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior
Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or
holders.  In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith
that further evidence is required with respect to the right of
any person as a holder of Senior Indebtedness to participate in
any payment or distribution pursuant to this Article IV, the
Trustee may request such person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior
Indebtedness held by such person, the extent to which such person
is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and
any other facts pertinent to the rights of such person under this
Article IV, and if such evidence is not furnished the Trustee may
defer any payment to such person pending judicial determination
as to the right of such person to receive such payment.

     Section 4.6    Trustee's Relation to Senior Indebtedness.
The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all
the rights set forth in this Article IV in respect of any Senior
Indebtedness at any time held by it, to the same extent as any
other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in Section 8.13
or elsewhere in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any
of its rights as such holder.

     With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the
Trustee undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its
covenants and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
Article IV, and no implied covenants or obligations with respect
to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read into this
Indenture against the Trustee.  The Trustee shall not be deemed
to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness
and, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, the Trustee shall
not be liable to any holder of Senior Indebtedness if it shall
pay over or deliver to holders of Notes, the Company or any other
person money or assets to which any holder of Senior Indebtedness
shall be entitled by virtue of this Article IV or otherwise.

     Section 4.7    No Impairment of Subordination.  No right of
any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to
enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any
way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to act on the
part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good
faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company
with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture,
regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may
have or otherwise be charged with.

     Section 4.8    Certain Conversions Deemed Payment.  For the
purposes of this Article IV only, (1) the issuance and delivery
of junior securities upon conversion of Notes in accordance with
Article XV shall not be deemed to constitute a payment or
distribution on account of the principal of (or premium, if any)
or interest on Notes or on account of the purchase or other
acquisition of Notes, and (2) the payment, issuance or delivery
of cash, property or securities (other than junior securities)
upon conversion of a Note shall be deemed to constitute payment
on account of the principal of such Note.  For the purposes of
this Section 4.8, the term "junior securities" means (a) shares
of any stock of any class of the Company, or (b) securities of
the Company which are subordinated in right of payment to all
Senior Indebtedness which may be outstanding at the time of
issuance or delivery of such securities to substantially the same
extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Notes are so
subordinated as provided in this Article.  Nothing contained in
this Article IV or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Notes is
intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors
other than holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Noteholders,
the right, which is absolute and unconditional, of the Holder of
any Note to convert such Note in accordance with Article XV.

     Section 4.9    Article Applicable to Paying Agents.  If at
any time any paying agent other than the Trustee shall have been
appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term
"Trustee" as used in this Article shall (unless the context
otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and including
such paying agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and
purposes as if such paying agent were named in this Article in
addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided, however, that
the first paragraph of Section 4.5 shall not apply to the Company
or any Affiliate of the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as
paying agent.

     Section 4.10   Senior Indebtedness Entitled to Rely.  The
holders of Senior Indebtedness (including, without limitation,
Designated Senior Indebtedness) shall have the right to rely upon
this Article IV, and no amendment or modification of the
provisions contained herein shall diminish the rights of such
holders unless such holders shall have agreed in writing thereto.


                           ARTICLE V

              PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

     Section 5.1    Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
The Company covenants and agrees that it will duly and punctually
pay or cause to be paid the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on each of the Notes at the places, at the respective
times and in the manner provided herein and in the Notes.  Each
installment of interest on the Notes due on any semi-annual
interest payment date may be paid by mailing checks for the
interest payable to or upon the written order of the holders of
Notes entitled thereto as they shall appear on the registry books
of the Company; provided, that; with respect to any holder of
Notes with an aggregate principal amount equal to or in excess of
$5,000,000, at the request of such holder in writing to the
Company (who shall then furnish notice to such effect to the
Trustee), interest on such holder's Notes shall be paid by wire
transfer in immediately available funds in accordance with the
wire transfer instructions supplied by such holder to the Trustee
and paying agent (if different from the Trustee).

     Section 5.2    Maintenance of Office or Agency.  The Company
will maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York,
an office or agency where the Notes may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange or for presentation for
payment or for conversion or redemption and where notices and
demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Notes and this
Indenture may be served.  The Company will give prompt written
notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the
location, of such office or agency not designated or appointed by
the Trustee.  If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain
any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the
Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust
Office or the office or agency of the Trustee in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York.

     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more
other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to
time rescind such designations; provided that no such designation
or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its
obligation to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, for such purposes.  The Company
will give prompt written notice to any such designation or
rescission and of any change in the location of any such other
office or agency.

     The Company hereby initially designates the Trustee as
paying agent, Note registrar, Custodian and conversion agent, and
each of the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and the office
of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York
(which shall initially be State Street Bank and Trust Company,
N.A., an Affiliate of the Trustee located at 61 Broadway,
Concourse Level, Corporate Trust Window, New York, New York
10006), one such office or agency of the Company for each of the
aforesaid purposes.

     So long as the Trustee is the Note registrar, the Trustee
agrees to mail, or cause to be mailed, the notices set forth in
Section 8.10(a) and the third paragraph of Section 8.11.

     Section 5.3    Appointments to Fill Vacancies in Trustee's
Office.  The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a
vacancy in the office of Trustee, will appoint, in the manner
provided in Section 8.10, a Trustee, so that there shall at all
times be a Trustee hereunder.

     Section 5.4    Provisions as to Paying Agent.

          (a)  If the Company shall appoint a paying agent other
     than the Trustee, or if the Trustee shall appoint such a
     paying agent, it will cause such paying agent to execute and
     deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent
     shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of
     this Section 5.4:

               (1)  that it will hold all sums held by it as such
          agent for the payment of the principal of and premium,
          if any, or interest on the Notes (whether such sums
          have been paid to it by the Company or by any other
          obligor on the Notes) in trust for the benefit of the
          holders of the Notes;

               (2)  that it will give the Trustee notice of any
          failure by the Company (or by any other obligor on the
          Notes) to make any payment of the principal of and
          premium, if any, or interest on the Notes when the same
          shall be due and payable; and

               (3)  that at any time during the continuance of an
          Event of Default, upon request of the Trustee, it will
          forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust.

          The Company shall, on or before each due date of the
     principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes,
     deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay such
     principal, premium, if any, or interest, and (unless such
     paying agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly
     notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action;
     provided that if such deposit is made on the due date, such
     deposit shall be received by the paying agent by 10:00 a.m.
     New York City time, on such date.

          (b)  If the Company shall act as its own paying agent,
     it will, on or before each due date of the principal of,
     premium, if any, or interest on the Notes, set aside,
     segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the holders
     of the Notes a sum sufficient to pay such principal,
     premium, if any, or interest so becoming due and will notify
     the Trustee of any failure to take such action and of any
     failure by the Company (or any other obligor under the
     Notes) to make any payment of the principal of, premium, if
     any, or interest on the Notes when the same shall become due
     and payable.

          (c)  Anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary
     notwithstanding, the Company may, at any time, for the
     purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and discharge of this
     Indenture, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid
     to the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or any
     paying agent hereunder as required by this Section 5.4, such
     sums to be held by the Trustee upon the trusts herein
     contained and upon such payment by the Company or any paying
     agent to the Trustee, the Company or such paying agent shall
     be released from all further liability with respect to such
     sums.

          (d)  Anything in this Section 5.4 to the contrary
     notwithstanding, the agreement to hold sums in trust as
     provided in this Section 5.4 is subject to Sections 13.3 and
     13.4.

     Section 5.5    Corporate Existence.  Subject to Article XII,
the Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate
existence.

     Section 5.6    Rule 144A Information Requirement.  During
the period beginning on the latest date of the original issuance
of the Notes and ending on the date that is three years from such
date, the Company covenants and agrees that it shall, during any
period in which it is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) under
the Exchange Act, make available to any holder or beneficial
holder of Notes or any Common Stock issued upon conversion
thereof which continue to be Restricted Securities in connection
with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of Notes or
such Common Stock from such holder or beneficial holder, the
information required pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act upon the request of any holder or beneficial
holder of the Notes or such Common Stock and it will take such
further action as any holder or beneficial holder of such Notes
or such Common Stock may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such holder or beneficial
holder to sell its Notes or Common Stock without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemption
provided by Rule 144A, as such Rule may be amended from time to
time.  Upon the request of any holder or any beneficial holder of
the Notes or such Common Stock, the Company will deliver to such
holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with
such requirements.

     Section 5.7    Stay, Extension and Usury Laws.  The Company
covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it
shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner
whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay,
extension or usury law or other law which would prohibit or
forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the
principal of or interest on the Notes as contemplated herein,
wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which
may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture and
the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby
expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and
covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder,
delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the
Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such
power as though no such law has been enacted.


                           ARTICLE VI

               NOTEHOLDERS' LISTS AND REPORTS BY
                  THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE

     Section 6.1    Noteholders' Lists.  The Company covenants
and agrees that it will furnish or cause to be furnished to the
Trustee, semiannually, not more than fifteen (15) days after each
April 15 and October 15 in each year beginning with April 15,
1996, and at such other times as the Trustee may request in
writing, within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of
any such request (or such lesser time as the Trustee may
reasonably request in order to enable it to timely provide any
notice to be provided by it hereunder), a list in such form as
the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of
the holders of Notes as of a date not more than fifteen (15) days
(or such other date as the Trustee may reasonably request in
order to so provide any such notices) prior to the time such
information is furnished, except that no such list need be
furnished so long as the Trustee is acting as Note registrar.

     Section 6.2    Preservation and Disclosure of Lists.

          (a)  The Trustee shall preserve, in as current a form
     as is reasonably practicable, all information as to the
     names and addresses of the holders of Notes contained in the
     most recent list furnished to it as provided in Section 6.1
     or maintained by the Trustee in its capacity as Note
     registrar, if so acting.  The Trustee may destroy any list
     furnished to it as provided in Section 6.1 upon receipt of a
     new list so furnished.

          (b)  The rights of Noteholders to communicate with
     other holders of Notes with respect to their rights under
     this Indenture or under the Notes, and the corresponding
     rights and duties of the Trustee, shall be as provided by
     the Trust Indenture Act.

          (c)  Every Noteholder, by receiving and holding the
     same, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither
     the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of either of them
     shall be held accountable by reason of any disclosure of
     information as to names and addresses of holders of Notes
     made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.

     Section 6.3    Reports by Trustee.
          (a)  Within 60 days after May 15 of each year
     commencing with the year 1996, the Trustee shall transmit to
     holders of Notes such reports dated as of May 15 of the year
     in which such reports are made concerning the Trustee and
     its actions under this Indenture as may be required pursuant
     to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the manner
     provided pursuant thereto.

          (b)  A copy of such report shall, at the time of such
     transmission to holders of Notes, be filed by the Trustee
     with each stock exchange and automated quotation system upon
     which the Notes are listed and with the Company.  The
     Company will notify the Trustee within a reasonable time
     when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange and
     automated quotation system.

     Section 6.4    Reports by Company.  The Company shall file
with the Trustee (and the Commission if at any time after the
Indenture becomes qualified under the Trust Indenture Act), and
transmit to holders of Notes, such information, documents and
other reports and such summaries thereof, as may be required
pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act at the times and in the
manner provided pursuant to such Act; provided that any such
information, documents or reports required to be filed with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
shall be filed with the Trustee within 15 days after the same is
so required to be filed with the Commission.


                          ARTICLE VII

            REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND NOTEHOLDERS
                     ON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT

     Section 7.1    Events of Default.  In case one or more of
the following Events of Default (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary
or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of
any administrative or governmental body) shall have occurred and
be continuing:

          (a)  default in the payment of any installment of
     interest upon any of the Notes as and when the same shall
     become due and payable, and continuance of such default for
     a period of thirty (30) days, whether or not such payment is
     permitted under Article IV hereof; or

          (b)  default in the payment of the principal of and
     premium, if any, on any of the Notes as and when the same
     shall become due and payable either at maturity or in
     connection with any redemption pursuant to Article III, by
     acceleration or otherwise, whether or not such payment is
     permitted under Article IV hereof; or
          (c)  failure on the part of the Company duly to observe
     or perform any other of the covenants or agreements on the
     part of the Company in the Notes or in this Indenture (other
     than a covenant or agreement a default in whose performance
     or whose breach is elsewhere in this Section 7.1
     specifically dealt with) continued for a period of sixty
     (60) days after the date on which written notice of such
     failure, requiring the Company to remedy the same, shall
     have been given to the Company by the Trustee, or to the
     Company and a Responsible Officer of the Trustee by the
     holders of at least 25 percent in aggregate principal amount
     of the Notes at the time outstanding determined in
     accordance with Section 9.4; or

          (d)  the Company shall commence a voluntary case or
     other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization or
     other relief with respect to itself or its debts under any
     bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter
     in effect or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
     liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or any
     substantial part of its property, or shall consent to any
     such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession by
     any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding
     commenced against it, or shall make a general assignment for
     the benefit of creditors, or shall fail generally to pay its
     debts as they become due; or

          (e)  an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be
     commenced against the Company seeking liquidation,
     reorganization or other relief with respect to it or its
     debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law
     now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a
     trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar
     official of it or any substantial part of its property, and
     such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain
     undismissed and unstayed for a period of ninety (90)
     consecutive days;

then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of
Default specified in Section 7.1(d) or (e)), unless the principal
of all of the Notes shall have already become due and payable,
either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25 percent in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
hereunder determined in accordance with Section 9.4, by notice in
writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by
Noteholders), may declare the principal of all the Notes and the
interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, and
upon any such declaration the same shall become and shall be
immediately due and payable, anything in this Indenture or in the
Notes contained to the contrary notwithstanding.  If an Event of
Default specified in Section 7.1(d) or (e) occurs, the principal
of all the Notes and the interest accrued thereon shall be
immediately and automatically due and payable without necessity
of further action.  This provision, however, is subject to the
conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Notes
shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any
judgment or decree for the payment of the monies due shall have
been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, the Company
shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum sufficient to
pay all matured installments of interest upon all Notes and the
principal of and premium, if any, on any and all Notes which
shall have become due otherwise than by acceleration (with
interest on overdue installments of interest (to the extent that
payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) and
on such principal and premium, if any, at the rate borne by the
Notes, to the date of such payment or deposit) and amounts due to
the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.6, and if any and all defaults
under this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal of
and premium, if any, and accrued interest on Notes which shall
have become due by acceleration, shall have been cured or waived
pursuant to Section 7.7 -- then and in every such case the
holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the
Trustee, may waive all defaults or Events of Default and rescind
and annul such declaration and its consequences; but no such
waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to or shall
affect any subsequent default or Event of Default, or shall
impair any right consequent thereon.  The Company shall notify a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee, promptly upon becoming aware
thereof, of any Event of Default.

     In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any
right under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been
discontinued or abandoned because of such waiver or rescission
and annulment or for any other reason or shall have been
determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in every such case
the Company, the holders of Notes, and the Trustee shall be
restored respectively to their several positions and rights
hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company,
the holders of Notes, and the Trustee shall continue as though no
such proceeding had been taken.

     Section 7.2    Payments of Notes on Default: Suit Therefor.
The Company covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in
the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Notes
as and when the same shall become due and payable, and such
default shall have continued for a period of thirty (30) days, or
(b) in case default shall be made in the payment of the principal
of or premium, if any, on any of the Notes as and when the same
shall have become due and payable, whether at maturity of the
Notes or in connection with any redemption, by or under this
Indenture declaration or otherwise -- then, upon demand of the
Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of
the holders of the Notes, the whole amount that then shall have
become due and payable on all such Notes for principal and
premium, if any, or interest, or both, as the case may be, with
interest upon the overdue principal and premium, if any, and (to
the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under
applicable law) upon the overdue installments of interest at the
rate borne by the Notes; and, in addition thereto, such further
amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its
agents, attorneys and counsel, and any expenses or liabilities
incurred by the Trustee hereunder other than through its
negligence or bad faith.  Until such demand by the Trustee, the
Company may pay the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on the Notes to the registered holders, whether or not
the Notes are overdue.

     In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts
upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of
an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute
any actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection
of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action
or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any
such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other
obligor on the Notes and collect in the manner provided by law
out of the property of the Company or any other obligor on the
Notes wherever situated the monies adjudged or decreed to be
payable.

     In the case there shall be pending proceedings for the
bankruptcy or for the reorganization of the Company or any other
obligor on the Notes under Title 11 of the United States Code, or
any other applicable law, or in case a receiver, assignee or
trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator, sequestrator
or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken
possession of the Company or such other obligor, the property of
the Company or such other obligor, or in the case of any other
judicial proceedings relative to the Company or such other
obligor upon the Notes, or to the creditors or property of the
Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of
whether the principal of the Notes shall then be due and payable
as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and
irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.2, shall be entitled
and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise,
to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of
principal, premium, if any, and interest owing and unpaid in
respect of the Notes, and, in case of any judicial proceedings,
to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may
be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Trustee and of the Noteholders allowed in such judicial
proceedings relative to the Company or any other obligor on the
Notes, its or their creditors, or its or their property, and to
collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after
the deduction of any amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.6;
and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or
reorganization, liquidator, custodian or similar official is
hereby authorized by each of the Noteholders to make such
payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Noteholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for
reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements,
including counsel fees incurred by it up to the date of such
distribution.  To the extent that such payment of reasonable
compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements out of the
estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason,
payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be
paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, monies,
securities and other property which the holders of the Notes may
be entitled to receive in such proceedings, whether in
liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or
otherwise.

     All rights of action and of asserting claims under this
Indenture, or under any of the Notes, may be enforced by the
Trustee without the possession of any of the Notes, or the
production thereof on any trial or other proceeding relative
thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the
Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express
trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for
the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the Notes.

     In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any
proceedings involving the interpretation of any provision of this
Indenture to which the Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee
shall be held to represent all the holders of the Notes, and it
shall not be necessary to make any holders of the Notes parties
to any such proceedings.

     Section 7.3      Application of Monies Collected by Trustee.
Any monies collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article VII
shall be applied in the order following, at the date or dates
fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon
presentation of the several Notes, and stamping thereon the
payment, if only partially paid, and upon surrender thereof, if
fully paid:

          First:  To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee
     under Section 8.6;

          Second:  Subject to the provisions of Article IV, in
     case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall not have
     become due and be unpaid, to the payment of interest on the
     Notes in default in the order of the maturity of the
     installments of such interest, with interest (to the extent
     that such interest has been collected by the Trustee) upon
     the overdue installments of interest at the rate borne by
     the Notes, such payments to be made ratably to the persons
     entitled thereto;

          Third:  Subject to the provisions of Article IV, in
     case the principal of the outstanding Notes shall have
     become due, by declaration or otherwise, and be unpaid to
     the payment of the whole amount then owing and unpaid upon
     the Notes for principal and premium, if any, and interest,
     with interest on the overdue principal and premium, if any,
     and (to the extent that such interest has been collected by
     the Trustee) upon overdue installments of interest at the
     rate borne by the Notes; and in case such monies shall be
     insufficient to pay in full the whole amounts so due and
     unpaid upon the Notes, then to the payment of such principal
     and premium, if any, and interest without preference or
     priority of principal and premium, if any, over interest, or
     of interest over principal and premium, if any, or of any
     installment of interest over any other installment of
     interest, or of any Note over any other Note, ratably to the
     aggregate of such principal and premium, if any, and accrued
     and unpaid interest; and

          Fourth:  Subject to the provisions of Article IV, to
     the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company or any
     other person lawfully entitled thereto.

     Section 7.4    Proceedings by Noteholder.  No holder of any
Note shall have any right by virtue of or by availing of any
provision of this Indenture to institute any suit, action or
proceeding in equity or at law upon or under or with respect to
this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver, trustee,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official, or for any other
remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given
to the Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the
continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also
the holders of not less than 25 percent in aggregate principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding shall have made written
request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or
proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have
offered to the Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may
require against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be
incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for sixty (60) days
after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity,
shall have neglected or refused to institute any such action,
suit or proceeding and no direction inconsistent with such
written request shall have been given to the Trustee pursuant to
Section 7.7; it being understood and intended, and being
expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Note with
every other taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more
holders of Notes shall have any right in any manner whatever by
virtue of or by availing of any provision of this Indenture to
affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other holder of
Notes, or to obtain or seek to obtain priority over or preference
to any other such holder, or to enforce any right under this
Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the
equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Notes (except
as otherwise provided herein).  For the protection and
enforcement of this Section 7.4, each and every Noteholder and
the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given
either at law or in equity.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and
any provision of any Note, the right of any holder of any Note to
receive payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on such Note, on or after the respective due dates
expressed in such Note, or to institute suit for the enforcement
of any such payment on or after such respective dates against the
Company shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of
such holder.

     Anything in this Indenture or the Notes to the contrary
notwithstanding, the holder of any Note, without the consent of
either the Trustee or the holder of any other Note, in his own
behalf and for his own benefit, may enforce, and may institute
and maintain any proceeding suitable to enforce, his rights of
conversion as provided herein.

     Section 7.5    Proceedings by Trustee.  In case of an Event
of Default the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect
and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by
suit in equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy
or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Indenture or in aid of
the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to
enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee
by this Indenture or by law.

     Section 7.6    Remedies Cumulative and Continuing.  Except
as provided in Section 2.6, all powers and remedies given by this
Article VII to the Trustee or to the Noteholders shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be deemed cumulative and not exclusive
of any thereof or of any other powers and remedies available to
the Trustee or the holders of the Notes, by judicial proceedings
or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no
delay or omission of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the
Notes to exercise any right or power accruing upon any default or
Event of Default occurring and continuing as aforesaid shall
impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such default or any acquiescence therein; and,
subject to the provisions of Section 7.4, every power and remedy
given by this Article VII or by law to the Trustee or to the
Noteholders may be exercised from time to time, and as often as
shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Noteholders.

     Section 7.7    Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of
Defaults by Majority of Noteholders.  The holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time
outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.4 shall have
the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee; provided, however,
that (a) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of
law or with this Indenture, and (b) the Trustee may take any
other action deemed proper by the Trustee which is not
inconsistent with such direction.  The holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding
determined in accordance with Section 9.4 may on behalf of the
holders of all of the Notes waive any past default or Event of
Default hereunder and its consequences except (i) a default in
the payment of interest or premium, if any, on, or the principal
of, the Notes, (ii) a failure by the Company to convert any Notes
into Common Stock, (iii) a default in the payment of redemption
price pursuant to Article III or (iv) a default in respect of a
covenant or provisions hereof which under Article XI cannot be
modified or amended without the consent of the holders of all
Notes then outstanding. Upon any such waiver the Company, the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes shall be restored to their
former positions and rights hereunder; but no such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or
impair any right consequent thereon.  Whenever any default or
Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by
this Section 7.7, said default or Event of Default shall for all
purposes of the Notes and this Indenture be deemed to have been
cured and to be not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend
to any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

     Section 7.8    Notice of Defaults.  The Trustee shall,
within ninety (90) days after it has knowledge of the occurrence
of a default, mail to all Noteholders, as the names and addresses
of such holders appear upon the Note register, notice of all
defaults known to a Responsible Officer, unless such defaults
shall have been cured or waived before the giving of such notice;
and provided that, except in the case of default in the payment
of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any of
the Notes, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such
notice if and so long as a trust committee of directors and/or
Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that
the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the
Noteholders.

     Section 7.9    Undertaking to Pay Costs.   All parties to
this Indenture agree, and each holder of any Note by his
acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court
may, in its discretion, require, in any suit for the enforcement
of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit
against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as
Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an
undertaking to pay the costs of such suit and that such court may
in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit, having
due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses
made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions of this
Section 7.9 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to
any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any
Noteholder, or group of Noteholders, holding in the aggregate
more than ten percent in principal amount of the Notes at the
time outstanding determined in accordance with Section 9.4, or to
any suit instituted by any Noteholder for the enforcement of the
payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on
any Note on or after the due date expressed in such Note or to
any suit for the enforcement of the right to convert any Note in
accordance with the provisions of Article XV.


                          ARTICLE VIII

                     CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

     Section 8.1    Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee.  The
Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after
the curing of all Events of Default which may have occurred,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Indenture.  In case an Event of
Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived) the
Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill in
their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs.

     No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve
the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act or its own willful misconduct, except
that

          (a)  prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and
     after the curing or waiving of all Events of Default which
     may have occurred:

               (1)  the duties and obligations of the Trustee
          shall be determined solely by the express provisions of
          this Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act, and the
          Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance
          of such duties and obligations as are specifically set
          forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or
          obligations shall be read into this Indenture and the
          Trust Indenture Act against the Trustee; and

               (2)  in the absence of bad faith and willful
          misconduct on the part of the Trustee, the Trustee may
          conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements
          and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein,
          upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the
          Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this
          Indenture; but, in the case of any such certificates or
          opinions which by any provisions hereof are
          specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee,
          the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same
          to determine whether or not they conform to the
          requirements of this Indenture;

          (b)  the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of
     judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or
     Officers of the Trustee, unless the Trustee was negligent in
     ascertaining the pertinent facts;

          (c)  the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to
     any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
     in accordance with the direction of the holders of not less
     than a majority in principal amount of the Notes at the time
     outstanding determined as provided in Section 9.4 relating
     to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding
     for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any
     trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this
     Indenture; and

          (d)  whether or not therein provided, every provision
     of this Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the
     liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee shall
     be subject to the provisions of this Section.

     None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall
require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
incur personal financial liability in the performance of any of
its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if
there is reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability
is not reasonably assured to it.

     Section 8.2    Reliance on Documents, Opinions. Etc.  Except
as otherwise provided in Section 8.1:

          (a)  the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in
     acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
     instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
     order, bond, debenture, note, coupon or other paper or
     document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to
     have been signed or presented by the proper party or
     parties;

          (b)  any request, direction, order or demand of the
     Company mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by
     an Officers' Certificate (unless other evidence in respect
     thereof be herein specifically prescribed); and any
     resolution of the Board of Directors may be evidenced to the
     Trustee by a copy thereof certified by the Secretary or an
     Assistant Secretary of the Company;

          (c)  the Trustee may consult with counsel and any
     advice or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
     authorization and protection in respect of any action taken
     or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance
     with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

          (d)  the Trustee shall be under no obligation to
     exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by this
     Indenture at the request, order or direction of any of the
     Noteholders pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture,
     unless such Noteholders shall have offered to the Trustee
     reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses
     and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby;

          (e)  the Trustee shall not be bound to make any
     investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
     resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
     report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
     debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in
     its discretion, may make such further inquiry or
     investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit,
     and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further
     inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine
     the books, records and premises of the Company, personally
     or by agent or attorney; provided, however, that if the
     payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the
     costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it
     in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of
     the Trustee, not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the
     security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the
     Trustee may require reasonable indemnity against such
     expenses or liability as a condition to so proceeding; the
     reasonable expenses of every such examination shall be paid
     by the Company or, if paid by the Trustee or any predecessor
     Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company upon demand; and

          (f)  the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or
     powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either
     directly or by or through agents or attorneys and the
     Trustee shall not be responsible for any misconduct or
     negligence on the part of any agent or attorney appointed by
     it with due care hereunder.

     Section 8.3    No Responsibility for Recitals, Etc.  The
recitals contained herein and in the Notes (except in the
Trustee's certificate of authentication) shall be taken as the
statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no
responsibility for the correctness of the same.  The Trustee
makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of
this Indenture or of the Notes.  The Trustee shall not be
accountable for the use or application by the Company of any
Notes or the proceeds of any Notes authenticated and delivered by
the Trustee in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture.

     Section 8.4    Trustee, Paying Agents, Conversion Agents or
Registrar May Own Notes.  The Trustee, any paying agent, any
conversion agent or Note registrar, in its individual or any
other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Notes with the
same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, paying agent,
conversion agent or Note registrar.

     Section 8.5    Monies to Be Held in Trust.  Subject to the
provisions of Section 13.4, all monies received by the Trustee
shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust
for the purposes for which they were received.  Money held by the
Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated from other
funds except to the extent required by law.  The Trustee shall be
under no liability for interest on any money received by it
hereunder except as may be agreed from time to time by the
Company and the Trustee.

     Section 8.6    Compensation and Expenses of Trustee.  The
Company covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to
time, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, reasonable
compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder in any
capacity (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust), and
the Company will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request
for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
reasonably incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any
of the provisions of this Indenture (including the reasonable
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its counsel
and of all persons not regularly in its employ) except any such
expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its
negligence, willful misconduct, recklessness or bad faith.  The
Company also covenants to indemnify the Trustee in any capacity
under this Indenture and its agents and any authenticating agent
for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss, liability or
expense incurred without negligence, willful misconduct,
recklessness, or bad faith on the part of the Trustee or such
agent or authenticating agent, as the case may be, and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of
this trust or in any other capacity hereunder, including the
costs and expenses of defending themselves against any claim of
liability in the premises.  The obligations of the Company under
this Section 8.6 to compensate or indemnify the Trustee and to
pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses, disbursements and
advances shall be secured by a lien prior to that of the Notes
upon all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as
such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders
of particular Notes.  The obligation of the Company under this
Section shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this
Indenture.

     When the Trustee and its agents and any authenticating agent
incur expenses or render services after an Event of Default
specified in Section 7.1(d) or (e) occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services are intended to constitute expenses
of administration under any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
laws.

     Section 8.7    Officers' Certificate as Evidence.  Except as
otherwise provided in Section 8.1, whenever in the administration
of the provisions of this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it
necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established
prior to taking or omitting any action hereunder, such matter
(unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically
prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence, willful
misconduct, recklessness, or bad faith on the part of the
Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by
an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee.

     Section 8.8    Conflicting Interests of Trustee.  If the
Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the
meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either
eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the
manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust
Indenture Act and this Indenture.

     Section 8.9    Eligibility of Trustee.  There shall at all
times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a Person that is
eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and
has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000.  If
such person publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of any supervising or
examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the
combined capital and surplus of such person shall be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published.  If at any time the Trustee
shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of
this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with
the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

     Section 8.10   Resignation or Removal of Trustee.

          (a)  The Trustee may at any time resign by giving
     written notice of such resignation to the Company and to the
     holders of Notes.  Upon receiving such notice of
     resignation, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor
     trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by
     order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which
     instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and
     one copy to the successor trustee.  If no successor trustee
     shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment
     sixty (60) days after the mailing of such notice of
     resignation to the Noteholders, the resigning Trustee may
     petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
     appointment of a successor trustee, or any Noteholder who
     has been a bona fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least
     six months may, subject to the provisions of Section 7.9, on
     behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
     petition any such court for the appointment of a successor
     trustee.  Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if
     any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a
     successor trustee.

          (b)  In case at any time any of the following shall
     occur:

               (1)  the Trustee shall fail to comply with
          Section 8.8 after written request therefor by the
          Company or by any Noteholder who has been a bona fide
          holder of a Note or Notes for at least six months; or

               (2)  the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
          accordance with the provisions of Section 8.9 and shall
          fail to resign after written request therefor by the
          Company or by any such Noteholder; or

               (3)  the Trustee shall become incapable of acting,
          or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a
          receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be
          appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or
          control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs
          for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
          liquidation;

     then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee
     and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in
     duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one
     copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee
     so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or,
     subject to the provisions of Section 7.9, any Noteholder who
     has been a bona fide holder of a Note or Notes for at least
     six months may, on behalf of himself and all others
     similarly situated, petition any court of competent
     jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the
     appointment of a successor trustee.  Such court may
     thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper
     and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor
     trustee.

          (c)  The holders of a majority in aggregate principal
     amount of the Notes at the time outstanding may at any time
     remove the Trustee and nominate a successor trustee which
     shall be deemed appointed as successor trustee unless within
     ten (10) days after notice to the Company of such nomination
     the Company objects thereto, in which case the Trustee so
     removed or any Noteholder, upon the terms and conditions and
     otherwise as in Section 8.10(a) provided, may petition any
     court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a
     successor trustee.
          (d)  Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and
     appointment of a successor trustee pursuant to any of the
     provisions of this Section 8.10 shall become effective upon
     acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as
     provided in Section 8.11.

     Section 8.11   Acceptance by Successor Trustee.  Any
successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 8.10 shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to its
predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment
hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor
trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations
of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally
named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the written
request of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee
ceasing to act shall, upon payment of any amounts then due it
pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.6, execute and deliver an
instrument transferring to such successor trustee all the rights
and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act.  Upon request of any
such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all
instruments in writing for more fully and certainly vesting in
and confirming to such successor trustee all such rights and
powers.  Any trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a
lien upon all property and funds held or collected by such
trustee as such, except for funds held in trust for the benefit
of holders of particular Notes, to secure any amounts then due it
pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.6.

     No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in
this Section 8.11 unless at the time of such acceptance such
successor trustee shall be qualified under the provisions of
Section 8.8 and be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.9.

     Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as
provided in this Section 8.11, each of the Company and the former
trustee shall mail or cause to be mailed notice of the succession
of such trustee hereunder to the holders of Notes at their
addresses as they shall appear on the Note register.  If the
Company fails to mail such notice within ten (10) days after
acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee, the successor
trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of
the Company.

     Section 8.12   Succession by Merger, Etc.  Any corporation
into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with which
it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be
a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or substantially
all of the trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor
to the Trustee hereunder without the execution or filing of any
paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto, provided that in the case of any corporation succeeding
to all or substantially all of the trust business of the Trustee
such corporation shall be qualified under the provisions of
Section 8.8 and eligible under the provisions of Section 8.9.

     In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall
succeed to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Notes
shall have been authenticated but not delivered, any such
successor to the Trustee may adopt the certificate of
authentication of any predecessor trustee or authenticating agent
appointed by such predecessor trustee, and deliver such Notes so
authenticated; and in case at that time any of the Notes shall
not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee or an
authenticating agent appointed by such successor trustee may
authenticate such Notes either in the name of any predecessor
trustee hereunder or in the name of the successor trustee; and in
all such cases such certificates shall have the full force which
it is anywhere in the Notes or in this Indenture provided that
the certificate of the Trustee shall have; provided, however,
that the right to adopt the certificate of authentication of any
predecessor Trustee or authenticate Notes in the name of any
predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its successor or
successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

     Section 8.13   Limitation on Rights of Trustee as Creditor.
If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the
Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes), the Trustee shall
be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding
the collection of the claims against the Company (or any such
other obligor).


                           ARTICLE IX

                   CONCERNING THE NOTEHOLDERS

     Section 9.1    Action by Noteholders.  Whenever in this
Indenture it is provided that the holders of a specified
percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Notes may take
any action (including the making of any demand or request, the
giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any
other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such
action, the holders of such specified percentage have joined
therein may be evidenced (a) by any instrument or any number of
instruments of similar tenor executed by Noteholders in person or
by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by the record of
the holders of Notes voting in favor thereof at any meeting of
Noteholders duly called and held in accordance with the
provisions of Article X, or (c) by a combination of such
instrument or instruments and any such record of such a meeting
of Noteholders.  Whenever the Company or the Trustee solicits the
taking of any action by the holders of the Notes, the Company or
the Trustee may fix in advance of such solicitation, a date as
the record date for determining holders entitled to take such
action.  The record date shall be not more than fifteen (15) days
prior to the date of commencement of solicitation of such action.

     Section 9.2    Proof of Execution by Noteholders.  Subject
to the provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.2 and 10.5, proof of the
execution of any instrument by a Noteholder or his agent or proxy
shall be sufficient if made in accordance with such reasonable
rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the Trustee or in
such manner as shall be satisfactory to the Trustee.  The holding
of Notes shall be proved by the registry of such Notes or by a
certificate of the Note registrar.

     The record of any Noteholders' meeting shall be proved in
the manner provided in Section 10.6.

     Section 9.3    Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners.  The Company,
the Trustee, any paying agent, any conversion agent and any Note
registrar may deem the person in whose name such Note shall be
registered upon the Note register to be, and may treat him as,
the absolute owner of such Note (whether or not such Note shall
be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other
writing thereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on
account of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
such Note, for conversion of such Note and for all other
purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying
agent nor any conversion agent nor any Note registrar shall be
affected by any notice to the contrary.  All such payments so
made to any holder for the time being, or upon his order, shall
be valid, and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid,
effectual to satisfy and discharge the liability for monies
payable upon any such Note.

     Section 9.4    Company-Owned Notes Disregarded.  In
determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate
principal amount of Notes have concurred in any direction,
consent, waiver or other action under this Indenture, Notes which
are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Notes or by
any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or
under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any
other obligor on the Notes shall be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding for the purpose of any such determination;
provided that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee
shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent,
waiver or other action only Notes which a Responsible Officer
knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.  Notes so owned which
have been pledged in good faith may be regarded as outstanding
for the purposes of this Section 9.4 if the pledgee shall
establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's right
to vote such Notes and that the pledgee is not the Company, any
other obligor on the Notes or a person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common
control with the Company or any such other obligor.  In the case
of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken
upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the
Trustee.  Upon request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish
to the Trustee promptly an Officers' Certificate listing and
identifying all Notes, if any, known by the Company to be owned
or held by or for the account of any of the above described
persons; and, subject to Section 8.1, the Trustee shall be
entitled to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive
evidence of the facts therein set forth and of the fact that all
Notes not listed therein are outstanding for the purpose of any
such determination.

     Section 9.5    Revocation of Consents: Future Holders Bound.
At any time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the
Trustee, as provided in Section 9.1, of the taking of any action
by the holders of the percentage in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes specified in this Indenture in connection with such
action, any holder of a Note which is shown by the evidence to be
included in the Notes the holders of which have consented to such
action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in
Section 9.2, revoke such action so far as concerns such Note.
Except as aforesaid, any such action taken by the holder of any
Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon
all future holders and owners of such Note and of any Notes
issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of
whether any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Note or
any Note issued in exchange or substitution therefor.


                           ARTICLE X

In case at any time the Company, pursuant to a resolution of its

have requested the Trustee to call a meeting of Noteholders, by
written request setting forth in reasonable detail the action
proposed to be taken at the meeting, and the Trustee shall not

                           ARTICLE XI

                    SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES

     Section 11.1   Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of
Noteholders.  The Company, when authorized by the resolutions of
the Board of Directors, and the Trustee may from time to time and
at any time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental
hereto for one or more of the following purposes:

          (a)  to make provision with respect to the conversion
     rights of the holders of Notes pursuant to the requirements
     of Section 15.6;

          (b)  subject to Article IV, to convey, transfer,
     assign, mortgage or pledge to the Trustee as security for
     the Notes, any property or assets;

          (c)  to evidence the succession of another corporation
     to the Company, or successive successions, and the
     assumption by the successor corporation of the covenants,
     agreements and obligations of the Company pursuant to
     Article XII;

          (d)  to add to the covenants of the Company such
     further covenants, restrictions or conditions as the Board
     of Directors and the Trustee shall consider to be for the
     benefit of the holders of Notes, and to make the occurrence,
     or the occurrence and continuance, of a default in any such
     additional covenants, restrictions or conditions a default
     or an Event of Default permitting the enforcement of all or
     any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as
     herein set forth; provided, however, that in respect of any
     such additional covenant, restriction or condition such
     supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period
     of grace after default (which period may be shorter or
     longer than that allowed in the case of other defaults) or
     may provide for an immediate enforcement upon such default
     or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such
     default;

          (e)  to provide for the issuance under this Indenture
     of Notes in coupon form (including Notes registrable as to
     principal only) and to provide for exchangeability of such
     Notes with the Notes issued hereunder in fully registered
     form and to make all appropriate changes for such purpose;

          (f)  to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement
     any provision contained herein or in any supplemental
     indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any
     other provision contained herein or in any supplemental
     indenture, or to make such other provisions in regard to
     matters or questions arising under this Indenture which
     shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the
     holders of the Notes;

          (g)  to evidence and provide for the acceptance of
     appointment hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to
     the Notes; or

          (h)  to modify, eliminate or add to the provisions of
     this Indenture to such extent as shall be necessary to
     effect the qualifications of this Indenture under the Trust
     Indenture Act, or under any similar federal statute
     hereafter enacted.

     The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in
the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any
further appropriate agreements and stipulations which may be
therein contained and to accept the conveyance, transfer and
assignment of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not
be obligated to, but may in its discretion, enter into any
supplemental indenture which affects the Trustee's own rights,
duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

     Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of
this Section 11.1 may be executed by the Company and the Trustee
without the consent of the holders of any of the Notes at the
time outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of
Section 11.2.

     Section 11.2   Supplemental Indentures with Consent of
Noteholders.  With the consent (evidenced as provided in
Article IX) of the holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes at the time outstanding,
the Company, when authorized by the resolutions of the Board of
Directors, and the Trustee may from time to time and at any time
enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or
eliminating any of the provisions of this Indenture or any
supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights
of the holders of the Notes; provided, however, that no such
supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the fixed maturity of any
Note, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of
interest thereon, or reduce the principal amount thereof or
premium, if any, thereon, or reduce any amount payable on
redemption thereof, or impair the right of any Noteholder to
institute suit for the payment thereof, or make the principal
thereof or interest or premium, if any, thereon payable in any
coin or currency other than that provided in the Notes, or modify
the provisions of this Indenture with respect to the
subordination of the Notes in a manner adverse to the Noteholders
in any material respect, or change the obligation of the Company
to redeem any Note upon the happening of a Fundamental Change in
a manner adverse to the holder of Notes, or impair the right to
convert the Notes into Common Stock subject to the terms set
forth herein, including Section 15.6, without the consent of the
holder of each Note so affected, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid
percentage of Notes, the holders of which are required to consent
to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the
holders of all Notes then outstanding.

     Upon the request of the Company, accompanied by a copy of
the resolutions of the Board of Directors certified by its
Secretary or Assistant Secretary authorizing the execution of any
such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee
of evidence of the consent of Noteholders as aforesaid, the
Trustee shall join with the Company in the execution of such
supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects
the Trustee's own rights, duties or immunities under this
Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in is
discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter into such
supplemental indenture.

     It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Noteholders
under this Section 11.2 to approve the particular form of any
proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if
such consent shall approve the substance thereof.

     Section 11.3   Effect of Supplemental Indenture.  Any
supplemental indenture executed pursuant to the provisions of
this Article XI shall comply with the Trust Indenture Act, as
then in effect; provided that this Section 11.3 shall not require
such supplemental indenture or the Trustee to be qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act prior to the time such qualification is
in fact required under the terms of the Trust Indenture Act or
the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act,
nor shall it constitute any admission or acknowledgment by any
party to such supplemental indenture that any such qualification
is required prior to the time such qualification is in fact
required under the terms of the Trust Indenture Act or the
Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act.  Upon
the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the
provisions of this Article XI, this Indenture shall be and be
deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the
respective rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company and
the holders of Notes shall thereafter be determined, exercised
and enforced hereunder subject in all respects to such
modifications and amendments and all the terms and conditions of
any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be part
of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all
purposes.

     Section 11.4   Notation on Notes.  Notes authenticated and
delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture
pursuant to the provisions of this Article XI may bear a notation
in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter provided for in
such supplemental indenture.  If the Company or the Trustee shall
so determine, new Notes so modified as to conform, in the opinion
of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any modification of
this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may,
at the Company's expense, be prepared and executed by the
Company, authenticated by the Trustee (or an authenticating agent
duly appointed by the Trustee pursuant to Section 16.11) and
delivered in exchange for the Notes then outstanding, upon
surrender of such Notes then outstanding.

     Section 11.5   Evidence of Compliance of Supplemental
Indenture to Be Furnished Trustee.  The Trustee, subject to the
provisions of Sections 8.1 and 8.2, may receive an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that
any supplemental indenture executed pursuant hereto complies with
the requirements of this Article XI.


                          ARTICLE XII

       CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE, CONVEYANCE AND LEASE

     Section 12.1   Company May Consolidate Etc. on Certain
Terms.  Subject to the provisions of Section 12.2, nothing
contained in this Indenture or in any of the Notes shall prevent
any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into any other
corporation or corporations (whether or not affiliated with the
Company), or successive consolidations or mergers in which the
Company or its successor or successors shall be a party or
parties, or shall prevent any sale, conveyance or lease (or
successive sales, conveyances or leases) of all or substantially
all of the property of the Company, to any other corporation
(whether or not affiliated with the Company), authorized to
acquire and operate the same and which shall be organized under
the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof or
the District of Columbia; provided, that upon any such
consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease, the due and
punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest on all of the Notes, according to their tenor, and the
due and punctual performance and observance of all of the
covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by the
Company, shall be expressly assumed, by supplemental indenture
satisfactory in form to the Trustee, executed and delivered to
the Trustee by the corporation (if other than the Company) formed
by such consolidation, or into which the Company shall have been
merged, or by the corporation which shall have acquired or leased
such property, and such supplemental indenture shall provide for
the applicable conversion rights set forth in Section 15.6.

     Section 12.2   Successor Corporation to Be Substituted.  In
case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or lease
and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and
satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the due and punctual
payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on
all of the Notes and the due and punctual performance of all of
the covenants and conditions of this Indenture to be performed by
the Company, such successor corporation shall succeed to and be
substituted for the Company, with the same effect as if it had
been named herein as the party of the first part.  Such successor
corporation thereupon may cause to be signed, and may issue
either in its own name or in the name of Xilinx, Inc. any or all
of the Notes issuable hereunder which theretofore shall not have
been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and,
upon the order of such successor corporation instead of the
Company and subject to all the terms, conditions and limitations
in this Indenture prescribed, the Trustee shall authenticate and
shall deliver, or cause to be authenticated and delivered, any
Notes which previously shall have been signed and delivered by
the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication,
and any Notes which such successor corporation thereafter shall
cause to be signed and delivered to the Trustee for that purpose.
All the Notes so issued shall in all respects have the same legal
rank and benefit under this Indenture as the Notes theretofore or
thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture
as though all of such Notes had been issued at the date of the
execution hereof.  In the event of any such consolidation,
merger, sale, conveyance or lease, the person named as the
"Company" in the first paragraph of this Indenture or any
successor which shall thereafter have become such in the manner
prescribed in this Article XII may be dissolved, wound up and
liquidated at any time thereafter and such person shall be
released from its liabilities as obligor and maker of the Notes
and from its obligations under this Indenture.

     In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance
or lease, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in
substance) may be made in the Notes thereafter to be issued as
may be appropriate.

     Section 12.3   Opinion of Counsel to Be Given Trustee.  The
Trustee, subject to Sections 8.1 and 8.2, shall receive an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive
evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance or
lease and any such assumption complies with the provisions of
this Article XII.


                          ARTICLE XIII

            SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF INDENTURE

     Section 13.1   Discharge of Indenture.  When (a) the Company
shall deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Notes
theretofore authenticated (other than any Notes which have been
destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for
which other Notes shall have been authenticated and delivered)
and not theretofore canceled, or (b) all the Notes not
theretofore canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation
shall have become due and payable, or are by their terms to
become due and payable within one year or are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption, and the Company
shall deposit with the Trustee, in trust, funds sufficient to pay
at maturity or upon redemption of all of the Notes (other than
any Notes which shall have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen and in lieu of or in substitution for which other Notes
shall have been authenticated and delivered) not theretofore
canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including
principal and premium, if any, and interest due or to become due
to such date of maturity or redemption date, as the case may be,
and if in either case the Company shall also pay or cause to be
paid all other sums payable hereunder by the Company, then this
Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as to (i)
remaining rights of registration of transfer, substitution and
exchange and conversion of Notes, (ii) rights hereunder of
Noteholders to receive payments of principal of and premium, if
any, and interest on, the Notes and the other rights, duties and
obligations of Noteholders, as beneficiaries hereof with respect
to the amounts, if any, so deposited with the Trustee and (iii)
the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee hereunder),
and the Trustee, on demand of the Company accompanied by an
Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as required by
Section 16.5 and at the cost and expense of the Company, shall
execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and
discharging this Indenture; the Company, however, hereby agreeing
to reimburse the Trustee for any costs or expenses thereafter
reasonably and properly incurred by the Trustee and to compensate
the Trustee for any services thereafter reasonably and properly
rendered by the Trustee in connection with this Indenture or the
Notes.

     Section 13.2   Deposited Monies to Be Held in Trust by
Trustee.  Subject to Section 13.4, all monies deposited with the
Trustee pursuant to Section 13.1 and not in violation of Article
IV shall be held in trust for the sole benefit of the Noteholders
and not to be subject to the subordination provisions of Article
IV, and such monies shall be applied by the Trustee to the
payment, either directly or through any paying agent (including
the Company if acting as its own paying agent), to the holders of
the particular Notes for the payment or redemption of which such
monies have been deposited with the Trustee, of all sums due and
to become due thereon for principal and interest and premium, if
any.

     Section 13.3   Paying Agent to Repay Monies Held.  Upon the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, all monies then
held by any paying agent of the Notes (other than the Trustee)
shall, upon written request of the Company, be repaid to it or
paid to the Trustee, and thereupon such paying agent shall be
released from all further liability with respect to such monies.

     Section 13.4   Return of Unclaimed Monies.  Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, any monies deposited with or paid
to the Trustee for payment of the principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on Notes and not applied but remaining unclaimed by
the holders of Notes for two years after the date upon which the
principal of, premium, if any, or interest on such Notes, as the
case may be, shall have become due and payable, shall be repaid
to the Company by the Trustee on demand and all liability of the
Trustee shall thereupon cease with respect to such monies; and
the holder of any of the Notes shall thereafter look only to the
Company for any payment which such holder may be entitled to
collect unless an applicable abandoned property law designates
another Person.

     Section 13.5   Reinstatement.  If the Trustee or the paying
agent is unable to apply any money in accordance with
Section 13.2 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting such application, the Company's obligations under
this Indenture and the Notes shall be revived and reinstated as
though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 13.1 until
such time as the Trustee or the paying agent is permitted to
apply all such money in accordance with Section 13.2; provided,
however,  that if the Company makes any payment of interest on or
principal of any Note following the reinstatement of its
obligations, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the
holders of such Notes to receive such payment from the money held
by the Trustee or paying agent.


                          ARTICLE XIV

            IMMUNITY OF INCORPORATORS, STOCKHOLDERS,
                     OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

Obligations.  No recourse for the payment of the principal of or
premium, if any, or interest on any Note, or for any claim based
thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and no recourse under or
upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company in this
Indenture or in any supplemental indenture or in any Note, or
because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby,
shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, employee,
agent, officer, or director or subsidiary, as such, past, present
or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either
directly or through the Company or any successor corporation,
whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or
by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise; it
being expressly understood that all such liability is hereby
expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a
consideration for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue
of the Notes.


                           ARTICLE XV

                      CONVERSION OF NOTES

     Section 15.1   Right to Convert.  Subject to and upon
compliance with the provisions of this Indenture, the holder of
any Note shall have the right, at his option, at any time after
sixty (60) days following the latest date of original issuance of
the Notes and prior to the close of business on November 1, 2002
(except that, with respect to any Note or portion of a Note which
shall be called for redemption, such right shall terminate,
except as provided in Section 15.2 or Section 3.4, at the close
of business on the Business Day next preceding the date fixed for
redemption of such Note or portion of a Note unless the Company
shall default in payment due upon redemption thereof) to convert
the principal amount of any such Note, or any portion of such
principal amount which is $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof,
into that number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of
Common Stock (as such shares shall then be constituted) obtained
by dividing the principal amount of the Note or portion thereof
surrendered for conversion by the Conversion Price in effect at
such time, by surrender of the Note so to be converted in whole
or in part in the manner provided, together with any required
funds, in Section 15.2. A holder of Notes is not entitled to any
rights of a holder of Common Stock until such holder has
converted his Notes to Common Stock, and only to the extent such
Notes are deemed to have been converted to Common Stock under
this Article XV.

     Section 15.2   Exercise of Conversion Privilege; Issuance of
Common Stock on Conversion; No Adjustment for Interest or
Dividends.  In order to exercise the conversion privilege with
respect to any Note in definitive form, the holder of any such
Note to be converted in whole or in part shall surrender such
Note, duly endorsed, at an office or agency maintained by the
Company pursuant to Section 5.2, accompanied by the funds, if
any, required by the penultimate paragraph of this Section 15.2,
and shall give written notice of conversion in the form provided
on the Notes (or such other notice which is acceptable to the
Company) to the office or agency that the holder elects to
convert such Note or the portion thereof specified in said
notice.  Such notice shall also state the name or names (with
address or addresses) in which the certificate or certificates
for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable on such
conversion shall be issued, and shall be accompanied by transfer
taxes, if required pursuant to Section 15.7.  Each such Note
surrendered for conversion shall, unless the shares issuable on
conversion are to be issued in the same name as the registration
of such Note, be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company duly
executed by, the holder or his duly authorized attorney.

     In order to exercise the conversion privilege with respect
to any interest in a Note in global form, the beneficial holder
must complete the appropriate instruction form for conversion
pursuant to the Depository's book-entry conversion program,
deliver by book-entry delivery an interest in such Note in global
form, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if
required by the Company or the Trustee or conversion agent, and
pay the funds, if any, required by this Section 15.2 and any
transfer taxes if required pursuant to Section 15.7.

     As promptly as practicable after satisfaction of the
requirements for conversion set forth above, subject to
compliance with any restrictions on transfer if shares issuable
on conversion are to be issued in a name other than that of the
Noteholder (as if such transfer were a transfer of the Note or
Notes (or portion thereof) so converted), the Company shall issue
and shall deliver to such holder at the office or agency
maintained by the Company for such purpose pursuant to
Section 5.2, a certificate or certificates for the number of full
shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such Note
or portion thereof in accordance with the provisions of this
Article and a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest
in respect of a share of Common Stock arising upon such
conversion, as provided in Section 15.3.  In case any Note of a
denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial
conversion, and subject to Section 2.3, the Company shall execute
and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the holder of
the Note so surrendered, without charge to him, a new Note or
Notes in authorized denominations in an aggregate principal
amount equal to the unconverted portion of the surrendered Note.

     Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to
any such Note (or portion thereof) on the date on which the
requirements set forth above in this Section 15.2 have been
satisfied as to such Note (or portion thereof), and the person in
whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of Common
Stock shall be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to
have become on said date the holder of record of the shares
represented thereby; provided, however, that any such surrender
on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed shall constitute the person in whose name the certificates
are to be issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes on
the next succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are
open, but such conversion shall be at the Conversion Price in
effect on the date upon which such Note shall be surrendered.

     Any Note or portion thereof surrendered for conversion
during the period from the close of business on the record date
for any interest payment date to the close of business on the
Business Day next preceding the following interest payment date
shall (unless such Note or portion thereof being converted shall
have been called for redemption during the period from the close
of business on such record date to the close of business on the
Business Day next preceding the following interest payment date)
be accompanied by payment, in New York Clearing House funds or
other funds acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the
interest otherwise payable on such interest payment date on the
principal amount being converted; provided, however, that no such
payment need be made if there shall exist at the time of
conversion a default in the payment of interest on the Notes.
Except as provided above in this Section 15.2, no adjustment
shall be made for interest accrued on any Note converted or for
dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of such Note
as provided in this Article.

     Upon the conversion of an interest in a Note in global form,
the Trustee, or the Custodian at the direction of the Trustee,
shall make a notation on such Note in global form as to the
reduction in the principal amount represented thereby.

     Section 15.3   Cash Payments in Lieu of Fractional Shares.
No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip representing
fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of Notes.  If
more than one Note shall be surrendered for conversion at one
time by the same holder, the number of full shares which shall be
issuable upon conversion shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes (or specified portions
thereof to the extent permitted hereby) so surrendered.  If any
fractional share of stock would be issuable upon the conversion
of any Note or Notes, the Company shall make an adjustment and
payment therefor in cash at the current market value thereof to
the holder of Notes.  The current market value of a share of
Common Stock shall be the Closing Price on the first Business Day
immediately preceding the day on which the Notes (or specified
portions thereof) are deemed to have been converted.

     Section 15.4   Conversion Price.  The conversion price shall
be as specified in the form of Note (herein called the
"Conversion Price") attached as Exhibit A hereto, subject to
adjustment as provided in this Article XV.

     Section 15.5   Adjustment of Conversion Price.  The
Conversion Price shall be adjusted from time to time by the
Company as follows:

          (a)  In case the Company shall hereafter pay a dividend
     or make a distribution to all holders of the outstanding
     Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price
     in effect at the opening of business on the date following
     the date fixed for the determination of stockholders
     entitled to receive such dividend or other distribution
     shall be reduced by multiplying such Conversion Price by a
     fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of
     shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business
     on the date fixed for such determination and the denominator
     shall be the sum of such number of shares and the total
     number of shares constituting such dividend or other
     distribution, such reduction to become effective immediately
     after the opening of business on the day following the date
     fixed for such determination.  The Company will not pay any
     dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock
     held in the treasury of the Company.  If any dividend or
     distribution of the type described in this Section 15.5(a)
     is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion Price
     shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would
     then be in effect if such dividend or distribution had not
     been declared.

          (b)  In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants
     to all holders of its outstanding shares of Common Stock
     entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after
     the date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to
     receive such rights or warrants) to subscribe for or
     purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share less
     than the Current Market Price (as defined below) on the date
     fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive
     such rights or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be
     adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined
     by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately
     prior to the date fixed for determination of stockholders
     entitled to receive such rights or warrants by a fraction of
     which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding at the close of business on the date fixed
     for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
     rights and warrants plus the number of shares which the
     aggregate offering price of the total number of shares so
     offered would purchase at such Current Market Price, and of
     which the denominator shall be the number of shares of
     Common Stock outstanding on the date fixed for determination
     of stockholders entitled to receive such rights and warrants
     plus the total number of additional shares of Common Stock
     offered for subscription or purchase.  Such adjustment shall
     be successively made whenever any such rights and warrants
     are issued, and shall become effective immediately after the
     opening of business on the day following the date fixed for
     determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
     rights or warrants.  To the extent that shares of Common
     Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights
     or warrants, the Conversion Price shall be readjusted to the
     Conversion Price which would then be in effect had the
     adjustments made upon the issuance of such rights or
     warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the
     number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered.  In the
     event that such rights or warrants are not so issued, the
     Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the
     Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such date
     fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to
     receive such rights or warrants had not been fixed.  In
     determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the
     holders to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock
     at less than such Current Market Price, and in determining
     the aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock,
     there shall be taken into account any consideration received
     by the Company for such rights or warrants, the value of
     such consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by
     the Board of Directors.

          (c)  In case outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
     be subdivided into a greater number of shares of Common
     Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at the opening of
     business on the day following the day upon which such
     subdivision becomes effective shall be proportionately
     reduced, and conversely, in case outstanding shares of
     Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of
     shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price in effect at
     the opening of business on the day following the day upon
     which such combination becomes effective shall be
     proportionately increased, such reduction or increase, as
     the case may be, to become effective immediately after the
     opening of business on the day following the day upon which
     such subdivision or combination becomes effective.

          (d)  In case the Company shall, by dividend or
     otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock
     shares of any class of capital stock of the Company (other
     than any dividends or distributions to which Section 15.5(a)
     applies) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets
     (including securities, but excluding any rights or warrants
     referred to in Section 15.5(b), and excluding any dividend
     or distribution (x) in connection with the liquidation,
     dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary
     or involuntary, (y) paid exclusively in cash or (z) referred
     to in Section 15.5(a) (any of the foregoing hereinafter in
     this Section 15.5(d) called the "Securities")), then, in
     each such case (unless the Company elects to reserve such
     Securities for distribution to the Noteholders upon the
     conversion of the Notes so that any such holder converting
     Notes will receive upon such conversion, in addition to the
     shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled, the
     amount and kind of such Securities which such holder would
     have received if such holder had converted its Notes into
     Common Stock immediately prior to the Record Date (as
     defined in Section 15.5(h) for such distribution of the
     Securities)), the Conversion Price shall be reduced so that
     the same shall be equal to the price determined by
     multiplying the Conversion Price in effect on the Record
     Date with respect to such distribution by a fraction of
     which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per
     share of the Common Stock on such Record Date less the fair
     market value (as determined by the Board of Directors, whose
     determination shall be conclusive, and described in a
     resolution of the Board of Directors) on the Record Date of
     the portion of the Securities so distributed applicable to
     one share of Common Stock and the denominator shall be the
     Current Market Price per share of the Common Stock, such
     reduction to become effective immediately prior to the
     opening of business on the day following such Record Date;
     provided, however, that in the event the then fair market
     value (as so determined) of the portion of the Securities so
     distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal
     to or greater than the Current Market Price of the Common
     Stock on the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing
     adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each
     Noteholder shall have the right to receive upon conversion
     the amount of Securities such holder would have received had
     such holder converted each Note on the Record Date.  In the
     event that such dividend or distribution is not so paid or
     made, the Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the
     Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such
     dividend or distribution had not been declared.  If the
     Board of Directors determines the fair market value of any
     distribution for purposes of this Section 15.5(d) by
     reference to the actual or when issued trading market for
     any securities, it must in doing so consider the prices in
     such market over the same period used in computing the
     Current Market Price of the Common Stock.

          Each share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
     Notes pursuant to this Article XV shall be entitled to
     receive the appropriate number of Rights, if any, and the
     certificates representing the Common Stock issued upon such
     conversion shall bear such legends, if any, in each case as
     provided by and subject to the terms of the Rights Agreement
     as in effect at the time of such conversion.  If the Rights
     are separated from the Common Stock in accordance with the
     provisions of the Rights Agreement such that the holders of
     Notes would thereafter not be entitled to receive any such
     Rights in respect to the Common Stock issuable upon
     conversion of such Notes, the Conversion Price will be
     adjusted as provided in this Section 15.5(d) on the
     separation date; provided that if such Rights expire,
     terminate or are redeemed by the Company, the Conversion
     Price shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Price
     which would then be in effect if such separation had not
     occurred.  In lieu of any such adjustment, the Company may
     amend the Rights Agreement to provide that upon conversion
     of the Notes the holders will receive, in addition to the
     Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the Rights which
     would have attached to such shares of Common Stock if the
     Rights had not become separated from the Common Stock
     pursuant to the provisions of the Rights Agreement.

          Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all
     holders of Common Stock entitling the holders thereof to
     subscribe for or purchase shares of the Company's capital
     stock (either initially or under certain circumstances),
     which rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a
     specified event or events ("Trigger Event"): (i) are deemed
     to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock; (ii) are
     not exercisable; and (iii) are also issued in respect of
     future issuances of Common Stock, shall be deemed not to
     have been distributed for purposes of this Section 15.5 (and
     no adjustment to the Conversion Price under this
     Section 15.5 will be required) until the occurrence of the
     earliest Trigger Event, whereupon such rights and warrants
     shall be deemed to have been distributed and an appropriate
     adjustment (if any is required) to the Conversion Price
     shall be made under this Section 15.5(d).  If any such right
     or warrant, including any such existing rights or warrants
     distributed prior to the date of this Indenture, are subject
     to events, upon the occurrence of which such rights or
     warrants become exercisable to purchase different
     securities, evidences of indebtedness or other assets, then
     the date of the occurrence of any and each such event shall
     be deemed to be the date of distribution and record date
     with respect to new rights or warrants with such rights (and
     a termination or expiration of the existing rights or
     warrants without exercise by any of the holders thereof).
     In addition, in the event of any distribution (or deemed
     distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger Event or
     other event (of the type described in the preceding
     sentence) with respect thereto that was counted for purposes
     of calculating a distribution amount for which an adjustment
     to the Conversion Price under this Section 15.5 was made,
     (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants which shall
     all have been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by
     any holders thereof, the Conversion Price shall be
     readjusted upon such final redemption or repurchase to give
     effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the case
     may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the
     per share redemption or repurchase price received by a
     holder or holders of Common Stock with respect to such
     rights or warrants (assuming such holder had retained such
     rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as
     of the date of such redemption or repurchase, and (2) in the
     case of such rights or warrants which shall have expired or
     been terminated without exercise by any holders thereof, the
     Conversion Price shall be readjusted as if such rights and
     warrants had not been issued.

          For purposes of this Section 15.5(d) and
     Sections 15.5(a) and (b), any dividend or distribution to
     which this Section 15.5(d) is applicable that also includes
     shares of Common Stock, or rights or warrants to subscribe
     for or purchase shares of Common Stock (or both), shall be
     deemed instead to be (1) a dividend or distribution of the
     evidences of indebtedness, assets or shares of capital stock
     other than such shares of Common Stock or rights or warrants
     (and any Conversion Price reduction required by this
     Section 15.5(d) with respect to such dividend or
     distribution shall then be made) immediately followed by (2)
     a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock or
     such rights or warrants (and any further Conversion Price
     reduction required by Sections 15.5(a) and (b) with respect
     to such dividend or distribution shall then be made), except
     (A) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall
     be substituted as "the date fixed for the determination of
     stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other
     distribution" and "the date fixed for such determination"
     within the meaning of Sections 15.5(a) and (b) and (B) any
     shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or
     distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close
     of business on the date fixed for such determination" within
     the meaning of Section 15.5(a).

          (e)  In case the Company shall, by dividend or
     otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock
     cash (excluding (x) any quarterly cash dividend on the
     Common Stock to the extent the aggregate cash dividend per
     share of Common Stock in any fiscal quarter does not exceed
     the greater of (A) the amount per share of Common Stock of
     the next preceding quarterly cash dividend on the Common
     Stock to the extent that such preceding quarterly dividend
     did not require any adjustment of the Conversion Price
     pursuant to this Section 15.5(e) (as adjusted to reflect
     subdivisions or combinations of the Common Stock), and (B)
     3.75% of the arithmetic average of the Closing Price
     (determined as set forth in Section 15.5(h)) during the ten
     Trading Days (as defined in Section 15.5(h)) immediately
     prior to the date of declaration of such dividend, and (y)
     any dividend or distribution in connection with the
     liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,
     whether voluntary or involuntary), then, in such case, the
     Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall
     equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion
     Price in effect immediately prior to the close of business
     on such Record Date by a fraction of which the numerator
     shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the
     Record Date less the amount of cash so distributed (and not
     excluded as provided above) applicable to one share of
     Common Stock and the denominator shall be such Current
     Market Price of the Common Stock, such reduction to be
     effective immediately prior to the opening of business on
     the day following the Record Date; provided, however, that
     in the event the portion of the cash so distributed
     applicable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or
     greater than the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on
     the Record Date, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment,
     adequate provision shall be made so that each Noteholder
     shall have the right to receive upon conversion the amount
     of cash such holder would have received had such holder
     converted each Note on the Record Date.  In the event that
     such dividend or distribution is not so paid or made, the
     Conversion Price shall again be adjusted to be the
     Conversion Price which would then be in effect if such
     dividend or distribution had not been declared.  If any
     adjustment is required to be made as set forth in this
     Section 15.5(e) as a result of a distribution that is a
     quarterly dividend, such adjustment shall be based upon the
     amount by which such distribution exceeds the amount of the
     quarterly cash dividend permitted to be excluded pursuant
     hereto.  If an adjustment is required to be made as set
     forth in this Section 15.5(e) above as a result of a
     distribution that is not a quarterly dividend, such
     adjustment shall be based upon the full amount of the
     distribution.

          (f)  In case a tender or exchange offer made by the
     Company or any subsidiary of the Company for all or any
     portion of the Common Stock shall expire and such tender or
     exchange offer (as amended upon the expiration thereof)
     shall require the payment to stockholders of consideration
     per share of Common Stock having a fair market value (as
     determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination
     shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the
     Board if Directors) that as of the last time (the
     "Expiration Time") tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant
     to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended) that
     exceeds the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the
     Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, the
     Conversion Price shall be reduced so that the same shall
     equal the price determined by multiplying the Conversion
     Price in effect immediately prior to the Expiration Time by
     a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of
     shares of Common Stock outstanding (including any tendered
     or exchanged shares) on the Expiration Time multiplied by
     the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading
     Day next succeeding the Expiration Time and the denominator
     shall be the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as
     aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to
     shareholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum
     specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of
     all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn
     as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up
     to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased
     Shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of
     Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) on the
     Expiration Time and the Current Market Price of the Common
     Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration
     Time, such reduction to become effective immediately prior
     to the opening of business on the day following the
     Expiration Time.  In the event that the Company is obligated
     to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange
     offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by
     applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such
     purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Price shall again be
     adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in
     effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.

          (g)  In case of a tender or exchange offer made by a
     person other than the Company or any Subsidiary for an
     amount which increases the offeror's ownership of Common
     Stock to more than 25% of the Common Stock outstanding and
     shall involve the payment by such person of consideration
     per share of Common Stock having a fair market value (as
     determined by the Board of Directors, whose determination
     shall be conclusive, and described in a resolution of the
     Board of Directors) at the last time (the "Expiration Time")
     tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or
     exchange offer (as it shall have been amended) that exceeds
     the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading
     Day next succeeding the Expiration Time, and in which, as of
     the Expiration Time the Board of Directors is not
     recommending rejection of the offer, the Conversion Price
     shall be reduced so that the same shall equal the price
     determined by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect
     immediately prior to the Expiration Time by a fraction of
     which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common
     Stock outstanding (including any tendered or exchanged
     shares) on the Expiration Time multiplied by the current
     Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day next
     succeeding the Expiration Time and the denominator shall be
     the sum of (x) the fair market value (determined as
     aforesaid) of the aggregate consideration payable to
     stockholders based on the acceptance (up to any maximum
     specified in the terms of the tender or exchange offer) of
     all shares validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn
     as of the Expiration Time (the shares deemed so accepted, up
     to any such maximum, being referred to as the "Purchased
     Shares") and (y) the product of the number of shares of
     Common Stock outstanding (less any Purchased Shares) on the
     Expiration Time and the Current Market Price of the Common
     Stock on the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration
     Time, such reduction to become effective immediately prior
     to the opening of business on the day following the
     Expiration Time.  In the event that such person is obligated
     to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange
     offer, but such person is permanently prevented by
     applicable law from effecting any such purchases or all such
     purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Price shall again be
     adjusted to be the Conversion Price which would then be in
     effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the adjustment described in
     this Section 15.5(g) shall not be made if, as of the
     Expiration Time, the offering documents with respect to such
     offer disclose a plan or intention to cause the Company to
     engage in any transaction described in Article XII.

          (h)  For purposes of this Section 15.5, the following
     terms shall have the meaning indicated:

               (1)  "Closing Price" with respect to any
          securities on any day shall mean the closing sale price
          regular way on such day or, in case no such sale takes
          place on such day, the average of the reported closing
          bid and asked prices, regular way, in each case on the
          New York Stock Exchange, or, if such security is not
          listed or admitted to trading on such Exchange, on the
          principal national security exchange or quotation
          system on which such security is quoted or listed or
          admitted to trading, or, if not quoted or listed or
          admitted to trading on any national securities exchange
          or quotation system, the average of the closing bid and
          asked prices of such security on the over-the-counter
          market on the day in question as reported by the
          National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or a similar
          generally accepted reporting service, or if not so
          available, in such manner as furnished by any New York
          Stock Exchange member firm selected from time to time
          by the Board of Directors for that purpose, or a price
          determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or,
          to the extent permitted by applicable law, a duly
          authorized committee thereof, whose determination shall
          be conclusive.

               (2)  "Current Market Price" shall mean the average
          of the daily Closing Prices per share of Common Stock
          for the ten consecutive Trading Days immediately prior
          to the date in question; provided, however, that (1) if
          the "ex" date (as hereinafter defined) for any event
          (other than the issuance or distribution or Fundamental
          Change requiring such computation) that requires an
          adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to
          Section 15.5(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) occurs
          during such ten consecutive Trading Days, the Closing
          Price for each Trading Day prior to the "ex" date for
          such other event shall be adjusted by multiplying such
          Closing Price by the same fraction by which the
          Conversion Price is so required to be adjusted as a
          result of such other event, (2) if the "ex" date for
          any event (other than the issuance, distribution or
          Fundamental Change requiring such computation) that
          requires an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant
          to Section 15.5(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g)
          occurs on or after the "ex" date for the issuance or
          distribution requiring such computation and prior to
          the day in question, the Closing Price for each Trading
          Day on and after the "ex" date for such other event
          shall be adjusted by multiplying such Closing Price by
          the reciprocal of the fraction by which the Conversion
          Price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such
          other event, and (3) if the "ex" date for the issuance,
          distribution or Fundamental Change requiring such
          computation is prior to the day in question, after
          taking into account any adjustment required pursuant to
          clause (1) or (2) of this proviso, the Closing Price
          for each Trading Day on or after such "ex" date shall
          be adjusted by adding thereto the amount of any cash
          and the fair market value (as determined by the Board
          of Directors or, to the extent permitted by applicable
          law, a duly authorized committee thereof in a manner
          consistent with any determination of such value for
          purposes of Section 15.5(d), (f) or (g), whose
          determination shall be conclusive and described in a
          resolution of the Board of Directors or such duly
          authorized committee thereof, as the case may be) of
          the evidences of indebtedness, shares of capital stock
          or assets being distributed applicable to one share of
          Common Stock as of the close of business on the day
          before such "ex" date.  For purposes of any computation
          under Section 15.5(f) or (g), the Current Market Price
          of the Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be
          the average of the daily Closing Prices per share of
          Common Stock for such day and the next two succeeding
          Trading Days; provided, however, that if the "ex" date
          for any event (other than the tender or exchange offer
          requiring such computation) that requires an adjustment
          to the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 15.5(a),
          (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) occurs on or after the
          Expiration Time for the tender or exchange offer
          requiring such computation and prior to the day in
          question, the Closing Price for each Trading Day on and
          after the "ex" date for such other event shall be
          adjusted by multiplying such Closing Price by the
          reciprocal of the fraction by which the Conversion
          Price is so required to be adjusted as a result of such
          other event.  For purposes of this paragraph, the term
          "ex" date, (1) when used with respect to any issuance
          or distribution, means the first date on which the
          Common Stock trades regular way on the relevant
          exchange or in the relevant market from which the
          Closing Price was obtained without the right to receive
          such issuance or distribution, (2) when used with
          respect to any subdivision or combination of shares of
          Common Stock, means the first date on which the Common
          Stock trades regular way on such exchange or in such
          market after the time at which such subdivision or
          combination becomes effective, and (3) when used with
          respect to any tender or exchange offer means the first
          date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on
          such exchange or in such market after the Expiration
          Time of such offer.

               (3)  "fair market value" shall mean the amount
          which a willing buyer would pay a willing seller in an
          arm's length transaction.

               (4)  "Record Date" shall mean, with respect to any
          dividend, distribution or other transaction or event in
          which the holders of Common Stock have the right to
          receive any cash, securities or other property or in
          which the Common Stock (or other applicable security)
          is exchanged for or converted into any combination of
          cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for
          determination of shareholders entitled to receive such
          cash, securities or other property (whether such date
          is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute,
          contract or otherwise).

               (5)  "Trading Day" shall mean (x) if the
          applicable security is listed or admitted for trading
          on the New York Stock Exchange or another national
          security exchange, a day on which the New York Stock
          Exchange or another national security exchange is open
          for business or (y) if the applicable security is
          quoted on the Nasdaq National Market, a day on which
          trades may be made on thereon or (z) if the applicable
          security is not so listed, admitted for trading or
          quoted, any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a
          day on which banking institutions in the State of New
          York are authorized or obligated by law or executive
          order to close.

          (i)  The Company may make such reductions in the
     Conversion Price, in addition to those required by
     Sections 15.5 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g), as the
     Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or
     diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights
     to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or
     distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from
     any event treated as such for income tax purposes.

          To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company
     from time to time may reduce the Conversion Price by any
     amount for any period of time if the period is at least
     twenty (20) days, the reduction is irrevocable during the
     period and the Board of Directors shall have made a
     determination that such reduction would be in the best
     interests of the Company, which determination shall be
     conclusive.  Whenever the Conversion Price is reduced
     pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Company shall mail
     to holders of record of the Notes a notice of the reduction
     at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date the reduced
     Conversion Price takes effect, and such notice shall state
     the reduced Conversion Price and the period during which it
     will be in effect.

          (j)  No adjustment in the Conversion Price shall be
     required unless such adjustment would require an increase or
     decrease of at least 1% in such price; provided, however,
     that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 15.5(j)
     are not required to be made shall be carried forward and
     taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.  All
     calculations under this Article XV shall be made by the
     Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the
     nearest one hundredth of a share, as the case may be.  No
     adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock
     pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or
     interest.  To the extent the Notes become convertible into
     cash, assets, property or securities (other than capital
     stock of the Company), no adjustment need be made thereafter
     as to the cash, assets, property or such securities.
     Interest will not accrue on the cash.

          (k)  Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted as
     herein provided, the Company shall promptly file with the
     Trustee and any conversion agent other than the Trustee an
     Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Price
     after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of
     the facts requiring such adjustment.  Promptly after
     delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a
     notice of such adjustment of the Conversion Price setting
     forth the adjusted Conversion Price and the date on which
     each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice
     of such adjustment of the Conversion Price to the holder of
     each Note at his last address appearing on the Note register
     provided for in Section 2.5 of this Indenture, within 20
     days after execution thereof.  Failure to deliver such
     notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such
     adjustment.

          (l)  In any case in which this Section 15.5 provides
     that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after
     a record date for an event, the Company may defer until the
     occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the holder of any
     Note converted after such record date and before the
     occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common
     Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the
     adjustment required by such event over and above the Common
     Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to
     such adjustment and (ii) paying to such holder any amount in
     cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 15.3.

          (m)  For purposes of this Section 15.5, the number of
     shares of Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not
     include shares held in the treasury of the Company but shall
     include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates
     issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock.  The
     Company will not pay any dividend or make any distribution
     on shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the
     Company.

     Section 15.6   Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation,
Merger or Sale.  If any of the following events occur, namely (i)
any reclassification or change of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (other than a subdivision or combination to which
Section 15.5(c) applies), (ii) any consolidation, merger or
combination of the Company with another corporation as a result
of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive
stock, securities or other property or assets (including cash)
with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, or (iii)
any sale or conveyance of the properties and assets of the
Company as, or substantially as, an entirety to any other
corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be
entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets
(including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common
Stock, then the Company or the successor or purchasing
corporation, as the case may be, shall execute with the Trustee a
supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust
Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such
supplemental indenture) providing that such Note shall be
convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other
securities or property or assets (including cash) receivable upon
such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger,
combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such Notes (assuming,
for such purposes, a sufficient number of authorized shares of
Common Stock available to convert all such Notes) immediately
prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger,
combination, sale or conveyance assuming such holder of Common
Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to the
kind or amount of securities, cash or other property receivable
upon such consolidation, merger, statutory exchange, sale or
conveyance (provided that, if the kind or amount of securities,
cash or other property receivable upon such consolidation,
merger, statutory exchange, sale or conveyance is not the same
for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights of
election shall not have been exercised ("nonelecting share")),
then for the purposes of this Section 15.6 the kind and amount of
securities, cash or other property receivable upon such
consolidation, merger, statutory exchange, sale or conveyance for
each non-electing share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount
so receivable per share by a plurality of the non-electing
shares.  Such supplemental indenture shall provide for
adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article.

     The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such
supplemental indenture to be mailed to each holder of Notes, at
his address appearing on the Note register provided for in
Section 2.5 of this Indenture, within twenty (20) days after
execution thereof.   Failure to deliver such notice shall not
affect the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.

     The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply
to successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations,
mergers, combinations, sales and conveyances.

     If this Section 15.6 applies to any event or occurrence,
Section 15.5 shall not apply.

     Section 15.7   Taxes on Shares Issued.  The issue of stock
certificates on conversions of Notes shall be made without charge
to the converting Noteholder for any tax in respect of the issue
thereof.  The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any
tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in
the issue and delivery of stock in any name other than that of
the holder of any Note converted, and the Company shall not be
required to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless
and until the person or persons requesting the issue thereof
shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall
have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax
has been paid.

     Section 15.8   Reservation of Shares; Shares to Be Fully
Paid; Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of
Common Stock.  The Company shall provide, free from preemptive
rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares or shares held
in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide for the
conversion of the Notes from time to time as such Notes are
presented for conversion.

     Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
reducing the Conversion Price below the then par value, if any,
of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Notes, the Company will take all corporate action which may, in
the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common Stock
at such adjusted Conversion Price.

     The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which
may be issued upon conversion of Notes will upon issue be fully
paid and non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes,
liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof.

     The Company covenants that if any shares of Common Stock to
be provided for the purpose of conversion of Notes hereunder
require registration with or approval of any governmental
authority under any federal or state law before such shares may
be validly issued upon conversion, the Company will in good faith
and as expeditiously as possible endeavor to secure such
registration or approval, as the case may be.

     The Company further covenants that if at any time the Common
Stock shall be listed on the Nasdaq National Market or any other
national securities exchange or automated quotation system the
Company will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or
automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the
Common Stock shall be so listed on such exchange or automated
quotation system, all Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Notes; provided, however, that if rules of such exchange or
automated quotation system permit the Company to defer the
listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of the
Notes into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this
Indenture, the Company covenants to list such Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Notes in accordance with the
requirements of such exchange or automated quotation system at
such time.

     Section 15.9   Responsibility of Trustee.  The Trustee and
any other conversion agent shall not at any time be under any
duty or responsibility to any holder of Notes to determine
whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the
Conversion Price, or with respect to the nature or extent or
calculation of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to
the method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture
provided to be employed, in making the same.  The Trustee and any
other conversion agent shall not be accountable with respect to
the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of
Common Stock, or of any securities or property, which may at any
time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Note; and
the Trustee and any other conversion agent make no
representations with respect thereto.  Subject to the provisions
of Section 8.1, neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent
shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue,
transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock
certificates or other securities or property or cash upon the
surrender of any Note for the purpose of conversion or to comply
with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of the
Company contained in this Article.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any
conversion agent shall be under any responsibility to determine
the correctness of any provisions contained in any supplemental
indenture entered into pursuant to Section 15.6 relating either
to the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or
property (including cash) receivable by Noteholders upon the
conversion of their Notes after any event referred to in such
Section 15.6 or to any adjustment to be made with respect
thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, may
accept as conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such
provisions, and shall be protected in relying upon, the Officers'
Certificate (which the Company shall be obligated to file with
the Trustee prior to the execution of any such supplemental
indenture) with respect thereto.

     Section 15.10  Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions.
In case:

          (a)  the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other
     distribution) on its Common Stock that would require an
     adjustment in the Conversion Price pursuant to Section 15.5;
     or

          (b)  the Company shall authorize the granting to the
     holders of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to
     subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any
     other rights or warrants; or

          (c)  of any reclassification or reorganization of the
     Common Stock of the Company (other than a subdivision or
     combination of its outstanding Common Stock, or a change in
     par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par
     value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to
     which the Company is a party and for which approval of any
     shareholders of the Company is required, or of the sale or
     transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the
     Company; or

          (d)  of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
     liquidation or winding-up of the Company;

the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be
mailed to each holder of Notes at his address appearing on the
Note register provided for in Section 2.5 of this Indenture, as
promptly as possible but in any event at least fifteen (15) days
prior to the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice
stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the
purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or,
if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders
of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend,
distribution or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on
which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to
become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled
to exchange their Common Stock for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.  Failure
to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the
legality or validity of such dividend, distribution,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer,
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up.

shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such pre-approved
payments, subject to Section 8.6.

  meet the Supply Commitment (in other words, the third month
  including the month in which the difficulty occurs).

  Third, Epson will use its best efforts to make available
  during the above-referenced three (3) month period sufficient
  capacity at the Sakata Facility and the Fujimi Facility to
  cover the deficiency between the Supply Commitment and the
  actual capacity subject to completion of product
  qualification. The parties acknowledge, however, that Epson
  cannot guarantee the use of capacity at the Sakata Facility or
  the Fujimi Facility.

  ***

  Fifth, in the event that the above measures are insufficient
  and the parties are unable to negotiate in good faith a
  resolution of the difficulty, then Xilinx, at its option, may
  elect to be repaid that portion of the Advance Payment
  currently outstanding and Xilinx shall have no further
  obligations under this Agreement.

6.4.2 Failure Due to Xilinx
  Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 6.4 to the
  contrary, in the event that Epson fails to fulfill the Supply
  Commitment in any month due to (a) design defects in Products
  caused by Xilinx, (b) design changes requested by Xilinx, (c)
  process flow changes requested by Xilinx or (d) any other
  reason caused by Xilinx, Epson will only be required to make
  reasonable efforts to fulfill the Supply Commitment in such
  month. Provisions concerning Xilinx's failure to fulfill its
  Purchase Commitment are set forth in Article 7.2.

6.4.3 Failure Due to Both Parties
  Notwithstanding anything contained in Article 6.4.1, 6.4.2 or
  7.1 to the contrary, in the event that Epson fails to fulfill
  the Supply Commitment (and Xilinx fails to fulfill the
  Purchase Commitment) due to difficulties caused jointly by
  Xilinx and Epson, the parties will mutually agree in writing
  upon a fair and equitable solution.

6.4.4 Failure Due to Catastrophe
  In the event that any fire, flood, earthquake, explosion or
  any other catastrophe prevents Epson from fabricating New
  Facility Wafers for Xilinx, (a) Epson will immediately
  implement the measures required by Article 6.4.1, (b) Epson
  will permit Xilinx to inspect the New Facility, and (c) the
  parties will begin good faith negotiations to agree on a
  corrective action plan.


7 Purchase Commitment

7.1 Purchase Commitment for the New Facility Wafers
  Xilinx will purchase each month the number of New Facility
  Wafers (the "Purchase Commitment") equal to the Supply
  Commitment until *** wafers have been purchased. Xilinx will
  not be required to fulfill the Purchase Commitment in the
  event that Epson fails to fulfill the Supply Commitment in the
  manner specified in Article 6.4.1. Instead, Xilinx will be
  required to purchase those New Facility Wafers that Epson is
  able to fabricate. Xilinx will not be required to fulfill the
  Purchase Commitment in the event of difficulties caused by
  both Epson and Xilinx. Instead, the parties will mutually
  agree in writing upon a fair and equitable solution.

7.2 Sale of Unused Capacity
  In the event that Xilinx is unable to fulfill the Purchase
  Commitment in any month for reasons not due to Epson, Epson
  will use its best efforts to sell unused capacity to other
  customers, or to allocate unused capacity for the fabrication
  of Epson products during such month. Further, Epson's Supply
  Commitment for such month will be reduced to the same extent
  that Xilinx is unable to fulfill the Purchase Commitment. When
  Xilinx desires to increase its monthly purchases after Epson
  has sold or otherwise allocated unused capacity, then Epson
  will use its best efforts to increase capacity for Xilinx to
  the Supply Commitment in an expeditious manner. The parties
  will mutually agree upon the specific rate at which Epson will
  be required to ramp up capacity to the Supply Commitment.


8 Free Wafers
  Epson will provide Xilinx with *** free wafers of a Product
  specified by Xilinx at a time specified by Xilinx for, and in
  addition to, every *** New Facility Wafers ordered and
  accepted by Xilinx (the "Free Wafers"). Free Wafers will be
  provided free of charge to Xilinx and will not be credited
  against the amount of the Advanced Payment. Epson will provide
  Free Wafers until Xilinx has received *** New Facility Wafers
  (excluding the Free Wafers). Epson will provide Xilinx with
  Free Wafers as an inducement for Xilinx to enter into this
  Agreement.


9 Fabrication and Purchase and Sale of the Product

9.1 General Terms and Conditions
  The terms and conditions for the prototype wafer fabrication,
  wafer fabrication, order and acceptance, shipping, insurance
  and warranty for the Products will be set forth in the
  Purchase Agreements. The parties hereby express their
  good-faith commitment to sign all Purchase Agreements required
  to implement the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Epson
  agrees to provide all Products covered by this Agreement in
  the manner required by the Purchase Agreements. The parties
  acknowledge that a best estimation and target of defect
  densities as at the date of this Agreement is set forth in
  Exhibit E attached hereto, which will be reviewed and amended
  from time to time by the parties hereto, and will be
  incorporated into all Purchase Agreements.

9.2 Start of Production
  Qualification testing for the Products will be conducted in
  the manner mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties.
  Once any Product has been qualified, Epson will begin mass
  production of such Product.

9.3 Turn Around Time
  The parties acknowledge that the lead time for shipment of New
  Facility Wafers, defined as the time from Xilinx's process
  release until delivery of New Facility Wafers to assembler,
  known as a "turn around time", is of the essence, and agree
  that the parties shall set annual target turn around time and
  make their joint efforts to achieve such target in accordance
  with Exhibit F ("Turn Around Time").


10 Wafer Pricing and Payment

10.1 Determination of Price
  The parties have already expressly agreed to (a) certain
  procedures to annually determine prices of New Facility Wafers
  (the "Price") and (b) certain procedures of determining the
  price of all Products per die, as described in Exhibit D. The
  Price herein shall be applicable until Xilinx has completed
  the purchase of *** wafers under the terms of this Agreement.


10.2 Shipping. Insurance. Taxes. Duties and Other Fees
  Epson will deliver the Products to Xilinx's designated
  facility in Japan or Xilinx's designated carrier in Japan on
  an F.O.B. basis. Epson will be responsible for paying, in
  connection with such sale and delivery in Japan (a) all
  domestic freight, insurance and other shipping expenses and
  (b) sales, use, excise, ad valorem, withholding or other
  taxes. The risk of loss will pass to Xilinx at F.O.B. point in
  Japan. Further, Xilinx will be responsible for paying all
  freight, insurance, fees, expenses, taxes, tariffs and duties
  required in connection with the export of the Products from
  F.O.B. point in Japan and the import into any other country.

10.3 Payment
  Other than through offset of the Advance Payment, Xilinx will
  not be required to pay for any New Facility Wafers delivered
  under this Agreement or any Purchase Agreement until the
  Advance Payment has been fully offset and reduced. Once the
  Advance Payment is fully offset and reduced, Xilinx will be
  required to pay Epson in the manner specified in the Purchase
  Agreements based on the Price until Xilinx has purchased ***
  New Facility Wafers.

10.4 Die Based Transaction
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
  parties acknowledge and agree that all purchases made pursuant
  to Purchase Agreements, starting with the purchase of ***
  devices, will be made on a "good die basis" even though the
  Supply Commitment, the Purchase Commitment and other
  obligations of this Agreement are described on a wafer basis.
  Such "good die basis" transaction shall be made in reference
  to "Die Pricing Mechanism in Exhibit D" and "Defect Density
  Goal" in Exhibit E.


11 Additional Funding by Xilinx
     Xilinx agrees to make funding to Epson of one hundred
     million U. S. dollars (US$100,000,000) , in addition to its
     funding of the Advance Payment, in accordance with the
     following conditions:    
     a) At such time as Xilinx makes the
     sixth installment of the Advance Payment pursuant to Section
     4.1(f) above (the "Sixth Installment Date"), the parties
     shall commence negotiations on the form of the additional
     funding comprising the following funding methods:
       i) security deposit;
       ii) additional advance Payment ("additional Advance
         Payment"); or
       iii) other commercially reasonable alternative.
     b) If Xilinx chooses the security deposit alternative, the
     parties shall negotiate in good faith the detailed conditions
     of such security deposit, including without limitation the
     following: i)  discount rate on the Price calculated in Free
     Wafers; and
       ii) repayment schedule
     c) If the parties agree on the additional Advance Payment
     alternative, Xilinx's additional   funding shall be made
     as an additional Advance Payment, and will be deemed to be
     a part    of the Advance Payment for all purposes
     hereunder.
     d) Regardless of the form of the funding agreed to by the
     parties, Xilinx's additional funding shall be made
     subject to the following conditions, unless the parties
     agree otherwise:
          i) payment shall be made in two installments of
     fifty million U.S. dollars (US$50,000,000) each, which
     will become due and payable when the unused balance of
     the Advance Payment and any previously-paid additional
     Advance Payment becomes less than one hundred twenty-five
     million U.S. dollars (US$125,000,000), provided that if
     the security deposit alternative is chosen, the first
     installment shall be made at such time as Xilinx has
     purchased fifty million U.S. dollars (US$50,000,000) of
     New Facility Wafers subsequent to the Sixth Installment
     Date, and the second installment shall be made at such
     time as Xilinx has purchased fifty million U.S. dollars
     (US$50,000,000) of New Facility Wafers subsequent to the
     date the first security deposit installment is paid; and
          ii) other conditions, including Free Wafers and
     procedures to offset from the additional Advance Payment
     shall remain unchanged from those applied to the original
     Advance Payment.


12 Technical Cooperation and Support
  The parties desire to engage in various types of joint
  development and technical cooperation activities required to
  fabricate Products and to effectuate the terms and conditions
  of this Agreement. The parties agree to negotiate in good
  faith a joint development and technical cooperation agreement
  in the future. Also the parties will continue to develop
  jointly *** process under the terms of separate agreements to
  be executed between the parties from time to time for specific
  projects or product development work.


13 Intellectual Property Rights
  Epson warrants that it has all necessary rights to develop,
  manufacture and sell to Xilinx the New Facility Wafers. Epson
  will indemnify and hold harmless Xilinx from any loss, damage
  or expense (including attorney's fees) arising from claims
  that the sale or use of the New Facility Wafers infringes on
  the intellectual property rights of third parties except where
  such infringement is caused by Xilinx's instruction or
  specifications thereto.
