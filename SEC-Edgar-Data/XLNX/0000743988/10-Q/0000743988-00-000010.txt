              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.     The  accompanying  interim  consolidated  financial  statements have been
prepared  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and should
be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Xilinx,  Inc.  (Xilinx  or  the  Company)
consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 1, 2000.  The balance
sheet at April 1, 2000 is derived from audited financial statements. The interim
financial statements are unaudited but reflect all adjustments which are, in the
opinion of management, of a normal, recurring nature necessary to present fairly
the  statements  of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the  interim  periods  presented.  The  results for the three-month period ended
July  1, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for  the  year  ending  March  31,  2001  or  any  future  period.

2.     Inventories  are  stated  at  the  lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market  (estimated net realizable value).  Inventories at July 1, 2000 and April
1,  2000  are  as  follows:

3.     The  computation  of basic net income per share for all periods presented
is  derived from the information on the face of the statement of operations, and
there  are  no  reconciling  items  to net income.  The total shares used in the
denominator  of  the  diluted  net  income  per  share calculation includes 27.4
million  and  23.0 million incremental common shares attributable to outstanding
options  for  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year 2001 and 2000, respectively.

Outstanding options to purchase approximately 2.9 million and 0.4 million shares
for  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal year 2001 and 2000, respectively, under the
Company's  Stock Option Plan were not included in the treasury stock calculation
to  derive  diluted  net  income  per share as their inclusion would have had an
anti-dilutive effect.  In addition, the put warrants disclosed in Note 5 did not
have  any  impact  on  basic or diluted net income per share in the three months
ended  July  1,  2000  and  July  3,  1999  as their inclusion would have had an
anti-dilutive  effect.

5.     Our  Board of Directors has approved stock repurchase programs that allow
us  to  repurchase shares of our common stock.  During the first three months of
fiscal  2001, we repurchased 839,000 shares of common stock under our authorized
repurchase  program  at  a cost of $53.8 million.  In conjunction with the stock
repurchase  program,  during  the  three  months ended July 1, 2000, we sold put
warrants  that  entitle  the  holder  of each warrant to sell to us, by physical
delivery,  one  share  of common stock at a specified price, ranging from $56 to
$66  per  share.  The  outstanding  put  warrants  will  expire at various dates
through  July  2001.  As  of  July  1,  2000,  1.4  million  put  warrants  are
outstanding.

6.     In  June  1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  133,  (FASB  133),  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  which  requires adoption in
fiscal  years  beginning after June 15, 2000 while earlier adoption is permitted
at  the  beginning  of  any  fiscal quarter.  We are required to adopt by fiscal
2002.  The  effect  of adopting the Standard is currently being evaluated but is
not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations
or financial position.  FASB 133 will require us to recognize all derivatives on
the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  Derivatives  that  are not hedges must be
adjusted  to fair value through income.  If the derivative is a hedge, depending
on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either
be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or
firm  commitments  through  earnings  or  recognized  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income  until  the  hedged  item  is recognized in earnings.  The
ineffective  portion,  if  any,  of  a derivative's change in fair value will be
immediately  recognized  in  earnings.

In  December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued SEC Staff
Accounting  Bulletin  No.  101  (SAB  101),  "Revenue  Recognition  in Financial
Statements."  SAB  101  summarizes  certain  of  the  SEC's  views  in  applying
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  to revenue recognition in financial
statements.  We  believe  that  our  current  revenue  recognition  policy  is
consistent  with  the  guidance  of  SAB  101.

7.     In  1996,  Xilinx,  United  Microelectronics  Corporation (UMC) and other
parties  entered  into a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication facility
in  Taiwan,  known as United Silicon Inc. (USIC).  We had a 20% equity ownership
in  USIC  and  had  the right to receive up to 31.25% of the wafer capacity from
this  facility.  We  accounted  for  this  investment using the equity method of
accounting  with  a  one-month  lag  in  recording  our share of results for the
entity.

In  January  2000,  our equity position in USIC was converted into shares of UMC
which  are  publicly  traded  on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.  As a result of this
merger,  we  own  approximately  222  million  shares of UMC common stock, which
represent  approximately  2%  of  the  combined UMC Group.  We retain equivalent
wafer  capacity rights in UMC as we previously had in USIC, as long as we retain
a percentage of our shares of UMC common stock.  If our holdings fall below this
level,  our  wafer capacity rights would be decreased prorated by the UMC shares
we  hold.  (See  also, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Factors Affecting Future Operating Results
- - Investment  Company  Act  of  1940.)

Due  to  restrictions imposed by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange, the majority
of  our  UMC  shares  may  not  be  sold  until  July  2000.  These  regulatory
restrictions  will gradually expire between July 2000 and January 2004.  At July
1,  2000,  the  restricted portion of our UMC investment totaled $396.5 million.
In June 2000, UMC distributed a dividend, in the form of dividend shares, at the
rate  of  200  shares  for  every 1,000 UMC shares held.  Xilinx's dividend will
equal  approximately  44  million  shares.

8.     On June 7, 1993, we filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in the
United  States  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District  of California for
infringement of certain of our patents.  Subsequently, Altera filed suit against
Xilinx,  alleging  that certain of our products infringe certain Altera patents.
Fact  and  expert  discovery  have been completed in both cases, which have been
consolidated.  Both  Altera  and Xilinx filed motions with the Court for summary
judgement  with respect to certain of the issues pending in the litigation.   In
October  1999,  the  Court  ruled  on all but one of the motions. As a result of
those  rulings,  Altera is left with one claim against Xilinx, which remains the
subject  of  a  Company  motion for summary judgment. A ruling on this motion is
pending. The Court's rulings also dismissed certain claims by us, leaving intact
claims of infringement by Altera under two Company patents. The remaining claims
against Altera will be decided at a trial scheduled to begin on October 5, 2000.
If  the remaining claim against Xilinx survives the motion for summary judgment,
it  will  be  decided  at  a  trial,  which  is  unscheduled  at  this  point.

On April 20, 1995, Altera filed an additional suit against Xilinx in the Federal
District  Court in Delaware, alleging that our XC5200 family infringes an Altera
patent.  We  answered the Delaware suit denying that the XC5200 family infringes
the  patent  in suit, asserting certain affirmative defenses and counterclaiming
that  the Altera Max 9000 family infringes certain of our patents.  The Delaware
suit  was  transferred  to  the  United  States  District Court for the Northern
District  of  California.

On  July  22, 1998, Altera and Joseph Ward, a former Xilinx employee, filed suit
against  Xilinx in Superior Court in Santa Clara County, California, arising out
of  our  efforts  to  prevent  disclosure  of  certain  Company  confidential
information.  Altera's  suit  requests  declaratory  relief  and  claims  Xilinx
engages  in  unfair  business  practices  and  interference  with  contractual
relations.  On  September 10, 1998 we filed cross claims against Altera and Ward
for  unfair  competition  and  breach  of  contract,  among other claims, in the
California  action.  On  October  20,  1998,  Altera  and Ward filed crossclaims
against  Xilinx  for  malicious  prosecution  of civil action and defamation. On
September 15, 1999, the Court dismissed all of our claims against Altera and Mr.
Ward, finding that we were unable to show any damages we suffered as a result of
any  actions  by  Mr.  Ward.  Claims  against  Xilinx  are  still  pending.

On  May  31, 2000, Altera filed an additional suit against Xilinx in the Federal
District  Court  for  the Northern District of California, alleging that certain
Xilinx  products,  including  our  Virtex  FPGAs, infringe three Altera patents.
Altera's  suit  requests  unspecified monetary damages as well as issuance of an
injunction  to  prevent Xilinx from selling allegedly infringing parts.   Xilinx
has answered the complaint, denied the allegations, and has filed a counterclaim
alleging  that Altera is infringing additional Company patents.  Altera's motion
for  expedited  discovery  was  denied  by  the  Court.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has  meritorious  defenses to such claims and is
defending them vigorously.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement subject
to risks and uncertainties, and the future outcome of these matters could differ
materially  due to the uncertain nature of each legal proceeding and because the
lawsuits  are  still  in  the  pre-trial  stages.

There  are  no  other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which we
are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.  We know of no legal
proceedings  contemplated  by  any  governmental  authority  or  agency.


Item  2.     Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations

The  following  discussion  contains  forward-looking  statements, which involve
numerous  risks  and  uncertainties.  Actual  results  may  differ  materially.
Certain  of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under "Factors Affecting
Future  Operating  Results".

RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS:  FIRST  QUARTER  OF  FISCAL  2001 COMPARED TO THE FIRST
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUARTER  OF  FISCAL  2000
- -------------------------

NET  REVENUES

We  currently classify our product offerings into four categories by technology.
Base  products  consist  of  our  mature  product  families  that  are currently
manufactured  on technologies of 0.6-micron and older; this includes the XC2000,
XC3000,  XC3100,  XC4000 and XC7000 families.  Mainstream products are currently
manufactured  on  0.35  and  0.5-micron  technologies  and  include the XC4000E,
XC4000EX, XC4000XL, XC5200, XC9500, XC9500XL, Spartan(TM) and CoolRunner(R)
product lines.  Advanced products include our newest technologies manufactured
on 0.25-micron and smaller, which include the  XC4000XV, XC4000XLA, Spartan XL,
Spartan-II, Virtex(TM), and Virtex-E product lines. Our Support products make
up the  remainder  of our product offerings and include serial proms, HardWire,
and software.

Net revenues of $364.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2001 represented a
72.6%  increase  from  the  comparable  prior  year  quarter  of $211.4 million.
Product  lines that experienced significant growth during the three-month period
include  the  XC4000XLA, XC9500, Spartan, and Virtex families.  The increases in
revenues  of  Advanced  products  are  due to the introduction and strong market
acceptance  of XC4000XLA, Spartan XL and Virtex products.  Increases in revenues
of  Mainstream  products  are  attributable  mainly  to  growth in the XC4000XL,
Spartan, XC9500 and XC9500XL product lines.  Revenues of Base products decreased
slightly  as customers migrated to newer product offerings.  Revenues of Support
products  increased  due  to increased sale of serial proms, driven by growth in
supporting  Spartan  and  Virtex  families.  We  have  historically been able to
offset  much  of  the revenue declines of our mature technologies with increased
revenues from newer technologies, although no assurance can be given that we can
continue  to do so in the future.  The revenue by technology for the three month
periods  ended  July  1,  2000  and  July  3,  1999  are  as  follows:

revenue  by geography for the three month periods ended July 1, 2000 and July 3,
1999  are  as  follows:

The  European  revenue  increases are driven by the 4000XLA and Virtex families.
The  revenue  increases  in  Japan are mainly driven by the Virtex family.  Asia
Pacific/Rest  of  World revenue increases are driven by the CPLD, Virtex and the
4000X  Product  families.

GROSS  MARGIN

Gross  margin  was $227.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2001, or 62.5%
of  revenues  as  compared  to $131.6 million, or 62.3% of revenues in the first
quarter of fiscal 2000.  The slight increase in gross margin percentage compared
to  last  year was driven by product mix as well as continued benefits from cost
improvements  and  manufacturing process technology advances.  We recognize that
ongoing  price  reductions for our integrated circuits are a significant element
in expanding the market for our products.  Management believes that gross margin
objectives of approximately 62% of revenues are consistent with expanding market
share  while  realizing  acceptable  returns, although there can be no assurance
that  future  gross  margins  will  remain  in  this  range.

RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

Research  and  development expenditures were $43.2 million, or 11.8% of revenues
for  the  first quarter of fiscal 2001 as compared to $26.0 million, or 12.3% of
revenues  for  the first quarter of fiscal 2000.  Although total expenditures on
research and development increased significantly, they decreased as a percent of
revenue  because  of  strong revenue growth.  The 66.1% increase in expenditures
over  the  prior  year  period was primarily due to designing and developing new
product  architectures  of  complex,  high  density  devices  including  wafer
purchases,  development  of advanced process technologies, software development,
increased labor-related costs, and testing of new products.  We remain committed
to  a  significant level of research and development effort in order to maintain
our  technology  leadership  in  the  programmable  logic  industry.

SALES,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE

Sales,  general  and  administrative  expenses  were  $63.4 million, or 17.4% of
revenues  for  the first quarter of fiscal 2001 as compared to $39.5 million, or
18.7%  of  revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2000.  Although total sales,
general  and  administrative  expenses increased, they decreased as a percent of
revenue  because  of strong revenue growth.  The increases in sales, general and
administrative  expenses  were  primarily  attributable  to  increased marketing
expenses  and  increased  sales  costs  on  higher revenues along with increased
personnel  costs.  We  remain  committed to controlling administrative expenses.
However, the timing and extent of future legal costs associated with the ongoing
enforcement  of our intellectual property rights are not readily predictable and
may  increase  significantly  in  the  future.

INTEREST  AND  OTHER,  NET

Interest and other income, net increased to $9.0 million in the first quarter of
fiscal  2001  from  $5.7  million in the same prior year quarter.  The increases
were  primarily due to the increased average cash and investment balances in the
first  three  months  of  fiscal  2001  as  compared  to  the prior year quarter
resulting  in  increased  interest  income  of  $4.7 million over the prior year
period.  The amount of net interest and other income in the future will continue
to  be  impacted  by  the  level  of  our  average  cash and investment balance,
prevailing  interest  rates,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.

PROVISION  FOR  INCOME  TAXES

We  recorded  a  tax  provision of $36.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal
2001  as  compared  to $20.8 million in the same prior year period, representing
effective  tax  rates  of  28.0% and 29.0%, respectively.  The lower tax rate is
primarily  due  to increased profits in foreign jurisdictions where the tax rate
is  lower  than  the  U.S.  rate.

JOINT  VENTURE  EQUITY  INCOME

Prior  to  the  conversion  of  USIC  shares  to  UMC  shares,  we  recorded our
proportional  ownership  of  the  net  income of USIC, a wafer fabrication joint
venture  located  in  Taiwan, as joint venture equity income.   We recorded $0.7
million  equity in income of joint venture for the first quarter of fiscal 2000.
As a result of the conversion of our equity position in USIC to shares of UMC in
January  2000,  as discussed in Note 7, we no longer record joint venture equity
income.

HEDGING

We  use  forward  currency  exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks.
Our  sales  to  Japanese customers are denominated in yen while our purchases of
processed  silicon  wafers  from Japanese foundries are primarily denominated in
U.S.  dollars.  Gains  and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are
designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm
commitment  has  been  attained,  are  deferred and included in the basis of the
transaction  in  the  same  period that the underlying transactions are settled.
Gains  and  losses  on  any  instruments  not  meeting  the  above  criteria are
recognized  in  income  in  the  current  period.  We  are  also sharing the yen
exchange  rate  risk  with  some  of our Japanese customers through risk sharing
agreements.  As  we will continue to have a net yen exposure in the near future,
we  will  continue  to  mitigate the exposure through yen hedging contracts.  No
currency  forward  contracts  were  outstanding  as  of  July  1,  2000.

INFLATION

To  date,  the  effects  of  inflation  upon our financial results have not been
significant.


FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES
- ---------------------------------------------------------

Our  financial  condition at July 1, 2000 remained strong.  Total current assets
exceeded  total current liabilities by 3.8 times, compared to 4.3 times at April
1,  2000.  We have used a combination of equity and cash flow from operations to
support on-going business activities, secure manufacturing capacity from foundry
partners,  make  acquisitions  and  investments  in  complementary technologies,
obtain  facilities  and  capital  equipment  and  finance inventory and accounts
receivable.

We  continued  to  generate positive cash flows from operations during the first
three  months of fiscal 2001.  As of July 1, 2000, we had cash, cash equivalents
and  short-term  investments  of  $687.9  million  and working capital of $884.2
million.  Cash  generated  by  operations  of $121.4 million for the first three
months  of fiscal 2001 was $37.7 million higher than the $83.7 million generated
from  the  first  three  months  of fiscal 2000.  Increases in cash generated by
operations resulted primarily from the cash flow impact of increased net income,
and  increases in accounts payable, income taxes payable, and deferred income on
shipments  to  distributors which were partially offset by increases in accounts
receivable  and  inventories.

Cash  flows  used for investing activities during the three months ended July 1,
2000  included  net  investment purchases of $6.7 million, and $21.9 million for
property,  plant  and  equipment.  During the first three months of fiscal 2000,
investing  activities  included  net  investment purchases of $25.9 million, and
$9.9  million  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  acquisitions.

Net  cash  flows  used  by  financing activities were $29.0 million in the first
three  months  of  fiscal  2001  and  were  attributable  to  $53.8  million  in
acquisition  of  treasury  stock,  offset  by  $15.1  million  proceeds from the
issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $9.7 million in proceeds
from  sales  of  put  warrants.  For  the  comparable  fiscal  2000 period, cash
provided  by  financing  activities  of  $9.3  million included $13.1 million of
proceeds  from  issuance  of  common  stock  under employee stock plans and $1.5
million  in  proceeds  from  sales  of  put  warrants,  offset by acquisition of
treasury  stock  of  $5.3  million.

Stockholders'  equity  increased  $20.6 million during the first three months of
fiscal  2001, principally as a result of the $93.8 million in net income for the
three months ended July 1, 2000.  In addition, the proceeds from the issuance of
common  stock  under employee stock plans of $15.1 million, related tax benefits
from  stock options of $34.1 million, and $9.7 million in proceeds from sales of
put  warrants  contributed to the increase, which were partially offset by $78.3
million in unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities primarily from our
investment  in  UMC  stock,  the  cumulative  translation  adjustment, and $53.8
million  for  acquisition  of  treasury  stock.

We  have  available  credit  facilities  for  up  to $46.2 million of which $6.2
million  is  intended  to  meet  occasional working capital requirements for our
wholly  owned  Irish  subsidiary.  As  of  July 1, 2000, we have $1.4 million in
outstanding  borrowings  under  the  lines  of  credit.

We  anticipate  that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations
will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.  We
will  continue  to  evaluate  opportunities to obtain additional wafer capacity,
procure  additional  capital equipment and facilities, develop new products, and
acquire  businesses,  products  or  technologies  that  would  complement  our
businesses  and  may  use  available  cash  or other sources of funding for such
purposes.


FACTORS  AFFECTING  FUTURE  OPERATING  RESULTS
- ----------------------------------------------

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized  by  rapid technological change,
intense  competition and cyclical market patterns.  Cyclical market patterns are
characterized  by  several  factors,  including:

  -     reduced  product  demand;
  -     limited  visibility  of  demand  for  products  beyond  three  months;
  -     accelerated  erosion  of  average  selling  prices;  and
  -     tight  capacity  availability.

Our results of operations are affected by several factors. These factors include
general  economic conditions, conditions specific to technology companies and to
the  semiconductor  industry  in particular, decreases in average selling prices
over the life of particular products and the timing of new product introductions
(by us, our competitors and others.)  In addition, our results of operations are
affected  by the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product
in a timely manner, the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies,
the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors, the
impact  of  new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some
products  in  the  face  of equally steep declines in demand for others, and the
inability  to  predict  the success of our customers' products in their markets.
Market demand for our products, particularly for those most recently introduced,
can  be  difficult  to  predict,  especially  in  light of customers' demands to
shorten  product lead times and minimize inventory levels.  Unpredictable market
demand  could lead to revenue volatility if we were unable to provide sufficient
quantities  of  specified  products.  In  addition,  any difficulty in achieving
targeted  wafer production yields could adversely affect our financial condition
and  results  of operations. We attempt to identify changes in market conditions
as  soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market make prediction of and
timely  reaction  to such events difficult.  Due to these and other factors, our
past  results,  including those described in this report, are much less reliable
predictors of the future than with companies in many older, more stable and less
dynamic  industries.  Based  on  the  factors  noted  herein,  we may experience
substantial  period-to-period  fluctuations  in  future  operating  results.

Our  future  success depends in a large part on the continued service of our key
technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel  and on our ability to
continue  to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly important are
those  highly  skilled  design, process, software and test engineers involved in
the  manufacture  of  existing  products and the development of new products and
processes.  The  competition  for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key
employees  could  have  a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results  of  operations.

Sales  and  operations  outside  of  the  United  States subject us to the risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.  Our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could be
adversely  affected  by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we
do  significant  business  and  by  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates
affecting  those  countries.  For  example, we have sales and operations in Asia
Pacific  and  Japan.  Past economic weakness in these markets adversely affected
revenues,  and  such  conditions  may  occur  in the future.  Customers may face
reduced  access  to  capital and exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect
their  ability  to  purchase  our products.  In addition, our ability to sell at
competitive  prices may be diminished.  Currency instability may increase credit
risks as the weak currencies may impair our customers' ability to repay existing
obligations.  Any  or  all of these factors could adversely affect our financial
condition  and  results  of  operations  in  the  near  future.

Our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations are becoming increasingly
dependent  on  the  global  economy.  Any  instability  in  worldwide  economic
environments  could  lead to a contraction of capital spending by our customers.
Additional  risks  to us include government regulation of exports, imposition of
tariffs  and other potential trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual
property  rights  in  some  countries and generally longer receivable collection
periods.  Moreover,  our  financial condition and results of operations could be
affected  in  the  event of political conflicts in Taiwan where our main foundry
partner,  UMC,  is  located.

Our  business  is  also  subject  to the risks associated with the imposition of
legislation  and  regulations  relating  specifically to the import or export of
semiconductor  products.  We  cannot  predict  whether  quotas, duties, taxes or
other  charges  or  restrictions  will  be imposed by the United States or other
countries  upon  the  import  or  export  of  our products in the future or what
effect,  if  any, such actions would have on our financial condition and results
of  operations.

We  do not directly manufacture our silicon wafers. Presently, all of our wafers
are manufactured by our foundry partners in Taiwan by UMC and in Japan by Seiko.
We  depend  on  our  foundry  partners  to deliver reliable silicon wafers, with
acceptable  yields,  in  a  timely manner. If our foundry partners are unable to
produce  and  deliver  silicon  wafers  that  meet our specifications, including
acceptable  yields,  our  results  of  operation  could  be  adversely affected.

Our  foundry  partners  in  Taiwan  and  Japan  and  many  of  our operations in
California are centered in areas that have been seismically active in the recent
past.  Should  there  be  a  major  earthquake in our operating locations in the
future,  our  operations,  including  our  manufacturing  activities,  may  be
disrupted.  This  type  of  disruption  could  result  in  our inability to ship
products  in  a  timely  manner,  thereby  materially  adversely  affecting  our
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

The  securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject
to  extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market
price  of  our  common  stock.

DEPENDENCE  UPON  INDEPENDENT  MANUFACTURERS  AND  SUBCONTRACTORS

We  do  not  manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products.  During
the  past  several  years,  most of our wafers have been manufactured by UMC and
Seiko,  with  recent wafers also manufactured by USIC until its merger into UMC.
We  are  dependent  upon  these  suppliers  and  others  to  produce wafers with
competitive  performance  and  cost  attributes  which  include transitioning to
advanced  manufacturing  process  technologies,  producing  wafers at acceptable
yields  and delivering them in a timely manner.  While the timeliness, yield and
quality  of  wafer  deliveries  have  met  our  requirements  to date, we cannot
guarantee  that  our  wafer  suppliers  will not experience future manufacturing
problems,  including delays in the realization of advanced manufacturing process
technologies.  Additionally, disruption of operations at these foundries for any
reason,  including  natural  disasters such as fires, floods, or earthquakes, as
well  as  disruptions in access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas
or  water  could  cause  delays  in  shipments of our products, and could have a
material  adverse effect on our results of operations.  We are also dependent on
subcontractors  to  provide  semiconductor  assembly  services.  Any  prolonged
inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and
cost  attributes,  adequate yields or timely delivery, or any other circumstance
that  would  require  us  to  seek  alternative  sources  of supply, could delay
shipments  and  have  a  material  adverse effect on our financial condition and
results  of  operations.

Our growth will depend in large part upon our ability to obtain additional wafer
fabrication  capacity  and  assembly  services  from  suppliers  that  are  cost
competitive.  We  consider  various  alternatives  in order to secure additional
wafer  capacity.  These  alternatives  include,  without  limitation,  equity
investments  in,  or  loans,  deposits,  or  other  financial  commitments  to
independent  wafer  manufacturers.  We  also consider the use of contracts which
commit  us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods.  We
are  currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner.
However, at times we have been unable, and may in the future be unable, to fully
satisfy customer demand because of production constraints, including the ability
of  suppliers  and  subcontractors  to provide materials and services to satisfy
customer  delivery  dates,  as  well  as  our  ability  to  process products for
shipment.  In addition, a significant increase in general industry demand or any
interruption of supply could reduce our supply of wafers or increase our cost of
such wafers.  These events could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

DEPENDENCE  ON  NEW  PRODUCTS

Our  success  depends  in large part on our ability to develop and introduce new
products  which  address  customer  requirements  and compete effectively on the
basis  of  price,  density,  functionality  and performance.  The success of new
product  introductions  is  dependent  upon  several  factors,  including:

  -     timely  completion  of  new  product  designs;
  -     ability  to  utilize  advanced  manufacturing  process  technologies;
  -     achieving  acceptable  yields;
  -     availability  of  supporting  software  design  tools;
  -     utilization  of  predefined  cores  of  logic;
  -     market  acceptance;  and
  -     successful  deployment  of  systems  by  our  customers.

We cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successful or that
our  new  products  will  achieve  market  acceptance.  Revenues relating to our
mature  products are expected to decline in the future.  As a result, we will be
increasingly  dependent  on revenues derived from newer products along with cost
reductions  on  current  products.  We  rely  primarily  on  obtaining  yield
improvements  and  corresponding  cost reductions in the manufacture of existing
products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and
other  price/performance  factors  that  enable  us  to  increase revenues while
maintaining consistent margins.  To the extent that such cost reductions and new
product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our
products  do  not  achieve  market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations could be materially adversely
affected.

COMPETITION

Our  PLDs compete in the logic industry.  The industries in which we compete are
intensely  competitive  and  are  characterized  by  rapid technological change,
product  obsolescence  and  continuous  price  erosion.  We  expect  increased
competition,  both from our primary competitors, Altera Corporation, and Lattice
Semiconductor  Corporation and from a number of new companies that may enter our
market.  We believe that important competitive factors in the programmable logic
industry  include:

  -     product  pricing;
  -     product  performance,  reliability  and  density;
  -     the  adaptability  of  products  to  specific  applications;
  -     ease  of  use  and  functionality  of  software  design  tools;
  -     functionality  of  predefined  cores  of  logic;  and
  -     the  ability  to  provide  timely  customer  service  and  support.

Our  strategy  for expansion in the logic market includes continued introduction
of new product architectures which address high volume, low cost applications as
well  as  high  performance, leading-edge density applications.  In addition, we
anticipate  continued  price  reductions proportionate with our ability to lower
the  manufacturing  cost  for  established products.  However, we cannot provide
assurance  that  we  will  be  successful  in  achieving  these  strategies.

Our  major  sources  of  competition  are  comprised  of  several  elements:

  -     providers of high  density  programmable logic products characterized by
        FPGA-type  architectures;
  -     providers of high  volume and low cost FPGAs as programmable replacement
        for  ASICs  and  application  specific  standard  products  (ASSPs).;
  -     providers  of  high  speed,  low  density  CPLD  devices;
  -     the  manufacturers  of  custom  gate  arrays;
  -     providers  of  competitive  software  development  tools;
  -     other  providers  of  new  or  emerging  programmable  logic  products.

We compete with high density programmable logic suppliers on the basis of device
performance,  the  ability  to  deliver  complete solutions to customers, device
power  consumption  and  customer  support  by  taking  advantage of the primary
characteristics  of  our  PLD product offerings which include: flexibility, high
speed  implementation,  quick  time-to-market  and system level capabilities. We
compete  with  ASIC  manufacturers  on  the basis of lower design costs, shorter
development schedules, reduced inventory risk and field upgradability.  The ASIC
market  segment  has been declining, and ASICs are being replaced by other logic
options.  The  primary  attributes of ASICs are high density, high speed and low
production  costs  in  high  volumes.  We  continue  to  develop  lower  cost
architectures  intended  to narrow the gap between current ASIC production costs
(in  high  volumes) and PLD production costs.  As PLDs have increased in density
and  performance  and  decreased  in  cost  due  to  the  advanced manufacturing
processes,  they  have  become  more  directly competitive with ASICs.  With the
introduction  of  our  Spartan  family,  which is Xilinx's low cost programmable
replacement  for  ASICs,  we  seek  to  grow  by  directly  competing with other
companies  in  the ASIC segment.  Many of the companies in the ASIC segment have
substantially  greater financial, technical and marketing resources than Xilinx.
Consequently,  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in competing
in the ASIC segment. Competition among PLD suppliers and manufacturers of new or
emerging  programmable  logic products is based primarily on price, performance,
design,  customer  support, software utility and the ability to deliver complete
solutions  to  customers.  Some  of  our  current  or potential competitors have
substantially  greater  financial,  manufacturing,  marketing,  distribution and
technical  resources  than we do.  To the extent that our efforts to compete are
not  successful,  our  financial  condition  and  results of operations could be
materially  adversely  affected.

The  benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of companies to this
market.  We recognize that different applications require different programmable
technologies,  and  we  are  developing architectures, processes and products to
meet  these  varying  customer  needs.  Recognizing the increasing importance of
standard software solutions, we have developed common software design tools that
support  the  full  range  of  integrated  circuit  products.  We  believe  that
automation  and  ease  of  design are significant competitive factors in the PLD
segment.

Several  companies,  both large and small, have introduced products that compete
with  ours  or have announced their intention to enter the PLD segment.  Some of
our competitors may possess innovative technology, which could prove superior to
our  technology  in  certain applications.  In addition, we anticipate potential
competition from suppliers of logic products based on new technologies.  Some of
our  current  or  potential  competitors  have  substantially greater financial,
manufacturing,  marketing  and  technical resources than we do.  This additional
competition  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and results of
operations.

We  could  also  face  competition from our licensees.  Under a license from us,
Lucent  Technologies  has  rights  to  manufacture  and  market  our XC3000 FPGA
products and also employ that technology to provide additional high density FPGA
products.  Seiko Epson has rights to manufacture some of our products and market
them  in Japan and Europe, but is not currently doing so.   We granted a license
to  use  certain  of  our patents to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).  AMD produced
certain  programmable  logic devices under that license through its wholly owned
subsidiary,  Vantis.  In  June  1999,  AMD sold the Vantis subsidiary to Lattice
Semiconductor  Corporation.

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY

We  rely  upon  patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our
intellectual  property.  We cannot assure that such intellectual property rights
can  be  successfully  asserted  in  the  future  or  will  not  be invalidated,
circumvented  or  challenged.  From  time  to time, third parties, including our
competitors,  have  asserted  patent,  copyright and other intellectual property
rights  to  technologies  that are important to us.  We cannot assure that third
parties  will  not  assert  infringement  claims  against us in the future, that
assertions  by  third  parties  will  not result in costly litigation or that we
would  prevail  in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed
patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially  reasonable  terms.  Litigation,
regardless  of  its  outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
our  resources.  Any  infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us
could  materially  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results of
operations.  (See  Part II - Other Information, Item 1 - Legal Proceedings for a
discussion  of  litigation  between  Xilinx  and  Altera  Corporation.)

INVESTMENT  COMPANY  ACT  OF  1940

The  Investment  Company  Act  of  1940  regulates  mutual  funds and closed-end
investment companies that are traded on the public stock markets.  The 1940 Act,
and  rules issued under it, contain provisions and set forth principles that are
designed  to differentiate "true" operating companies from companies that may be
considered to have sufficient investment company-like characteristics to require
regulation  by  the  1940 Act's complex procedural and substantive requirements.
These  provisions  apply  to  companies  that own or hold securities, as well as
companies  that invest, reinvest and trade in securities, and particularly focus
on  determining  the primary nature of a company's activities, including whether
an investing company controls and does business through the entities in which it
invests  or, instead, holds its securities investments passively and not as part
of  an  operating  business.

In  January 2000, as a result of USIC's merger with UMC (see Note 7 to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements), we received approximately 222 million shares
of  UMC  stock, which are publicly traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.  We view
this  investment  in UMC as an operating investment primarily intended to secure
adequate  wafer  manufacturing capacity.  However, because of the success of our
investments  during  the  last year, including our strategic wafer manufacturing
investments, at least from the time of the completion of the merger of USIC into
UMC  in  January  2000,  we  believe that we could be viewed as holding a larger
portion  of  our assets in investment securities than is presumptively permitted
by  the  1940  Act  for  a  company  not  registered  as  an investment company.

We  believe  we should not be considered an investment company under the Act and
should  not  be subject to regulation thereunder. We are prepared, if necessary,
to  seek  exemptive  or no-action relief from the SEC.  However, there can be no
assurance  that  the  SEC  will agree.  If the SEC does not concur, we may, as a
result,  be  required  to  divest  ourselves or change the mix of assets that we
consider  strategically  necessary  for  the  conduct  of our operations.   Such
divestitures  could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results
of  operations.

EURO  CURRENCY

Beginning  in  1999, 11 member countries of the European Union established fixed
conversion  rates  between  their  existing sovereign currencies and adopted the
Euro as their common legal currency.  During the three-year transition, the Euro
will  be  available  for non-cash transactions and legacy currencies will remain
legal  tender.  We  are  continuing to assess the Euro's impact on our business.
We are reviewing the ability of our accounting and information systems to handle
the  conversion,  the ability of foreign banks to report on dual currencies, the
legal  and  contractual  implications  of  agreements,  as well as reviewing our
pricing  strategies.  We  expect  that  any  additional  modifications  to  our
operations  and  systems  will be completed on a timely basis and do not believe
the  conversion will have a material adverse impact on our operations.  However,
we  cannot  assure  that  we will be able to successfully modify all systems and
contracts  to  comply  with  Euro  requirements.

LITIGATION

We  are  currently engaged in several legal matters.  See "Legal Proceedings" in
Part  II.


Item  3.          Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  about Market Risk

INTEREST  RATE  RISK

Our  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  relates  primarily  to  our  investment
portfolio.  Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available
cash  while  preserving  principal  and  meeting liquidity needs.  The portfolio
includes  tax-advantaged  municipal bonds, tax-advantaged auction rate preferred
municipal  bonds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities.  In accordance
with  our  investment  policy,  we  place  investments  with high credit quality
issuers  and  limit  the  amount  of  credit  exposure to any one issuer.  These
securities  are  subject  to  interest  rate  risk and will decrease in value if
market  interest  rates increase.  A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates
would not materially affect the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.

FOREIGN  CURRENCY  RISK

We  use  forward  currency  exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks.
Our  sales  to  Japanese customers are denominated in yen while our purchases of
processed  silicon  wafers  from Japanese foundries are primarily denominated in
U.S.  dollars.  Gains  and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are
designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm
commitment  has  been  attained,  are  deferred and included in the basis of the
transaction  in  the  same  period that the underlying transactions are settled.
Gains  and  losses  on  any  instruments not meeting the above criteria would be
recognized  in  income  in  the  current  period.  A  15%  adverse change in yen
exchange  rates  based  on  historical  average rate fluctuations would have had
approximately  a  1.0%  adverse  impact on revenue for the first three months in
fiscal years 2001 and 2000.  We are also sharing the yen exchange rate risk with
some  of  our  Japanese  customers  through risk sharing agreements.  As we will
continue  to  have  a  net  yen exposure in the near future, we will continue to
mitigate  the  exposure  through  yen  hedging  contracts.  However, no currency
forward  contracts  were  outstanding  as  of  July  1,  2000.

Our  investments  in several subsidiaries and in the UMC securities are recorded
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  As these foreign currency denominated
investments  are translated at each month end during consolidation, fluctuations
of  exchange  rates between the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar increase or
decrease the value of those investments.  If permanent changes occur in exchange
rates  after  an  investment  is  made,  the investment's value will increase or
decrease  accordingly.  These  fluctuations  are  recorded  within stockholders'
equity  as  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  Also, as our
subsidiaries  maintain  investments  denominated in other than local currencies,
exchange  rate  fluctuations  will  occur.


PART  II.  OTHER  INFORMATION

Item  1.     Legal  Proceedings

On June 7, 1993, we filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in the United
States  District  Court for the Northern District of California for infringement
of  certain  of  our  patents.  Subsequently,  Altera filed suit against Xilinx,
alleging that certain of our products infringe certain Altera patents.  Fact and
expert  discovery  have  been  completed  in  both  cases,  which  have  been
consolidated.  Both  Altera  and Xilinx filed motions with the Court for summary
judgement  with respect to certain of the issues pending in the litigation.   In
October  1999,  the  Court  ruled  on all but one of the motions. As a result of
those  rulings,  Altera is left with one claim against Xilinx, which remains the
subject  of  a  Company  motion for summary judgment. A ruling on this motion is
pending. The Court's rulings also dismissed certain claims by us, leaving intact
claims of infringement by Altera under two Company patents. The remaining claims
against Altera will be decided at a trial scheduled to begin on October 5, 2000.
If  the remaining claim against Xilinx survives the motion for summary judgment,
it  will  be  decided  at  a  trial,  which  is  unscheduled  at  this  point.

On April 20, 1995, Altera filed an additional suit against Xilinx in the Federal
District  Court in Delaware, alleging that our XC5200 family infringes an Altera
patent.  We  answered the Delaware suit denying that the XC5200 family infringes
the  patent  in suit, asserting certain affirmative defenses and counterclaiming
that  the Altera Max 9000 family infringes certain of our patents.  The Delaware
suit  was  transferred  to  the  United  States  District Court for the Northern
District  of  California.

On  July  22, 1998, Altera and Joseph Ward, a former Xilinx employee, filed suit
against  Xilinx in Superior Court in Santa Clara County, California, arising out
of  our  efforts  to  prevent  disclosure  of  certain  Company  confidential
information.  Altera's  suit  requests  declaratory  relief  and  claims  Xilinx
engages  in  unfair  business  practices  and  interference  with  contractual
relations.  On  September 10, 1998 we filed cross claims against Altera and Ward
for  unfair  competition  and  breach  of  contract,  among other claims, in the
California  action.  On  October  20,  1998,  Altera  and Ward filed crossclaims
against  Xilinx  for  malicious  prosecution  of civil action and defamation. On
September 15, 1999, the Court dismissed all of our claims against Altera and Mr.
Ward, finding that we were unable to show any damages we suffered as a result of
any  actions  by  Mr.  Ward.  Claims  against  Xilinx  are  still  pending.

On  May  31, 2000, Altera filed an additional suit against Xilinx in the Federal
District  Court  for  the Northern District of California, alleging that certain
Xilinx  products,  including  our  Virtex  FPGAs, infringe three Altera patents.
Altera's  suit  requests  unspecified monetary damages as well as issuance of an
injunction  to  prevent Xilinx from selling allegedly infringing parts.   Xilinx
has answered the complaint, denied the allegations, and has filed a counterclaim
alleging  that Altera is infringing additional Company patents.  Altera's motion
for  expedited  discovery  was  denied  by  the  Court.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has  meritorious  defenses to such claims and is
defending them vigorously.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement subject
to risks and uncertainties, and the future outcome of these matters could differ
materially  due to the uncertain nature of each legal proceeding and because the
lawsuits  are  still  in  the  pre-trial  stages.

There  are  no  other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which we
are a party or of which any of our property is the subject.  We know of no legal
proceedings  contemplated  by  any  governmental  authority  or  agency.
