              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.     The  accompanying  interim  consolidated  financial  statements have been
prepared  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and should
be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Xilinx,  Inc.  (Xilinx  or  the  Company)
consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 3, 1999.  The balance
sheet at April 3, 1999 is derived from audited financial statements. The interim
financial  statements are unaudited but reflect all adjustments which are in the
opinion  of management of a normal, recurring nature necessary to present fairly
the  statements  of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the  interim  periods  presented.  The  results  for  the three-month period and
nine-month  period  ended  January 1, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of the
results that may be expected for the year ending April 1, 2000.  The three-month
and  nine-month  periods  ended  January  1,  2000  consisted  of  thirteen  and
thirty-nine  weeks,  respectively.  The three-month and nine-month periods ended
January  2,  1999  consisted  of  thirteen  and  forty  weeks,  respectively.

2.     Inventories  are  stated  at  the  lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market  (estimated  net  realizable  value).  Inventories at January 1, 2000 and
April  3,  1999  are  as  follows:

3.     In  December  1999,  we  exercised our option to purchase three buildings
previously  leased  at  our  San  Jose  corporate  facility.  The  restricted
investment  of  $34.4  million related to certain collateral requirements on the
building  leases  was  used  to  purchase  the  three  buildings.

4.     The  computation of basic net income per share for all years presented is
derived  from  the  information  on the face of the statement of operations, and
there  are  no  reconciling  items  in  either  the  numerator  or  denominator.
Additionally,  there  are  no reconciling items in the numerator used to compute
diluted  net  income per share.  The total shares used in the denominator of the
diluted  net income per share calculation includes 26.3 million and 25.4 million
incremental  common  shares  attributable  to  outstanding options for the third
quarter  and first nine months of fiscal year 2000, respectively, as compared to
14.7  million  and  14.2  million  in  the  comparable  fiscal  1999  periods,
respectively.

Outstanding options to purchase approximately 0.2 million and 0.9 million shares
for  the  third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2000, respectively,
and  3.0  million and 12.8 million shares in the comparable fiscal 1999 periods,
respectively,  under  the  Company's  Stock Option Plan were not included in the
treasury  stock  calculation  to  derive  diluted  net income per share as their
inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.  In addition, the put warrants
disclosed  in  Note 7 did not have any impact on basic or diluted net income per
share  in  the  three  and  nine months ended January 1, 2000 as their inclusion
would  have  had  an  anti-dilutive  effect.

5.     The  components  of  comprehensive  income  for  the three and nine month
periods  ended  January  1,  2000  and  January  2,  1999  are  as  follows:

6.     Xilinx,  United  Microelectronics  Corporation  (UMC)  and  other parties
entered  into  a  joint  venture  to  construct  a wafer fabrication facility in
Taiwan,  known  as United Silicon Inc. (USIC).  We had a 20% equity ownership in
USIC  and  had the right to receive up to 31.25% of the wafer capacity from this
facility.  We  accounted  for  this  investment  using  the  equity  method  of
accounting  with  a  one-month  lag  in  recording  our share of results for the
entity.

In  January  2000,  our equity position in USIC was converted into shares of UMC
which  are  publicly  traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.  We will recognize an
approximate  $400  million  after-tax  gain  in our fiscal fourth quarter ending
April  1,  2000,  as  a  result of the merger of United Silicon Inc. (USIC) with
United  Microelectronics  Corporation  (UMC).  The gain, to be reported as other
income,  represents  the appreciation of our investment in USIC.  As a result of
this  merger, we will own approximately 222 million UMC shares, which represents
2% of the combined UMC Group.  We retain equivalent wafer capacity rights in UMC
as  we  previously had in USIC, as long as we retain one-half of our UMC shares.

Due  to  restrictions  imposed  by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange, we will be
subject  to  a  certain holding period during which time, we will not be able to
sell  our  UMC  shares.

7.     Our  Board  of Directors approved stock repurchase programs that allow us
to  repurchase  shares  of  our  common  stock.  During the first nine months of
fiscal  2000, we repurchased 247,000 shares of common stock under our authorized
repurchase  program  at  a  cost of $5.3 million.  In conjunction with the stock
repurchase  program,  during  the nine months ended January 1, 2000, we sold put
warrants  that  entitle  the  holder  of each warrant to sell to us, by physical
delivery,  one  share  of common stock at a specified price, ranging from $32 to
$42  per  share.  The  outstanding  put  warrants  will  expire at various dates
through  October  2000.  As  of  January  1, 2000, we have 2.2 million shares of
outstanding  put  warrants.

8.     In  June  1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  133,  (FASB  133),  "Accounting  for
Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities",  which  requires adoption in
fiscal  years  beginning after June 15, 2000 while earlier adoption is permitted
at  the  beginning  of  any  fiscal quarter.  We are required to adopt by fiscal
2002.  The  effect  of adopting the Standard is currently being evaluated but is
not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations
or financial position.  FASB 133 will require us to recognize all derivatives on
the  balance  sheet  at  fair  value.  Derivatives  that  are not hedges must be
adjusted  to  fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending
on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will either
be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or
firm  commitments  through  earnings  or  recognized  in  accumulated  other
comprehensive  income  until  the  hedged  item  is recognized in earnings.  The
ineffective  portion,  if  any,  of  a derivative's change in fair value will be
immediately  recognized  in  earnings.

9.     We  completed  the  acquisition  of  Philips  Seminconductors'  line  of
low-power  complex  programmable  logic  devices (CPLDs) on August 2, 1999.  The
total cost, including acquisition related fees, was approximately $22.8 million.
The  purchase  price  allocation based on an independent appraisal resulted in a
$4.6  million  charge  to  research  and development in the second quarter.  The
acquired in-process technology represents the appraised value of technologies in
the  development  stage  that  had not yet reached technological feasibility and
does  not  have  alternative  future  uses.

10.     On  October 18, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a 2 for 1 split of
our  Common  Stock, which was effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend.  On
December  27,  1999, shareholders of record as of December 17, 1999 received one
additional  share  of  Common  Stock  for  every  share held.  Shares, per share
amounts,  common  stock  at  par value, and additional paid-in capital have been
restated  to  reflect  the  stock  split  for  all  periods  presented.


Item  2.     Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations

The  following  discussion  contains  forward-looking  statements, which involve
numerous  risks  and  uncertainties.  Actual  results  may  differ  materially.
Certain  of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under "Factors Affecting
Future  Operating  Results".

RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS:  THIRD  QUARTER  AND  FIRST  NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2000

COMPARED  TO  THE  THIRD  QUARTER  AND  FIRST  NINE  MONTHS  OF  FISCAL  1999

NET  REVENUES

We  currently classify our product offerings into four categories by technology.
Base  products  consist  of  our  mature  product  families  that  are currently
manufactured  on technologies of 0.6 micron and older; this includes the XC2000,
XC3000,  XC3100,  XC4000 and XC7000 families.  Mainstream products are currently
manufactured  on  0.35  and  0.5  micron  technologies  and include the XC4000E,
XC4000EX,  XC4000XL,  XC5200,  XC9500,  XC9500XL, Spartan and CoolRunner product
lines.  Advanced  products  include our newest technologies manufactured on 0.25
micron and smaller, which include the XC4000XV, XC4000XLA, Spartan XL, Spartan2,
Virtex,  and  VirtexE product lines.  Our Support products make up the remainder
of  our  product  offerings  and  include  serial proms, HardWire, and software.

Net revenues of $264.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 represented a
54.0%  increase  from  the  comparable  prior  year  quarter  of $171.6 million.
Revenues  for  the first nine months of fiscal 2000 were $714.4 million, a 49.6%
increase  from the prior year comparable period.  Product lines that experienced
significant growth during the nine-month period include the XC4000XL, XC4000XLA,
XC9500,  Spartan,  and  Virtex  families.  The increases in revenues of Advanced
products  are due to the introduction and strong market acceptance of XC4000XLA,
Spartan  XL  and  Virtex products.  Increases in revenues of Mainstream products
are  attributable  mainly to growth in the XC4000XL, Spartan, and XC9500 product
lines,  along  with  the acquisition of CoolRunner and introduction of XC9500XL.
Revenues  of  Base  products  decreased  as  customers migrated to newer product
offerings  while  revenues  of Support products remain relatively flat.  We have
historically  been  able  to  offset  much of the revenue declines of our mature
technologies  with  increased  revenues  from  newer  technologies,  although no
assurance can be given that we can continue to do so in the future.  The revenue
by  technology  for  the  three and nine month periods ended January 1, 2000 and
January  2,  1999  are  as  follows:

International  revenues  represented  approximately  35.0%,  and  32.8% of total
revenues  in  the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2000 as compared
to  31.2%,  and 32.8% in the prior year periods.  The European revenue increases
are  due  to  several  customer  programs  commencing  production.  The  revenue
increases in Japan are due to wider adoption of our new products in consumer and
telecommunications  applications  as  well as to favorable exchange rates.  Asia
Pacific/Rest  of  World experienced significant increases in revenue as a result
of  economic  recovery  in  those regions following the economic downturn a year
ago.  The  revenue  by  geography  for  the  three  and nine month periods ended
January  1,  2000  and  January  2,  1999  are  as  follows:

GROSS  MARGIN

Gross  margin  was  $164.7  million and $444.9 million for the third quarter and
first  nine  months  of fiscal 2000, respectively, or 62.3% of revenues for both
periods.  Gross  margin  for  the  comparable  periods of fiscal 1999 was $104.5
million,  or  60.9%  of  revenues,  and  $295.5  million,  or 61.9% of revenues,
respectively.  Gross  margin  percentage  increased  slightly  for the three and
nine-month  periods  as  we  continue  to  benefit  from  cost  improvements,
manufacturing  process  technology  advances  and  improved  yields  that offset
selling  price  reductions.  We  recognize that ongoing price reductions for our
integrated  circuits  are  a significant element in expanding the market for our
products.  Management believes that gross margin objectives of approximately 62%
of  revenues  are  consistent  with  expanding  market  share  while  realizing
acceptable returns, although there can be no assurance that future gross margins
can  remain  in  this  range.

RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

Research  and  development expenditures were $31.6 million, or 12.0% of revenues
for  the  third  quarter,  and $86.9 million, or 12.2% of revenues for the first
nine  months  of  fiscal  2000.  Research  and  development expenditures for the
comparable  periods  in  the prior year were $23.0 million and $66.4 million, or
13.4%  and  13.9%  of  revenues,  respectively.  Although  total expenditures on
research and development increased significantly, they decreased as a percent of
revenue  because  of  strong revenue growth.  The 30.9% increase in expenditures
over  the  prior  year's  nine  month  period was primarily due to designing and
developing  new product architectures of complex, high density devices including
wafer  purchases, development of advanced process technologies using 0.22 micron
and  0.18  micron,  software  development,  increased  labor-related  costs, and
testing  of  new  products,  along  with  increased  costs  associated  with the
acquisition  of  the  CPLD  CoolRunner business from Philips Semiconductors.  We
remain  committed  to  a significant level of research and development effort in
order  to maintain our technology leadership in the programmable logic industry.

SALES,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE

Sales,  general  and  administrative  expenses  were  $48.0 million, or 18.1% of
revenues  and  $131.4  million,  or  18.4% of revenues for the third quarter and
first  nine  months  of  fiscal 2000, respectively.  They were $33.9 million, or
19.7%  of  revenues  and  $97.7  million, or 20.5% of revenues in the comparable
prior  year  periods.  Although total sales, general and administrative expenses
increased,  they  decreased  as  a  percent of revenue because of strong revenue
growth.  The  increases  in  sales,  general  and  administrative  expenses were
primarily  attributable  to  increased  marketing  expenses  for  new  product
introductions,  increased  sales  costs  on higher revenues along with increased
personnel  and  facilities  expenses.  We  remain  committed  to  controlling
administrative  expenses.  However,  the timing and extent of future legal costs
associated  with the ongoing enforcement of our intellectual property rights are
not  readily  predictable  and  may  increase  significantly  in  the  future.

INTEREST  AND  OTHER,  NET

Interest and other income, net increased to $7.3 million in the third quarter of
fiscal  2000 from $1.9 million in the prior year third quarter, and increased to
$19.3  million  in the first nine months of fiscal 2000 from $3.4 million in the
prior  year's  comparable  period.  The  increases  were  primarily  due  to the
decrease  in  interest  expense  related  to  the  convertible  notes which were
redeemed  in  the  fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.  In addition, average cash and
investment  balances have increased in both the third quarter and the first nine
months  of  fiscal  2000  as  compared  to  the  prior year periods resulting in
increased  interest  income of $2.9 million and $5.9 million over the respective
prior  year  periods.  The amount of net interest and other income in the future
will  continue  to  be  impacted by the level of our average cash and investment
balance,  prevailing  interest  rates,  and  foreign  currency  exchange  rates.

PROVISION  FOR  INCOME  TAXES

We  recorded  a  tax  provision of $26.8 million and $70.0 million for the third
quarter  and  first nine months of fiscal 2000, representing effective tax rates
of  29.0%  for both periods.  We recorded a provision of $12.6 million and $39.1
million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 1999, representing
effective  tax  rates  of 25.6% and 29.0%, respectively.   The lower tax rate in
the  third  quarter  of fiscal 1999 was primarily due to legislation reinstating
the R&D Tax Credit through June 30, 1999 as well as increased profits in foreign
jurisdictions  where  the  tax  rate  is  lower  than  the  U.S.  rate.

JOINT  VENTURE  EQUITY  INCOME

We  record our proportional ownership of the net income (loss) of United Silicon
Inc.  (USIC),  a  wafer  fabrication  joint  venture located in Taiwan, as joint
venture  equity income (loss).  We recorded $2.9 million and $4.8 million equity
in  income  of  joint venture for the third quarter and the first nine months of
fiscal  2000,  respectively, as compared to $0.7 million and $5.7 million equity
in  loss  of  joint venture in the prior year periods, respectively.  The fiscal
1999  equity  in  loss  of  joint venture was a result of the early stage in the
production  ramp  of  the wafer fabrication facility.  The fiscal 2000 net gains
were  recorded  as  USIC  began  to  have volume wafer production and shipments.

In  January  2000,  our equity position in USIC was converted into shares of UMC
which  are  publicly  traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.  We will recognize an
approximate  $400  million  after-tax  gain  in our fiscal fourth quarter ending
April  1,  2000,  as  a  result of the merger of USIC with UMC.  The gain, to be
reported as other income, represents the appreciation of our investment in USIC.
As  a  result  of this merger, we will own approximately 222 million UMC shares,
which  represents  2%  of  the  combined  UMC Group.  We retain equivalent wafer
capacity  rights  in  UMC  as  we  previously  had in USIC, as long as we retain
one-half  of  our  UMC  shares.

Due  to  restrictions  imposed  by UMC and the Taiwan Stock Exchange, we will be
subject  to  a  certain holding period during which time, we will not be able to
sell  our  UMC  shares.

HEDGING

We  use  forward  currency  exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks.
Our  sales  to  Japanese customers are denominated in yen while our purchases of
processed  silicon  wafers  from Japanese foundries are primarily denominated in
U.S.  dollars.  Gains  and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are
designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm
commitment  has  been  attained,  are  deferred and included in the basis of the
transaction  in  the  same  period that the underlying transactions are settled.
Gains  and  losses  on  any  instruments not meeting the above criteria would be
recognized  in income in the current period.  In fiscal 2000, we have also begun
to  share the yen exchange rate risk with some of our Japanese customers through
risk  sharing agreements.  As we will continue to have a net yen exposure in the
near  future,  we  will  continue  to  mitigate the exposure through yen hedging
contracts.  No  currency  forward  contracts  were  outstanding as of January 1,
2000.

INFLATION

To  date,  the  effects  of  inflation  upon our financial results have not been
significant.


FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES
- ---------------------------------------------------------

Our  financial  condition  at  January  1,  2000 remained strong.  Total current
assets exceeded total current liabilities by 5.0 times, compared to 3.9 times at
April  3,  1999.  We  have  used  a  combination  of  equity  and cash flow from
operations  to  support  on-going  business  activities,  secure  manufacturing
capacity  from  foundry  partners,  make  acquisitions  and  investments  in
complementary  technologies, obtain facilities and capital equipment and finance
inventory  and  accounts  receivable.

We  continued  to  generate positive cash flows from operations during the first
nine  months  of  fiscal  2000.  As  of  January  1,  2000,  we  had  cash, cash
equivalents  and short-term investments of $497.5 million and working capital of
$684.5  million.  Cash  generated  by operations of $223.8 million for the first
nine  months  of  fiscal  2000  was $57.6 million higher than the $166.2 million
generated  from  the  first  nine  months  of  fiscal  1999.  Increases  in cash
generated  by  operations  resulted  primarily  from  the  cash  flow  impact of
increased net income, and increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and
income  taxes  payable,  which  were  partially  offset by increases in accounts
receivable,  inventory,  prepaids for building deposit and decreases in deferred
income  on  shipments  to  distributors.

Cash flows used for investing activities during the nine months ended January 1,
2000  included  net  investment  purchases  of $138.8 million, $91.5 million for
property,  plant  and  equipment  and  $22.8  million  for assets purchased from
Philips'  CPLD business.  During the first nine months of fiscal 1999, investing
activities  included  net  investment purchases of $120.4 million, $28.4 million
of  property,  plant  and  equipment acquisitions and an additional $5.4 million
equity  investment in the USIC joint venture.   We increased our property, plant
and  equipment purchases significantly in the first nine month of fiscal 2000 as
we  purchased  more testers, equipment, and facilities for our growing business.

Net  cash flows provided by financing activities were $56.3 million in the first
nine  months  of  fiscal 2000 and were attributable to $51.5 million in proceeds
from  the  issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $10.1 million
in  proceeds from sales of put warrants, offset by acquisition of treasury stock
of  $5.3 million.  For the comparable fiscal 1999 period, cash used in financing
activities  of  $67.1 million included $108.6 million in acquisition of treasury
stock  partially  offset  by  $41.5  million of proceeds from issuance of common
stock  under  employee  stock  plans.

Stockholders' equity increased by $314.8 million during the first nine months of
fiscal 2000, principally as a result of the $176.1 million in net income for the
nine  months ended January 1, 2000.  In addition, the proceeds from the issuance
of  common  stock  under  employee  stock  plans  of  $51.5 million, related tax
benefits from stock options of $79.4 million, and $10.1 million in proceeds from
sales  of  put warrants contributed to the increase, which were partially offset
by  the  $5.3  million  in  acquisition  of  treasury  stock.

We  have  available  credit  facilities  for  up  to $46.2 million of which $6.2
million  is  intended  to  meet  occasional working capital requirements for our
wholly  owned  Irish  subsidiary.  As  of  January  1,  2000, no borrowings were
outstanding  under  the  lines  of  credit.

We  anticipate  that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations
will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.  We
will  continue  to  evaluate  opportunities to obtain additional wafer capacity,
procure  additional  capital equipment and facilities, develop new products, and
acquire  businesses,  products  or  technologies  that  would  complement  our
businesses  and  may  use  available  cash  or other sources of funding for such
purposes.


FACTORS  AFFECTING  FUTURE  OPERATING  RESULTS
- ----------------------------------------------

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized  by  rapid technological change,
intense  competition and cyclical market patterns.  Cyclical market patterns are
characterized  by  several  factors,  including:

  -     reduced  product  demand;
  -     limited  visibility  of  demand  for  products  beyond  three  months;
  -     accelerated  erosion  of  average  selling  prices;  and
  -     tight  capacity  availability.

Our results of operations are affected by several factors. These factors include
general  economic conditions, conditions specific to technology companies and to
the  semiconductor  industry  in particular, decreases in average selling prices
over the life of particular products and the timing of new product introductions
(by us, our competitors and others.)  In addition, our results of operations are
affected  by the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product
in a timely manner, the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies,
the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors, the
impact  of  new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some
products  in  the  face  of equally steep declines in demand for others, and the
inability  to  predict  the success of our customers' products in their markets.
Market demand for our products, particularly for those most recently introduced,
can  be  difficult  to  predict,  especially  in  light of customers' demands to
shorten  product lead times and minimize inventory levels.  Unpredictable market
demand  could lead to revenue volatility if we were unable to provide sufficient
quantities of specified products in a given quarter. In addition, any difficulty
in  achieving  targeted  wafer  production  yields  could  adversely  affect our
financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to identify changes in
market  conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market make
prediction  of  and  timely reaction to such events difficult.  Due to these and
other  factors,  our past results, including those described in this report, are
much  less  reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older,
more  stable and less dynamic industries.  Based on the factors noted herein, we
may  experience  substantial  period-to-period  fluctuations in future operating
results.

Our  future  success depends in a large part on the continued service of our key
technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel  and on our ability to
continue  to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly important are
those  highly  skilled  design, process, software and test engineers involved in
the  manufacture  of  existing  products and the development of new products and
processes.  The  competition  for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key
employees  could  have  a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results  of  operations.

Sales  and  operations  outside  of  the  United  States subject us to the risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.  Our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could be
adversely  affected  by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we
do  significant  business  and  by  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates
affecting  those  countries.  For  example,  we  have  sales  and  operations in
Southeast  Asia  and  Japan.  Past  economic weakness in these markets adversely
affected  revenues,  and such conditions may occur in the future.  Customers may
face  reduced  access  to  capital  and exchange rate fluctuations may adversely
affect their ability to purchase our products.  In addition, our ability to sell
at  competitive  prices  may  be  diminished.  Currency instability may increase
credit  risks  as the weak currencies may impair our customers' ability to repay
existing  obligations.  Any  or  all of these factors could adversely affect our
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  in  the  near  future.

Our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations are becoming increasingly
dependent  on  a  global  economy.  Any  instability  in  worldwide  economic
environments  could lead to a contraction of capital spending.  Additional risks
to  us include government regulation of exports, imposition of tariffs and other
potential trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in
some countries and generally longer receivable collection periods.  Our business
is  also  subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and
regulations  relating  specifically  to  the  import  or export of semiconductor
products.  We  cannot  predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or
restrictions  will  be  imposed by the United States or other countries upon the
import  or  export  of  our  products in the future or what effect, if any, such
actions  would  have  on  our  financial  condition  and  results of operations.

Our  foundry  partners  in  Taiwan  and  Japan  and  many  of  our operations in
California  are  centered  in  areas  that  have  been  seismically  active,  as
demonstrated by the earthquakes that occurred in Taiwan during the fall of 1999.
Those  earthquakes disrupted manufacturing activities at our foundry partner for
approximately  10  days.  Should  there  be  a major earthquake in our operating
locations  in  the  future, our operations may again be disrupted.  This type of
disruption  could  result  in our inability to ship products in a timely manner,
thereby  materially  adversely  affecting our financial condition and results of
operations.

The  securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject
to  extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market
price  of  our  common  stock.

DEPENDENCE  UPON  INDEPENDENT  MANUFACTURERS  AND  SUBCONTRACTORS

We do not manufacture the wafers used for our products.  During the past several
years,  most  of  our  wafers  have  been  manufactured  by  UMC and Seiko Epson
Corporation  (Seiko),  with  recent  wafers  also  manufactured by USIC.  We are
dependent  upon  these  suppliers  and others to produce wafers with competitive
performance  and  cost  attributes  which  include  transitioning  to  advanced
manufacturing  process  technologies,  producing wafers at acceptable yields and
delivering  them in a timely manner.  While the timeliness, yield and quality of
wafer  deliveries  have  met our requirements to date, we cannot assure that our
wafer  suppliers  will  not  experience future manufacturing problems, including
delays  in  the  realization  of  advanced  manufacturing  process technologies.
Additionally,  disruption  of  operations  at  these  foundries  for any reason,
including  natural  disasters  such as fires, floods, or earthquakes, as well as
disruptions  to access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water
could  cause  delays  in  shipments  of  our products, and could have a material
adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  We  are  also  dependent  on
subcontractors  to  provide  semiconductor  assembly  services.  Any  prolonged
inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and
cost  attributes,  adequate yields or timely delivery, or any other circumstance
that  would  require  us  to  seek  alternative  sources  of supply, could delay
shipments  and  have  a  material  adverse effect on our financial condition and
results  of  operations.

Our growth will depend in large part upon our ability to obtain additional wafer
fabrication  capacity  and  assembly  services  from  suppliers  that  are  cost
competitive.  We  consider  various  alternatives  in order to secure additional
wafer  capacity.  These  alternatives  include,  without  limitation,  equity
investments  in,  or  loans,  deposits,  or  other  financial  commitments  to
independent  wafer  manufacturers.  We  also consider the use of contracts which
commit  us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods.  We
are  currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner.
However, at times we have been unable, and may in the future be unable, to fully
satisfy customer demand because of production constraints, including the ability
of  suppliers  and  subcontractors  to provide materials and services to satisfy
customer  delivery  dates,  as  well  as  our  ability  to  process products for
shipment.  In addition, a significant increase in general industry demand or any
interruption of supply could reduce our supply of wafers or increase our cost of
such wafers.  These events could have a material adverse affect on our financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

DEPENDENCE  ON  NEW  PRODUCTS

Our  success  depends in large part on our ability to develop and introduce on a
timely  basis  new  products  which  address  customer  requirements and compete
effectively  on the basis of price, density, functionality and performance.  The
success  of  new  product  introductions  is  dependent  upon  several  factors,
including:

  -     timely  completion  of  new  product  designs;
  -     ability  to  utilize  advanced  manufacturing  process  technologies;
  -     achieving  acceptable  yields;
  -     availability  of  supporting  software  design  tools;
  -     utilization  of  predefined  cores  of  logic;
  -     market  acceptance;  and
  -     successful  deployment  of  systems  by  our  customers.

We cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successful or that
our  new  products  will  achieve  market  acceptance.  Revenues relating to our
mature  products are expected to decline in the future.  As a result, we will be
increasingly  dependent  on revenues derived from newer products along with cost
reductions  on  current  products.  We  rely  primarily  on  obtaining  yield
improvements  and  corresponding  cost reductions in the manufacture of existing
products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and
other  price/performance  factors  that  enable  us  to  increase revenues while
maintaining consistent margins.  To the extent that such cost reductions and new
product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our
products  do  not  achieve  market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations could be materially adversely
affected.

COMPETITION

Our  FPGAs  and CPLDs compete in the logic industry, with a substantial majority
of our revenues derived from our FPGA product families.  The industries in which
we  compete  are  intensely  competitive  and  are  characterized  by  rapid
technological  change,  product  obsolescence  and continuous price erosion.  We
expect  increased  competition, both from existing competitors and from a number
of  new  companies that may enter our market segment.  We believe that important
competitive  factors  in  the  programmable  logic  business  include:

  -     product  pricing;
  -     product  performance,  reliability  and  density;
  -     the  adaptability  of  products  to  specific  applications;
  -     ease  of  use  and  functionality  of  software  design  tools;
  -     functionality  of  predefined  cores  of  logic;  and
  -     the  ability  to  provide  timely  customer  service  and  support.

Our  strategy  for  expanding  the  market  for  the programmable logic industry
includes  continued introduction of new product architectures which address high
volume,  low cost applications as well as high performance, leading-edge density
applications.  In  addition,  we  would  anticipate  continued  price reductions
proportionate  with our ability to lower the cost of manufacture for established
products.  However,  we  cannot  assure  that we will be successful in achieving
these  strategies.  Our  major  sources  of competition are comprised of several
elements:

  -     the manufacturers of ASIC devices, including custom CMOS gate arrays and
        standard  cells;
  -     providers of high  density  programmable logic products characterized by
        FPGA-type  architectures;
  -     providers  of  high  speed,  low  density  CPLD  devices;  and
  -     other providers  of new  or  emerging  programmable  logic  products and
        processors.

We  compete  with  custom  gate array manufacturers on the basis of lower design
costs,  shorter  development  schedules,  reduced  inventory  risks  and  field
upgradability.  The  CMOS  gate array market has been declining, and gate arrays
are  being  replaced  by other logic options.   The primary attributes of custom
gate  arrays  are  high  density,  high  speed  and low production costs in high
volumes.  We continue to develop lower cost architectures intended to narrow the
gap between current custom gate array production costs (in high volumes) and PLD
production  costs.  We compete with high density programmable logic suppliers on
the  basis  of  performance,  the  ability  to  deliver  complete  solutions  to
customers,  voltage  and  customer  support  by  taking advantage of the primary
characteristics  of  our  PLD product offerings which include: flexibility, high
speed  implementation,  quick  time-to-market  and  system  level  capabilities.
Competition  among  CPLD  suppliers  and  manufacturers  of  new  or  emerging
programmable  logic  products  is based primarily on price, performance, design,
customer support, software utility and the ability to deliver complete solutions
to  customers.  Some  of our current or potential competitors have substantially
greater  financial, manufacturing, marketing and technical resources than we do.
To  the  extent  that  our  efforts to compete are not successful, our financial
condition  and  results  of  operations  could be materially adversely affected.

The  benefits  of  programmable  logic  have  attracted a number of competitors.
Competition  is  based  primarily  on  density, speed, design, price or software
utility.  We  recognize  that  different  applications  require  different
programmable  technologies,  and  we are developing architectures, processes and
products  to  meet  these  varying  customer  needs.  Recognizing the increasing
importance  of  standard  software  solutions, we have developed common software
design  tools  that  support  the full range of integrated circuit products.  We
believe  that  automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors
in  the  programmable  logic  industry.

Several  companies,  both large and small, have introduced products that compete
with  ours or have announced their intention to enter this market segment.  Some
of our competitors may possess innovative technology, which could prove superior
to our technology in certain applications.  In addition, we anticipate potential
competition from suppliers of logic products based on new technologies.  Some of
our  current  or  potential  competitors  have  substantially greater financial,
manufacturing,  marketing  and  technical  resources than we do. This additional
competition  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and results of
operations.

We  could  also  face  competition from our licensees.  Under a license from us,
Lucent  Technologies  is  manufacturing and marketing our non-proprietary XC3000
FPGA  products  and  is  employing  that  technology  to provide additional FPGA
products  offering  higher  density.  Seiko has rights to manufacture certain of
our products and market them in Japan and Europe, but is not currently doing so.
We  granted  a  license  to use certain of our patents to Advanced Micro Devices
("AMD").  AMD  produced  certain  programmable  logic devices under that license
through  its  wholly-owned subsidiary, Vantis.  During 1999, AMD sold the Vantis
subsidiary  to  Lattice  Semiconductor.

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY

We  rely  upon  patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our
intellectual  property.  We cannot assure that such intellectual property rights
can  be  successfully  asserted  in  the  future  or  will  not  be invalidated,
circumvented  or  challenged.  From  time  to time, third parties, including our
competitors,  have  asserted  patent,  copyright and other intellectual property
rights  to  technologies  that are important to us.  We cannot assure that third
parties  will  not  assert  infringement  claims  against us in the future, that
assertions  by  third  parties  will  not result in costly litigation or that we
would  prevail  in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed
patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially  reasonable  terms.  Litigation,
regardless  of  its  outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
our  resources.  Any  infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us
could  materially  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results of
operations.  See  Part  II - Other Information, Item 1 - Legal Proceedings for a
discussion  of  litigation  between  Xilinx  and  Altera  Corporation.

COMPUTER  INFORMATION  SYSTEMS

In  order  to  compete  effectively  in  an  industry  characterized  by  rapid
technological  change,  intense  competition  and  cyclical  market patterns, we
continually  evaluate  our  computer  information systems.  As a result, we have
recently  implemented  new  computer  information systems or system enhancements
relating to our semiconductor manufacturing, software manufacturing, order entry
processing  and  financial  applications.

Like  most  other  companies  using  computer  information  systems  in  their
operations,  we  worked  over  the  past  several  years  on  resolutions to the
potential  impact  of  the  Year  2000  on  the  processing  of  date-sensitive
information  by  our computerized information systems, as well as the vendor and
customer  date-sensitive  computerized information electronically transferred to
us.  The  Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using
two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable Year.  Any of our systems
that have time-sensitive software could have recognized a year ending in "00" as
1900  rather  than  the year 2000, which could have resulted in miscalculations,
classification  errors  or  system  failures.

During  the  past  several years, we performed a thorough review of our internal
use  software  and  hardware  applications  and  software  products  in order to
identify  those applications and products that were not Year 2000 compliant.  We
have  encountered  no  Year  2000  problems with any of our software or hardware
applications or hardware products to date.  Currently, our Year 2000 efforts are
focused  on  ongoing  monitoring  of  these applications.  We will continue this
monitoring  over  the  next  several  months  in  addition to our normal systems
maintenance.  In  addition,  we  have  already  tested  all  of  our systems for
February  29  but  will  continue  to monitor them and other dates that may pose
greater systems risks during this year.  We have also not encountered any supply
disruptions  from any vendors to date.  While we have encountered no problems to
date,  we  cannot  assure  that  no  Year  2000  issues  will  occur.

We believe that our software releases beginning with version M1.5i and including
version  M2.1i  which we started shipping in July 1999, are Year 2000 compliant,
although  we cannot assure that they are Year 2000 compliant.   We have received
no  indications  from customers that these versions are not Year 2000 compliant.
However,  some  of  our customers are running product versions that are not Year
2000  compliant.  We  have  been  encouraging  such  customers to migrate to the
current  product  version.

The  costs  directed  solely towards Year 2000 compliance are not incremental to
us, but rather represent a reallocation of existing resources.  To date, we have
incurred  less  than  $1.5  million on efforts directed solely towards Year 2000
compliance  and  expect  to  incur a total of no more than $2.0 million when the
process is completed, although we cannot assure that this will be the case.  The
costs  of  addressing  potential  problems  are not currently expected to have a
material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows  in  future  periods.  If,  however,  we,  our  customers or vendors incur
problems  currently  unforeseen  and  which  cannot  be  resolved  on  a timely,
cost-effective basis, our financial condition and results of operations could be
adversely  affected.

EURO  CURRENCY

Beginning  in  1999, 11 member countries of the European Union established fixed
conversion  rates  between  their  existing sovereign currencies and adopted the
Euro as their common legal currency.  During the three-year transition, the Euro
will  be  available  for non-cash transactions and legacy currencies will remain
legal  tender.  We  are  continuing to assess the Euro's impact on our business.
We are reviewing the ability of our accounting and information systems to handle
the  conversion,  the ability of foreign banks to report on dual currencies, the
legal  and  contractual  implications  of  agreements,  as well as reviewing our
pricing  strategies.  We  expect  that  any  additional  modifications  to  our
operations  and  systems  will be completed on a timely basis and do not believe
the  conversion will have a material adverse impact on our operations.  However,
we  cannot  assure  that  we will be able to successfully modify all systems and
contracts  to  comply  with  Euro  requirements.

LITIGATION

We  are  currently engaged in several legal matters.  See "Legal Proceedings" in
Part  II.


Item  3.   Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  about Market Risk

INTEREST  RATE  RISK

Our  exposure  to  interest  rate  risk  relates  primarily  to  our  investment
portfolio.  Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available
cash  while  preserving  principal  and  meeting liquidity needs.  The portfolio
includes  tax-advantaged  municipal bonds, tax-advantaged auction rate preferred
municipal  bonds,  certificates  of  deposit,  and U.S. Treasury securities.  In
accordance  with  our  investment  policy, we place investments with high credit
quality  issuers  and  limit  the  amount  of credit exposure to any one issuer.
These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if
market  interest  rates increase.  A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates
would not materially affect the fair value of our available-for-sale securities.

FOREIGN  CURRENCY  RISK

We  use  forward  currency  exchange contracts to reduce financial market risks.
Our  sales  to  Japanese customers are denominated in yen while our purchases of
processed  silicon  wafers  from Japanese foundries are primarily denominated in
U.S.  dollars.  Gains  and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are
designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions, for which a firm
commitment  has  been  attained,  are  deferred and included in the basis of the
transaction  in  the  same  period that the underlying transactions are settled.
Gains  and  losses  on  any  instruments not meeting the above criteria would be
recognized  in  income  in  the  current  period.  A  15%  adverse change in yen
exchange  rates  based  on  historical  average rate fluctuations would have had
approximately  a  1.0%  adverse  impact  on revenue for the nine months ended in
fiscal  years  2000  and  1999.

We  have several subsidiaries and an equity investment in the USIC joint venture
whose  financial  statements  are  recorded  in  currencies  other than the U.S.
dollar.  As  these  foreign currency financial statements are translated at each
month  end  during  consolidation,  fluctuations  of  exchange rates between the
foreign  currency  and  the  U.S. dollar increase or decrease the value of those
investments.  If  permanent  changes occur in exchange rates after an investment
is  made,  the  investment's value will increase or decrease accordingly.  These
fluctuations  are recorded as a component of stockholders' equity as a component
of  accumulated other comprehensive income.  To date, the USIC joint venture has
recorded  $13.4 million in cumulative translation adjustments, as the New Taiwan
dollar  has  decreased  in  value  against  the  U.S.  dollar.  Also,  as  our
subsidiaries  and  the  USIC  joint  venture maintain investments denominated in
other  than  local  currencies,  exchange  rate  fluctuations  will  occur.


PART  II.  OTHER  INFORMATION

Item  1.     Legal  Proceedings

On June 7, 1993, we filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in the United
States  District  Court for the Northern District of California for infringement
of  certain  of  our  patents.  Subsequently,  Altera filed suit against Xilinx,
alleging that certain of our products infringe certain Altera patents.  Fact and
expert  discovery  have  been  completed  in  both  cases,  which  have  been
consolidated.  On April 20, 1995, Altera filed an additional suit against Xilinx
in  the  Federal  District  Court  in  Delaware, alleging that our XC5200 family
infringes  an  Altera  patent.  We  answered  the Delaware suit denying that the
XC5200  family  infringes  the  patent  in  suit,  asserting certain affirmative
defenses  and  counterclaiming that the Altera Max 9000 family infringes certain
of our patents.  The Delaware suit was transferred to the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California and is also before the same judge.
Both  Altera  and Xilinx filed motions with the Court for summary judgement with
respect  to  certain of the issues pending in the litigation.   In October 1999,
the  Court  ruled  on  all but one of the motions. As a result of those rulings,
Altera is left with one claim against Xilinx. The Court's rulings also dismissed
certain  claims  by  us, leaving intact claims of infringement under two Company
patents  by  Altera.  The  remaining  claims against Altera will be decided at a
trial scheduled to begin on May 8, 2000. The remaining claim against Xilinx will
be  decided  at  a  trial  scheduled  to  commence  on  June  19,  2000.

On  July  22, 1998, Altera and Joseph Ward, a former Xilinx employee, filed suit
against  Xilinx in Superior Court in Santa Clara County, California, arising out
of  our  efforts  to  prevent  disclosure  of  certain  Company  confidential
information.  Altera's  suit  requests  declaratory  relief  and  claims  Xilinx
engages  in  unfair  business  practices  and  interference  with  contractual
relations.  On  September 10, 1998 we filed cross claims against Altera and Ward
for  unfair  competition  and  breach  of  contract,  among other claims, in the
California  action.  On  October  20,  1998,  Altera  and Ward filed crossclaims
against  Xilinx  for  malicious  prosecution  of civil action and defamation. On
September 15, 1999, the Court dismissed all of our claims against Altera and Mr.
Ward, finding that we were unable to show any damages we suffered as a result of
Mr.  Ward's  move  to  Altera.  Claims  against  Xilinx  are  still  pending.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has  meritorious  defenses to such claims and is
defending them vigorously.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement subject
to risks and uncertainties, and the future outcome of these matters could differ
materially  due to the uncertain nature of each legal proceeding and because the
lawsuits  are  still  in  the  pre-trial  stages.

There is no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which we are
a  party  or  of  which any of our property is the subject.  We know of no legal
proceedings  contemplated  by  any  governmental  authority  or  agency.


Item  4.     Submission  of  Matters  to  a  Vote  of  Security  Holders

During a special meeting held on December 16, 1999, Xilinx shareholders voted to
approve  an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number
of  authorized  shares  of  our  common  stock,  $0.01 par value per share, from
300,000,000  to  500,000,000  to accommodate a proposed two-for-one split of our
common  stock.

Item  6.     Exhibits  and  Reports  on  Form  8-K.

 (a)    Exhibits    None

 (b)    Reports on Form 8-K

        1)  On December 27, 1999, Xilinx  filed a report on Form 8-K relating
to  the amendment of the Company's certificate of incorporation to increase
the number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock, $0.01 par value
per share, from 300,000,000 to 500,000,000.


Items  2,  3  and  5  are  not  applicable  and  have  been  omitted.
