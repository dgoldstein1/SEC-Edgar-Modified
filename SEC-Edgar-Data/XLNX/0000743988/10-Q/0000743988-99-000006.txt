              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


1.     The  accompanying  interim  consolidated  financial  statements have been
prepared  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and should
be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Xilinx,  Inc.  (Xilinx  or  the  Company)
consolidated financial statements for the year ended April 3, 1999.  The balance
sheet at April 3, 1999 is derived from audited financial statements. The interim
financial  statements are unaudited but reflect all adjustments which are in the
opinion  of management of a normal, recurring nature necessary to present fairly
the  statements  of financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
the  interim  periods  presented.  The  results for the three-month period ended
July  3, 1999 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for  the  year  ending  April  1,  2000.

2.     Inventories  are  stated  at  the  lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market  (estimated net realizable value).  Inventories at July 3, 1999 and April
3,  1999  are  as  follows:

3.     The  computation  of  basic  net  income  (loss)  per share for all years
presented  is  derived  from  the  information  on  the face of the statement of
operations,  and  there  are  no  reconciling  items  in either the numerator or
denominator.  Additionally, there are no reconciling items in the numerator used
to  compute  diluted  net income (loss) per share.  The total shares used in the
denominator of the diluted net income (loss) per share calculation includes 11.5
million  and  8.0  million incremental common shares attributable to outstanding
options  for  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year 2000 and 1999, respectively.

Outstanding options to purchase approximately 0.2 million and 6.1 million shares
for  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal year 2000 and 1999, respectively, under the
Company's  Stock Option Plan were not included in the treasury stock calculation
to  derive diluted net income (loss) per share as their inclusion would have had
an  anti-dilutive  effect.

5.     The  Company  is currently involved in litigation with Altera Corporation
and  other  parties  (see  Part  II,  Item  1,  Legal  Proceedings).  Due to the
uncertain  nature  of the various legal proceedings and because the lawsuits are
still  in  the  pre-discovery  or pre-trial stage, the ultimate outcome of these
matters  cannot  be  determined  at  this  time.

6.     The  Company, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and other parties
have  entered  into a joint venture to construct a wafer fabrication facility in
Taiwan,  known  as  United  Silicon  Inc.  (USIC).  The  Company  has 20% equity
ownership  in  USIC  and  has  the  right  to  receive up to 31.25% of the wafer
capacity  from  this  facility.  The  Company  is accounting for this investment
using  the  equity  method  of  accounting with a one-month lag in recording the
Company's  share  of  results  for  the  entity.

In  June  1999,  the  Company  was  informed  by  UMC Group that Xilinx's equity
position  in USIC will be converted into shares of UMC which are publicly traded
on  the  Taiwan  Stock  Exchange.  The  transaction  is expected to be completed
during  fiscal  2000,  and we cannot currently predict the value or liquidity of
the  UMC  shares  Xilinx  will  obtain  following  the  merger,  if consummated.

7.     From  1997  to 1999, the Board of Directors of the Company approved stock
repurchase  programs  that  allow the Company to repurchase shares of its common
stock.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company repurchased 124,000
shares  of  common  stock under the Company's authorized repurchase program at a
cost  of $5.3 million.  In conjunction with the stock repurchase program, during
the  quarter  ended July 3, 1999, the Company sold put warrants that entitle the
holder  of  each warrant to sell to the Company, by physical delivery, one share
of  common  stock  at a specified price, ranging from $52 to $56 per share.  The
outstanding  put warrants are exercisable only on their maturity date of October
25,  1999.

The put warrants have been classified separately on the balance sheet to reflect
the  maximum  potential obligation of the Company of $13.5 million as of July 3,
1999.  There  was  no impact on basic and diluted net income per share resulting
from  these  transactions  in  the  three  months  ended  July  3,  1999.

8.     In  the first quarter of fiscal 2000, Xilinx signed a letter of intent to
acquire  Philips  Semiconductors'  line  of low-power complex programmable logic
devices  (CPLDs).  The acquisition was completed in the second quarter of fiscal
2000.


Item  2.     Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis  of Financial Condition and
Results  of  Operations


The  following  discussion  contains  forward-looking  statements, which involve
numerous  risks  and  uncertainties.  Actual  results  may  differ  materially.
Certain  of these risks and uncertainties are discussed under "Factors Affecting
Future  Operating  Results".


RESULTS  OF  OPERATIONS:  FIRST  QUARTER  OF  FISCAL  2000 COMPARED TO THE FIRST
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUARTER  OF  FISCAL  1999
- -------------------------

NET  REVENUES

Net revenues of $211.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 represented a
41.4%  increase  from  the  comparable  prior  year  quarter  of $149.5 million.
Product  lines  that  experienced  significant  growth  include  the  XC4000XL,
XC4000XLA,  XC9500,  Spartan,  and  Virtex families.  The increase was partially
offset  by decreased revenues relating to the Company's mature XC4000 and XC3000
families.

The  Company  currently  classifies  its product offerings into four categories.
Base  products  consist  of  the  Company's  mature  product  families  that are
currently  manufactured  on  technologies greater than 0.5 micron; this includes
the XC2000, XC3000, XC3100, XC4000 and XC7000 families.  Mainstream products are
currently  manufactured  on  0.5  micron  technology  and  include  the XC4000E,
XC4000EX,  XC5200  and  XC9500  product  lines.  Advanced  products  include the
Company's  newest  technologies  manufactured  on 0.35 micron and smaller, which
include  the  XC4000XL,  XC4000XV,  XC4000XLA,  XC9500XL,  Virtex,  Spartan  and
SpartanXL  product  lines.  The Company's Support products make up the remainder
of  its  product  offerings  and  include  serial proms, HardWire, and software.
Revenues of Advanced products increased to $80.2 million in the first quarter of
fiscal  2000 from $24.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 and revenues
of  Mainstream products increased to $79.0 million from $65.6 million.  This was
the  first  quarter  that Advanced product revenues surpassed Mainstream product
revenues.  During the same periods, revenues of Base products decreased to $31.8
million  from  $41.5 million and revenues of Support products increased to $20.4
million  from  $18.0  million.  The Company has historically been able to offset
much  of the revenue declines of its mature technologies with increased revenues
from newer technologies, although no assurance can be given that the Company can
continue  to  do  so  in  the  future.

International  revenues represented approximately 30.8% of total revenues in the
first quarter of fiscal 2000 and 36.1% in the prior year quarter.  International
revenues  are  derived  from customers in Europe, Japan and Asia Pacific/Rest of
World.   Revenues  during  the  first  quarter of fiscal 2000 as compared to the
first  quarter  of fiscal 1999 from Europe increased to $39.6 million from $35.4
million,  Japan  increased  to  $14.6  million  from  $12.7  million,  and  Asia
Pacific/Rest  of  World reached a record of $10.9 million from $5.8 million.
Asia  Pacific/Rest  of  World  experienced  85.9%  revenue increase in the first
quarter of fiscal 2000 as compared to the same quarter a year ago primarily as a
result  of  the  stronger  economic environment in those regions following the
economic  turmoil of a  year  ago.

GROSS  MARGIN

Gross  margin  was $131.6 million, or 62.3% of revenues for the first quarter of
fiscal  2000  as  compared to $93.3 million, or 62.4% of revenues, for the first
quarter  of  fiscal  1999.  During  the  first  three months of fiscal 2000, the
Company  continued  to  experience  high  margins  from  manufacturing  process
technology improvements and improved yields that offset continued selling price
reductions.  The  Company  recognizes  that  ongoing  price  reductions  for its
integrated  circuits  are  a significant element in expanding the market for its
products.  Management  believes that gross margin objectives in the range of 60%
to  62%  of  revenues are consistent with expanding market share while realizing
acceptable returns, although there can be no assurance that future gross margins
can  remain  in  this  range.

RESEARCH  AND  DEVELOPMENT

Research  and  development expenditures were $26.0 million, or 12.3% of revenues
for  the first quarter of fiscal 2000, as compared to $20.8 million, or 13.9% of
revenues,  for the first quarter of fiscal 1999.  Although total expenditures on
research and development increased significantly, they decreased as a percent of
revenue  because  of  strong revenue growth.  The 25.0% increase in expenditures
over  the  prior  year  period  was associated with designing and developing new
product  architectures  of  complex,  high  density  devices  including  wafer
purchases,  software  development, increased labor-related costs, and testing of
new  products.  The Company remains committed to a significant level of research
and  development  effort  in  order  to  continue  to  maintain  its  technology
leadership  in  the  programmable  logic  marketplace.

SALES,  GENERAL  AND  ADMINISTRATIVE

Sales,  general  and  administrative  expenses  were  $39.5 million, or 18.7% of
revenues  for  the first quarter of fiscal 2000 as compared to $31.4 million, or
21.0%  of  revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 1999.  Although total sales,
general  and  administrative  expenses increased, they decreased as a percent of
revenue  because of strong revenue growth.  The 25.8% increase in sales, general
and  administrative  expenses  was primarily attributable to increased marketing
expenses  for  new  product introductions, increased sales commissions on higher
revenues  from U.S. distributors along with increased personnel and legal costs.
The  Company remains committed to controlling administration expenses.  However,
the  timing  and  extent  of  future  legal  costs  associated  with the ongoing
enforcement  of  the  Company's  intellectual  property  rights  are not readily
predictable  and  may  significantly  increase  the  level of sales, general and
administrative  expenses  in  the  future.

INTEREST  AND  OTHER,  NET

Interest  and  other  income, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 increased
$5.3 million from the first quarter of fiscal 1999 primarily due to the decrease
in  interest expense related to the convertible notes which were redeemed in the
fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  1999  and net foreign exchange gains.  In addition,
average cash and investment balances have increased in the first three months of
fiscal 2000 as compared to the prior year period resulting in increased interest
income  of  $1.4  million.  The  amount  of net interest and other income in the
future  will  continue to be impacted by the level of the Company's average cash
and investment balance, prevailing interest rates, and foreign currency exchange
rates.

PROVISION  FOR  INCOME  TAXES

The  company  recorded a tax provision of $20.8 million for the first quarter of
fiscal  2000  as  compared  to  $12.9  million  in  the  same prior year period,
representing  effective  tax  rates of 29.0% and 31.0%, respectively.  The lower
tax  rate  is primarily due to increased profits in foreign operations where the
tax  rate  is  lower  than  the  U.S.  rate.

JOINT  VENTURE  EQUITY  INCOME

The  Company  records  its  proportional  ownership  of the net income (loss) of
United Silicon Inc. (USIC), a wafer fabrication joint venture located in Taiwan,
as joint venture equity income (loss).  The Company recorded $0.7 million equity
in  income  of joint venture for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 as compared to
$2.6  million  net losses for the first quarter of fiscal 1999.  The fiscal 1999
net  losses  were  a  result  of  the  continued ramp in production of the wafer
fabrication  facility.  The  fiscal 2000 net gains are recorded as USIC began to
have  volume  wafer  production  and  shipments.

HEDGING

The  Company uses forward currency exchange contracts to reduce financial market
risks.  The  Company's  sales to Japanese customers are denominated in yen while
its  purchases of processed silicon wafers from Japanese foundries are primarily
denominated  in  U.S.  dollars.  Gains  and  losses  on foreign currency forward
contracts  that  are  designated  and  effective  as  hedges  of  anticipated
transactions,  for  which  a firm commitment has been attained, are deferred and
included  in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying
transactions  are  settled.  Gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the
above  criteria  would be recognized in income in the current period.  In fiscal
2000,  the  Company has also begun to share the yen exchange rate risk with some
of  its Japanese customers through risk sharing agreements.  As the Company will
continue  to  have  a  net  yen exposure in the near future, it will continue to
mitigate  the  exposure through yen hedging contracts.  In addition, the Company
does  not  expect  that hedging instruments outstanding as of July 3, 1999, will
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  future  results  of  operations.

INFLATION

To  date, the effects of inflation upon the Company's financial results have not
been  significant.


FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  LIQUIDITY  AND  CAPITAL  RESOURCES
- ---------------------------------------------------------

The  Company's  financial  condition  at  July  3,  1999 remained strong.  Total
current  assets exceeded total current liabilities by 4.0 times, compared to 3.9
times  at  April 3, 1999.  The Company has used a combination of equity and debt
financing and cash flow from operations to support on-going business activities,
secure  manufacturing  capacity  from  foundry  partners,  make acquisitions and
investments  in  complementary  technologies,  obtain  facilities  and  capital
equipment  and  finance  inventory  and  accounts  receivable.

The Company continued to generate positive cash flows from operations during the
first  three  months  of fiscal 2000.  As of July 3, 1999, the Company had cash,
cash  equivalents  and  short-term  investments  of  $480.8  million and working
capital  of  $587.5  million.  Cash generated by operations of $83.7 million for
the  first  three  months of fiscal 2000 was $37.8 million higher than the $45.9
million generated from the first three months of fiscal 1999.  Increases in cash
generated  by  operations  resulted  primarily  from  the  cash  flow  impact of
increased  net  income,  increased receipt against advances for wafer purchases,
and  increases  in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and income tax payable.

Cash  flows  used for investing activities during the three months ended July 3,
1999  included  net  investment  purchases of $25.9 million and $9.9 million for
property,  plant  and  equipment.  During the first three months of fiscal 1999,
investing  activities  included  net  short-term  investment  purchases of $32.2
million  and  $7.8  million  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  acquisitions.

Net  cash  flows provided by financing activities were $9.3 million in the first
three  months  of fiscal 2000 and were attributable to $13.1 million in proceeds
from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans and $1.5 million in
proceeds  from  sales  of  put warrants, offset by acquisition of treasury stock
during the quarter of $5.3 million.  For the comparable fiscal 1999 period, cash
used  in  financing activities included $53.7 million in acquisition of treasury
stock  offset  by  $15.1  million  of  proceeds  from  employee  stock  plans.

Stockholders' equity increased by $57.7 million during the first three months of
fiscal  2000, principally as a result of the $51.6 million in net income for the
three months ended July 3, 1999.  In addition, the proceeds from the issuance of
common  stock  under employee stock plans of $13.1 million, related tax benefits
from  stock options of $10.1 million, and $1.5 million in proceeds from sales of
put  warrants  contributed  to  the increase, which were partially offset by the
transfer  of  $13.5  million  from  equity  to put warrants, and $5.3 million in
acquisition  of  treasury  stock.

The  Company  has  available  credit facilities for up to $46.2 million of which
$6.2 million is intended to meet occasional working capital requirements for the
Company's  wholly  owned  Irish subsidiary.  At July 3, 1999, no borrowings were
outstanding  under  the  lines  of  credit.

The  Company  anticipates  that existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from
operations  will  be  sufficient  to  satisfy  the  Company's cash needs for the
foreseeable  future.  The  Company  will  continue  to evaluate opportunities to
obtain  additional  wafer  capacity,  procure  additional  capital equipment and
facilities,  develop  new  products,  and  acquire  businesses,  products  or
technologies  that  would  complement  the  Company's  businesses  and  may  use
available  cash  or  other  sources  of  funding  for  such  purposes.

FACTORS  AFFECTING  FUTURE  OPERATING  RESULTS
- ----------------------------------------------

The  semiconductor  industry  is  characterized  by  rapid technological change,
intense  competition and cyclical market patterns.  Cyclical market patterns are
characterized  by  several  factors,  including:

    -     reduced  product  demand;
    -     limited visibility of demand for products beyond three to nine months;
    -     accelerated  erosion  of  average  selling  prices;  and
    -     volatile  capacity  availability.

Our results of operations are affected by several factors. These factors include
general  economic conditions, conditions specific to technology companies and to
the  semiconductor  industry  in particular, decreases in average selling prices
over the life of particular products and the timing of new product introductions
(by us, our competitors and others.)  In addition, our results of operations are
affected  by the ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of a given product
in a timely manner, the timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies,
the ability to safeguard patents and intellectual property from competitors, the
impact  of  new technologies which result in rapid escalation of demand for some
products  in  the  face  of equally steep declines in demand for others, and the
inability  to predict the success of our customers' products into their markets.
Market demand for our products, particularly for those most recently introduced,
can  be  difficult  to  predict,  especially  in  light of customers' demands to
shorten  product lead times and minimize inventory levels.  Unpredictable market
demand  could lead to revenue volatility if we were unable to provide sufficient
quantities of specified products in a given quarter. In addition, any difficulty
in  achieving  targeted  wafer  production  yields  could  adversely  affect our
financial condition and results of operations. We attempt to identify changes in
market  conditions as soon as possible; however, the dynamics of the market make
prediction  of  and  timely reaction to such events difficult.  Due to these and
other  factors,  our past results, including those described in this report, are
much  less  reliable predictors of the future than with companies in many older,
more  stable and less dynamic industries.  Based on the factors noted herein, we
may  experience  substantial  period-to-period  fluctuations in future operating
results.

Our  future  success depends in a large part on the continued service of our key
technical,  sales,  marketing  and  management  personnel  and on our ability to
continue  to attract and retain qualified employees.  Particularly important are
those  highly  skilled  design, process, software and test engineers involved in
the  manufacture  of  existing  products and the development of new products and
processes.  The  competition  for such personnel is intense, and the loss of key
employees  could  have  a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results  of  operations.

Sales  and  operations  outside  of  the  United  States subject us to the risks
associated  with  conducting  business  in  foreign  economic  and  regulatory
environments.  Our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could be
adversely  affected  by unfavorable economic conditions in countries in which we
do  significant  business  and  by  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates
affecting  those  countries.  For  example,  we  have  sales  and  operations in
Southeast  Asia  and  Japan.  Past  economic weakness in these markets adversely
affected  revenues,  and such conditions may occur in the future.  Customers may
face  reduced  access  to  capital  and exchange rate fluctuations may adversely
affect their ability to purchase our products.  In addition, our ability to sell
at  competitive  prices  may  be  diminished.  Currency instability may increase
credit  risks  as the weak currencies may impair our customers' ability to repay
existing  obligations.  Any  or  all of these factors could adversely affect our
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  in  the  near  future.

Our  financial  condition  and  results  of operations are becoming increasingly
dependent  on  a  global  economy.  Any  instability  in  worldwide  economic
environments  could lead to a contraction of capital spending.  Additional risks
to  us include government regulation of exports, imposition of tariffs and other
potential trade barriers, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in
some countries and generally longer receivable collection periods.  Our business
is  also  subject to the risks associated with the imposition of legislation and
regulations  relating  specifically  to  the  import  or export of semiconductor
products.  We  cannot  predict whether quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or
restrictions  will  be  imposed by the United States or other countries upon the
import  or  export  of  our  products in the future or what effect, if any, such
actions  would  have  on  our  financial  condition  and  results of operations.

Many  of  our  operations  are  centered  in an area of California that has been
seismically  active.  Should  there  be  a  major  earthquake  in this area, our
operations  may  be  disrupted.  This  type  of  disruption  could result in our
inability  to  ship  products  in  a timely manner, thereby materially adversely
affecting  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.

The  securities of many high technology companies have historically been subject
to  extreme price and volume fluctuations, which may adversely affect the market
price  of  our  common  stock.

DEPENDENCE  UPON  INDEPENDENT  MANUFACTURERS  AND  SUBCONTRACTORS

We do not manufacture the wafers used for our products.  During the past several
years,  most  of  our  wafers  have  been  manufactured  by  UMC and Seiko Epson
Corporation  (Seiko  Epson),  with  recent wafers also manufactured by USIC.  We
have depended upon these suppliers and others to produce wafers with competitive
performance  and  cost  attributes  which  include  transitioning  to  advanced
manufacturing  process  technologies,  producing wafers at acceptable yields and
delivering  them in a timely manner.  While the timeliness, yield and quality of
wafer  deliveries  have  met our requirements to date, we cannot assure that our
wafer  suppliers  will  not  experience future manufacturing problems, including
delays  in  the  realization  of  advanced  manufacturing  process technologies.
Additionally,  disruption  of  operations  at  these  foundries  for any reason,
including  natural  disasters  such as fires, floods, or earthquakes, as well as
disruptions  to access to adequate supplies of electricity, natural gas or water
could  cause  delays  in  shipments  of  our products, and could have a material
adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations.  We  are  also  dependent  on
subcontractors  to  provide  semiconductor  assembly  services.  Any  prolonged
inability to obtain wafers or assembly services with competitive performance and
cost  attributes,  adequate yields or timely delivery, or any other circumstance
that  would  require  us  to  seek  alternative  sources  of supply, could delay
shipments  and  have  a  material  adverse effect on our financial condition and
results  of  operations.

Our  growth  will  depend  in  a large part upon our ability to obtain increased
wafer  fabrication  capacity  and assembly services from suppliers that are cost
competitive.  We  consider  various  alternatives  in order to secure additional
wafer  capacity.  These  alternatives  include,  without  limitation,  equity
investments  in,  or  loans,  deposits,  or  other  financial  commitments  to
independent  wafer  manufacturers.  We  also consider the use of contracts which
commit  us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods.  We
are  currently able to obtain wafers from existing suppliers in a timely manner.
However, at times we have been unable, and may in the future be unable, to fully
satisfy customer demand because of production constraints, including the ability
of  suppliers  and  subcontractors  to provide materials and services to satisfy
customer  delivery  dates,  as  well  as  our  ability  to  process products for
shipment.  In addition, a significant increase in general industry demand or any
interruption of supply could reduce our supply of wafers or increase our cost of
such wafers.  These events could have a material adverse affect on our financial
condition  and  results  of  operations.

DEPENDENCE  ON  NEW  PRODUCTS

Our  future  success  depends  in  a  large  part  on our ability to develop and
introduce on a timely basis new products which address customer requirements and
compete  effectively  on  the  basis  of  price,  density,  functionality  and
performance.  The success of new product introductions is dependent upon several
factors,  including:

    -     timely  completion  of  new  product  designs;
    -     our  ability  to  utilize advanced manufacturing process technologies;
    -     achieving  acceptable  yields;
    -     the  availability  of  supporting  software  design  tools;
    -     utilization  of  predefined  cores  of  logic;  and
    -     market  acceptance.

We cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successful or that
our  new  products  will  achieve  market  acceptance.  Revenues relating to our
mature products are expected to continue to decline in the future.  As a result,
we  will be increasingly dependent on revenues derived from newer products along
with  cost reductions on current products.  We rely primarily on obtaining yield
improvements  and  corresponding  cost reductions in the manufacture of existing
products and on introducing new products which incorporate advanced features and
other  price/performance  factors  that  enable  us  to  increase revenues while
maintaining consistent margins.  To the extent that such cost reductions and new
product introductions do not occur in a timely manner, or to the extent that our
products  do  not  achieve  market acceptance at prices with higher margins, our
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations could be materially adversely
affected.

COMPETITION

Our  FPGAs  and  CPLDs  compete  in  the  programmable logic marketplace, with a
substantial  majority  of  our  revenues derived from our FPGA product families.
The  industries  in  which  we  compete  are  intensely  competitive  and  are
characterized by rapid technological change, product obsolescence and continuous
price  erosion.  We expect increased competition, both from existing competitors
and  from  a number of new companies that may enter our market.  We believe that
important  competitive  factors  in  the  programmable  logic  market  include:

    -     product  pricing;
    -     product  performance,  reliability  and  density;
    -     the  adaptability  of  products  to  specific  applications;
    -     ease  of  use  and  functionality  of  software  design  tools;
    -     functionality  of  predefined  cores  of  logic;  and
    -     the  ability  to  provide  timely  customer  service  and  support.

Our  strategy  for expansion in the programmable logic market includes continued
introduction  of  new  product architectures which address high volume, low cost
applications as well as high performance, leading-edge density applications.  In
addition,  we would anticipate continued price reductions proportionate with our
ability  to lower the cost of manufacture for established products.  However, we
cannot  assure  that  we  will be successful in achieving these strategies.  Our
major  sources  of  competition  are  comprised  of  several  elements:

    -     the  manufacturers  of  custom  CMOS  gate  arrays;
    -     providers of high density programmable logic products characterized by
          FPGA-type  architectures;
    -     providers  of  high  speed,  low  density  CPLD  devices;  and
    -     other  providers  of  new  or  emerging  programmable  logic products.

We  compete  with  custom  gate array manufacturers on the basis of lower design
costs,  shorter  development  schedules,  reduced  inventory  risks  and  field
upgradability.  The  primary  attributes of custom gate arrays are high density,
high  speed  and  low  production costs in high volumes.  We continue to develop
lower  cost architectures intended to narrow the gap between current custom gate
array  production  costs (in high volumes) and PLD production costs.  We compete
with  high density programmable logic suppliers on the basis of performance, the
ability to deliver complete solutions to customers, voltage and customer support
by  taking advantage of the primary characteristics of our PLD product offerings
which  include: flexibility, high speed implementation, quick time-to-market and
system  level  capabilities.  Competition among CPLD suppliers and manufacturers
of  new  or  emerging  programmable  logic products is based primarily on price,
performance,  design,  customer  support,  software  utility  and the ability to
deliver  complete  solutions  to  customers.  Some  of  our current or potential
competitors  have  substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and
technical  resources than we do.  To the extent that such efforts to compete are
not  successful,  our  financial  condition  and  results of operations could be
materially  adversely  affected.

The  benefits of programmable logic have attracted a number of companies to this
market.  Competition  is  based  primarily  on  density, speed, design, price or
software  utility.  We  recognize  that different applications require different
programmable  technologies,  and  we are developing architectures, processes and
products  to  meet  these  varying  customer  needs.  Recognizing the increasing
importance  of  standard  software  solutions, we have developed common software
design  tools  that  support  the full range of integrated circuit products.  We
believe  that  automation and ease of design are significant competitive factors
in  the  programmable  logic  market.

Several  companies,  both large and small, have introduced products that compete
with  ours  or have announced their intention to enter this market.  Some of our
competitors may possess innovative technology, which could prove superior to our
technology  in  certain  applications.  In  addition,  we  anticipate  potential
competition from suppliers of logic products based on new technologies.  Some of
our  current  or  potential  competitors  have  substantially greater financial,
manufacturing,  marketing  and  technical  resources than we do. This additional
competition  could  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and results of
operations.

We  could  also  face  competition from our licensees.  Under a license from us,
Lucent  Technologies  is  manufacturing and marketing our non-proprietary XC3000
FPGA  products  and  is  employing  that  technology  to provide additional FPGA
products  offering  higher  density.  Seiko  Epson has rights to manufacture our
products  and  market  them  in Japan and Europe, but is not currently doing so.
Advanced  Micro Devices is licensed to use certain of our patents to manufacture
and  market  products.

INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY

We  rely  upon  patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law to protect our
intellectual  property.  We cannot assure that such intellectual property rights
can  be  successfully  asserted  in  the  future  or  will  not  be invalidated,
circumvented  or  challenged.  From  time  to time, third parties, including our
competitors,  have  asserted  patent,  copyright and other intellectual property
rights  to  technologies  that are important to us.  We cannot assure that third
parties  will  not  assert  infringement  claims  against us in the future, that
assertions  by  third  parties  will  not result in costly litigation or that we
would  prevail  in such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed
patents  from  third  parties  on  commercially  reasonable  terms.  Litigation,
regardless  of  its  outcome, could result in substantial costs and diversion of
our  resources.  Any  infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us
could  materially  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition  and  results of
operations.  See  Part  II - Other Information, Item 1 - Legal Proceedings for a
discussion  of  litigation  between  Xilinx  and  Altera  Corporation.

COMPUTER  INFORMATION  SYSTEMS

In  order  to  compete  effectively  in  an  industry  characterized  by  rapid
technological  change,  intense  competition  and  cyclical  market patterns, we
continually  evaluate  our  computer  information systems.  As a result, we have
recently  implemented  new  computer  information systems or system enhancements
relating to our semiconductor manufacturing, software manufacturing, order entry
processing  and  financial  applications.

Like  most  other  companies  using  computer  information  systems  in  their
operations, we are currently working to resolve the potential impact of the Year
2000  on  the  processing  of  date-sensitive  information  by  our computerized
information  systems,  as  well  as  the  vendor  and  customer  date-sensitive
computerized  information electronically transferred to us.  The Year 2000 issue
is  the  result of computer programs being written using two digits, rather than
four,  to  define  the  applicable  Year.  Any  of  our  systems  that  have
time-sensitive  software may recognize a year ending in "00" as 1900 rather than
the  year  2000, which could result in miscalculations, classification errors or
system  failures.

We  have  performed  a thorough review of our internal use software and hardware
applications  and  software products in order to identify those applications and
products that are not Year 2000 compliant. Currently, our Year 2000 efforts have
been  focused  on  final  Year 2000 integrated verification for the software and
hardware  applications  identified  in  the  review  in  addition to those newly
implemented or enhanced.   We are also placing additional emphasis on finalizing
the  assessment  of  our outside suppliers and other critical business partners.
We  believe  that  our  internal  computer  system implementation or enhancement
efforts principally conducted to improve competitive and operating efficiencies,
as  described  above,  have  also  addressed  some  of  our  internal  Year 2000
compliance  issues.  Additional  internal information systems are also currently
being  upgraded  and  are  expected  to be completed by the end of this calendar
year,  although  we cannot assure these upgrades will be completed as scheduled.
Electronic  data interchange modifications have been completed that are intended
to  ensure  all  dates  are handled properly, although we cannot assure that all
dates  will  be  handled  properly.  With  regard  to all information technology
hardware, including desktops, servers, networking and telecom equipment, we have
completed  our  assessments  and  nearly  all  of  the  necessary upgrades.  The
remaining  upgrades are expected to be completed by the second quarter of fiscal
2000,  although  we cannot assure these upgrades will be completed as scheduled.

We believe that our software releases beginning with version M1.5i and including
version  M2.1i which  we started shipping in July 1999, are Year 2000 compliant,
although  we cannot assure that they are Year 2000 compliant.   However, some of
our customers are running product versions that are not Year 2000 compliant.  We
have  been encouraging such customers to migrate to the current product version.

We  plan  to  take  several  steps  to minimize any Year 2000 effects, including
miscalculations,  classification  errors  or  system  failures.  Our  internal
preparedness  includes  specific steps that will be taken in anticipation of the
Year  2000.  In  addition,  we  are relying on a contingency plan which has been
developed  and  is  now  being  implemented  which  includes manual workarounds,
attention  to  inventory  levels,  the  ability to utilize both our San Jose and
Ireland  manufacturing  facilities  for shipment and having multiple vendors who
can  provide  critical  services,  wafer  assembly  as  well  as  test products.

The  costs  directed  solely towards Year 2000 compliance are not incremental to
us, but rather represent a reallocation of existing resources.  To date, we have
incurred  less  than  $1.5  million on efforts directed solely towards Year 2000
compliance  and  expect  to  incur  a  total  of less than $2.0 million when the
process is completed, although we cannot assure that this will be the case.  The
costs  of  addressing  potential  problems  are not currently expected to have a
material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flows  in  future periods.  If, however, we, our customers or vendors are unable
to  resolve  such  processing  issues  on  a  timely,  cost-effective basis, our
financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  could be adversely affected.

The  statements  above represent forward-looking statements subject to risks and
uncertainties  and  actual  results  may  differ materially from those described
above  due  to  a  number  of  risk factors.  These factors include, but are not
limited  to:

    -     the  complexity  of  identifying  potential  Year  2000  issues;
    -     our ability to allocate and/or obtain qualified resources to resolve
          Year 2000 issues;
    -     our ability to work effectively with vendors and other critical
          business partners; and
    -     our effectiveness at encouraging customers to migrate towards our
          current software  product  version.

We  cannot  assure  that  we will be able to successfully modify all systems and
products  to  comply  with  Year  2000 requirements, which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  If we were
to  discontinue our Year 2000 preparedness at this time, we would not be able to
ensure  all  internal  networks  and desktops were operational, nor ensure third
party  vendors  were  able  to  meet  our  inventory demands or send information
electronically.  In  addition,  disruptions  to  the economy generally resulting
from  the  Year 2000 issues could also materially adversely impact us.  We could
be  subject  to  litigation  for  computer  system  failures  such  as equipment
shutdowns or failure to properly date business records.  At this time, we cannot
reasonably  estimate  the  amount  of  potential  liability  and  lost  revenue.

EURO  CURRENCY

Beginning  in  1999, 11 member countries of the European Union established fixed
conversion  rates  between  their  existing sovereign currencies and adopted the
Euro as their common legal currency.  During the three-year transition, the Euro
will  be  available  for non-cash transactions and legacy currencies will remain
legal  tender.  We  are  continuing to assess the Euro's impact on our business.
We are reviewing the ability of our accounting and information systems to handle
the  conversion,  the ability of foreign banks to report on dual currencies, the
legal  and  contractual  implications  of  agreements,  as well as reviewing our
pricing  strategies.  We  expect  that  any  additional  modifications  to  our
operations  and  systems  will be completed on a timely basis and do not believe
the  conversion will have a material adverse impact on our operations.  However,
we  cannot  assure  that  we will be able to successfully modify all systems and
contracts  to  comply  with  Euro  requirements.

LITIGATION

We  are  currently engaged in several legal matters.  See "Legal Proceedings" in
Part  II.

PART  II.  OTHER  INFORMATION

Item  1.     Legal  Proceedings

On  June  7, 1993, the Company filed suit against Altera Corporation (Altera) in
the  United  States  District  Court for the Northern District of California for
infringement  of  certain  of the Company's patents.  Subsequently, Altera filed
suit  against  the  Company,  alleging  that  certain  of the Company's products
infringe  certain Altera patents.  Fact and expert discovery have been completed
in both cases, which have been consolidated.  On April 20, 1995, Altera filed an
additional  suit  against the Company in the Federal District Court in Delaware,
alleging  that  the  Company's  XC5200  family  infringes an Altera patent.  The
Company  answered the Delaware suit denying that the XC5200 family infringes the
patent  in suit, asserting certain affirmative defenses and counterclaiming that
the  Altera  Max  9000  family  infringes certain of the Company's patents.  The
Delaware  suit  was  transferred  to  the  United  States District Court for the
Northern  District of California and is also before the same judge.  Both Altera
and  the  Company  have  filed motions with the Court for summary judgement with
respect  to  certain of the issues pending in the litigation.  Those motions are
still  pending.

On  July  22, 1998, Altera and Joseph Ward, a former Xilinx employee, filed suit
against the Company in Superior Court in Santa Clara County, California, arising
out  of  the  Company's  efforts  to  prevent  disclosure  of  certain  Company
confidential  information.  Altera's suit requests declaratory relief and claims
the  Company  engages  in  unfair  business  practices  and  interference  with
contractual  relations.  On  September  10,  1998 the Company filed cross claims
against  Altera  and  Ward  for unfair competition and breach of contract, among
other  claims,  in  the California action.  On October 20, 1998, Altera and Ward
filed  crossclaims against the Company for malicious prosecution of civil action
and  defamation.

The  ultimate  outcome  of  these  matters  cannot  be  determined at this time.
Management  believes  that  it  has  meritorious  defenses to such claims and is
defending them vigorously.  The foregoing is a forward-looking statement subject
to risks and uncertainties, and the future outcome of these matters could differ
materially  due to the uncertain nature of each legal proceeding and because the
lawsuits  are  still  in  the  pre-discovery  or  pre-trial  stages.

There  are  no other pending legal proceedings of a material nature to which the
Company  is a party or of which any of its property is the subject.  The Company
knows  of  no  legal  proceedings  contemplated by any governmental authority or
agency.
