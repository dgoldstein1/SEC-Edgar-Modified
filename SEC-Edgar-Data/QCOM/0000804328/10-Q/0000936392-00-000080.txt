                              QUALCOMM INCORPORATED
              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (UNAUDITED)
NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

   The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company" or "QUALCOMM"), without
audit, in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not
necessarily include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair
presentation of its financial position, results of operations and cash flows in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The condensed
consolidated balance sheet at September 26, 1999 was derived from the audited
consolidated balance sheet at that date which is not presented herein. The
Company operates and reports using a period ending on the last Sunday of each
month.

   In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the
interim periods presented reflects all adjustments (which include only normal,
recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation. These condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 26, 1999. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year.

   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain prior year amounts
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

   The Company effected a two-for-one stock split in May 1999 and a four-for-one
stock split in December 1999. Stockholders' equity has been restated to give
retroactive recognition to the stock splits for all periods presented by
reclassifying the par value of the additional shares arising from the splits
from paid-in capital to common stock. All references in the financial statements
and notes to number of shares and per share amounts have been restated to
reflect these stock splits.

   Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting
period. Diluted earnings per common share ("diluted EPS") reflect the potential
dilutive effect, calculated using the treasury stock method, of 68,626,000 and
27,969,000 additional common shares that are issuable upon exercise of
outstanding stock options for the three months ended December 26, 1999 and
December 27, 1998, respectively, and the potential dilutive effect of Trust
Convertible Preferred Securities convertible into 57,615,000 shares of common
stock, determined on an if-converted basis, for the three months ended December
26, 1999.

   Options outstanding during the three months ended December 26, 1999 and
December 27, 1998 to purchase approximately 1,821,000 shares and 53,111,000
shares of common stock, respectively, were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because the options' exercise price was greater than the average
market price of the common stock during the period and, therefore, the effect
would be anti-dilutive. Net income in the computation of diluted EPS for the
three months ended December 26, 1999 is increased by $7 million representing the
assumed savings of distributions, net of taxes, on the Trust Convertible
Preferred Securities. The inclusion of additional common shares assuming the
conversion of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities for the three months
ended December 27, 1998 would have been anti-dilutive.

   During the first quarter of fiscal 2000, 7,793,182 Trust Convertible
Preferred Securities were converted into 42,906,040 shares of common stock. The
conversions resulted in a $390 million reduction in the recorded obligation to
Trust Convertible Preferred Securities holders (Note 11).

   The Company displays the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income or
loss separately in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. Total
comprehensive income, which is comprised of net income and other comprehensive
income (loss), amounted to approximately $208 million and $48 million for the
three months ended December 26, 1999 and December 27, 1998, respectively.
Components of other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following (in
thousands):

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 ("FAS 133"), "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." In May 1999, the FASB voted to
delay the effective date of FAS 133 by one year. The Company will be required to
adopt FAS 133 for fiscal year 2001. This statement establishes a new model for
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. Under FAS 133, all
derivatives must be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair
value. The Company has not completed its determination of the impact of the
adoption of this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

   Unbilled receivables represent costs and profits recorded in excess of
amounts billable pursuant to contract provisions and are expected to be realized
within one year.

   Finance receivables result from arrangements in which the Company has agreed
to provide its customers or certain CDMA customers of Ericsson (Note 7) with
long-term interest bearing debt financing for the purchase of equipment and/or
services. Such financing is generally collateralized by the related equipment.
Finance receivables are comprised as follows (in thousands):

At December 26, 1999, commitments to extend long-term financing to CDMA
customers of Ericsson (Note 7) totaled approximately $355 million, which the
Company expects to fund over the next five years. Such commitments are subject
to the customers meeting certain conditions established in the financing

NOTE 4 - INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES

Globalstar L.P.

   Through partnership interests held in certain intermediate limited
partnerships, the Company owns a 6.4% partnership interest in Globalstar L.P.
("Globalstar"), a limited partnership formed to develop, own and operate the
Globalstar low-Earth-orbit ("LEO") satellite system utilizing CDMA technology
("the Globalstar System").

   At December 26 and September 26, 1999, $405 million and $349 million in
interest bearing financed amounts and $189 million and $171 million in accounts
receivable, including $54 million and $59 million in unbilled receivables, were
outstanding from Globalstar, respectively. The Company is finalizing
negotiations with Globalstar which will result in the financing of current and
future contract payments. Such financing is expected to be interest bearing and
paid by Globalstar in quarterly installments beginning January 15, 2001 through
August 15, 2003. As a result of these negotiations, the Company changed its
estimate of amounts collectible under the Globalstar development contract and
recorded previously unrecognized revenue of $9 million and interest income of $9
million during the first quarter of fiscal 2000. Interest bearing financed
amounts include $296 million at December 26, 1999 and $240 million at September
26, 1999 in trade receivables which were reclassified to non-current finance
receivables in anticipation of such financing. At December 26, 1999, $104
million in future contract payments are expected to be eligible for financing
under the anticipated financing agreement with Globalstar.

Korea Telecom Freetel

   On November 24, 1999, the Company invested approximately $196 million in
Korea Telecom Freetel ("KT Freetel") and received 2,565,000 common shares,
representing a 1.9% interest in KT Freetel, and a zero coupon bond with warrants
to purchase approximately 1,851,000 additional shares. The exercise price of
the warrants is expected to be paid by tendering the bond as payment in full.
KT Freetel has agreed to commercially deploy high data rate ("HDR") technology,
subject to the successful completion of technical and marketing trials. If KT
Freetel meets certain obligations related to HDR technology, QUALCOMM is
required to



                                       9
<PAGE>   10

exercise the warrants. If KT Freetel does not meet such obligations, QUALCOMM
will have the right to redeem the bond at a premium equal to 10% per annum.

Other Investments

   The Company has entered into strategic alliances with domestic and
international emerging wireless telecommunications operating companies. These
alliances often involve investment by QUALCOMM of capital in these operating
companies. Funding commitments related to these investments total $103 million
at December 26, 1999, which the Company expects to fund over three years. Such
commitments are subject to the operating companies meeting certain conditions;
actual equity funding may be in lesser amounts.

NOTE 5 - BANK LINES OF CREDIT

   The Company has an unsecured credit facility under which banks are committed
to make up to $400 million in revolving loans to the Company. The credit
facility expires in March 2001. The facility may be extended on an annual basis
upon maturity. The Company is currently obligated to pay commitment fees equal
to 0.175% per annum on the unused amount of the credit facility. The credit
facility includes certain restrictive financial and operating covenants. At
December 26, 1999, there were no amounts or letters of credit issued or
outstanding under the credit facility.

   Under terms of two identical revolving credit agreements, negotiated in 1996
and expiring in July 2000, QUALCOMM Personal Electronics ("QPE"), a 51% owned
consolidated subsidiary of the Company, may borrow a total of $150 million.
Borrowings under the facilities, which are drawn in equal amounts, totaled $124
million and $112 million at December 26 and September 26, 1999, respectively.
The interest rate under the facilities is at the applicable LIBOR rate plus
0.5%. The credit facilities include covenants, which, among other things,
require QPE to maintain a minimum tangible net worth.

NOTE 6 - RESTRUCTURING

   During January 1999, the Company completed a review of its operating
structure to identify opportunities to improve operating effectiveness. As a
result of this review, management approved a formal restructuring plan, and the
Company recorded charges to operations of $15 million during the second quarter
of fiscal 1999, including $10 million in employee termination costs, $3 million
in asset impairments and $1 million in estimated net losses on subleases or
lease cancellation penalties. The following table (in thousands) presents the
roll forward from the initial provision during the second quarter of fiscal 1999
to September 26, 1999, and from September 26, 1999 to December 26, 1999:

NOTE 7 - DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES

   On December 22, 1999, QUALCOMM announced an agreement with Kyocera
Corporation ("Kyocera") which will result in Kyocera acquiring QUALCOMM's
terrestrial-based wireless CDMA consumer phone business, including its phone
inventory, manufacturing equipment and customer commitments. Under the Kyocera
agreement, Kyocera has agreed to purchase at least a majority of its CDMA
chipset requirements from QUALCOMM for a period of five years. Kyocera will
continue its existing royalty-bearing CDMA license agreement with QUALCOMM. The
transaction, which is subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing
conditions, is expected to close by the end of February 2000.

   As part of the Kyocera agreement, QUALCOMM will form a new subsidiary with a
substantial number of employees from QUALCOMM Consumer Products to provide
services to Kyocera on a cost-plus basis to support Kyocera's phone business for
up to three years. Selected employees of QPE will be transferred to Kyocera.
Upon the close of the transaction, it is anticipated that QPE manufacturing
assets will be



                                       10
<PAGE>   11

liquidated. QUALCOMM recorded $27 million in charges in the first quarter of
fiscal 2000 to reflect the estimated difference between the carrying value of
the net assets and the consideration to be received from Kyocera, less costs to
sell. The Company estimates that additional charges in the second quarter of
fiscal 2000 relating to the disposition of the terrestrial-based wireless CDMA
phone business could total approximately $50 million. The additional charges
will primarily relate to Kyocera's right under the agreement to exclude certain
properties and equipment and employee termination costs.

   In May 1999, the Company sold certain of its assets related to its
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business to Telefonaktiebolaget LM
Ericsson ("Ericsson") and entered into various license and settlement agreements
with Ericsson. The Company has received notice of Ericsson's intention to
dispute the purchase price (Note 9). Pursuant to the Company's agreement with
Ericsson, the Company will extend financing for possible future sales by
Ericsson of infrastructure equipment and related services to specific customers
in certain geographic areas, including Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Russia or in
other areas selected by Ericsson (Note 2).

NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES

   The Company's income tax provisions for the first quarters of fiscal 2000 and
1999 reflect adjustments for the retroactive reinstatements of the R&D tax
credit. Excluding the adjustments, the Company currently estimates its annual
effective income tax rate to be approximately 38% for fiscal 2000, compared to
35% for fiscal 1999. NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Litigation

   On March 5, 1997, the Company filed a complaint against Motorola, Inc.
("Motorola"). The complaint was filed in response to allegations by Motorola
that the Company's then, recently announced, Q Phone infringes design and
utility patents held by Motorola as well as trade dress and common law rights
relating to the appearance of certain Motorola wireless telephone products. The
complaint denies such allegations and seeks a judicial declaration that the
Company's products do not infringe any patents held by Motorola. On March 10,
1997, Motorola filed a complaint against the Company (the "Motorola Complaint"),
alleging claims based primarily on the above-alleged infringement. The Company's
motion to transfer the Motorola Complaint to the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of California was granted on April 3, 1997. On April 24, 1997,
the court denied Motorola's motion for a preliminary injunction thereby
permitting the Company to continue to manufacture, market and sell the Q Phone.
On April 25, 1997, Motorola appealed the denial of its motion for a preliminary
injunction. On January 16, 1998 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit denied Motorola's appeal and affirmed the decision of the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of California refusing Motorola's request to
enjoin QUALCOMM from manufacturing and selling the Q Phone. On June 4, 1997,
Motorola filed another lawsuit alleging infringement by QUALCOMM of four
patents. Three of the patents had already been alleged in previous litigation
between the parties. On August 18, 1997, Motorola filed another complaint
against the Company alleging infringement by the Company of seven additional
patents. All of the Motorola cases have been consolidated for pretrial
proceedings. On August 6, 1999, the court granted the Company's motion for
summary judgment that the Q Phone does not infringe two of Motorola's design
patents. On October 5, 1999, the U.S. District Court in San Diego granted the
Company's motions for summary judgment that the Q Phone does not infringe the
last two Motorola design patents remaining in the case. As a consequence of
these rulings and Motorola's decision to drop one utility patent from the case,
there are no design patents and a total of ten utility patents remaining in the
case. The cases have been set for a final pretrial conference in April 2000.
Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the dispute
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations,
liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are without
merit and will continue to vigorously defend the action.

   On July 20, 1999, the Company filed a lawsuit against Motorola seeking a
judicial determination that the Company has the right to terminate all licenses
granted to Motorola under a 1990 Patent License Agreement, while retaining all
licenses granted by Motorola to the Company under the same agreement. The
Company's complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of California where the earlier actions between the Company and
Motorola described above have been pending for more than two years. The
complaint alleges that Motorola has committed breaches of the Patent License
Agreement that include pursuing a lawsuit against the Company for infringement
of patents that are in fact licensed to the Company under the agreement and a
failure to grant certain sublicenses to the Company in accordance with the terms
of the agreement. The Company's new



                                       11
<PAGE>   12

filing also seeks a ruling that upon termination of the Patent License
Agreement, the patents formerly licensed to Motorola would be infringed by CDMA
handsets, integrated circuits and network infrastructure equipment made and sold
by Motorola. On August 5, 1999, the Company amended its complaint to allege that
Motorola's CDMA wireless phones infringe three patents of the Company. The
Company's new claims seek damages and an injunction against Motorola's sale of
infringing phones. Motorola has filed counterclaims alleging breach of the
Patent License Agreement and a DS-CDMA Technology License Agreement also signed
in 1990. On January 14, 2000, the court entered an order staying the 1999 case
pending resolution of the consolidated 1997 cases.

   On or about June 5, 1997, Elisra Electronic Systems Ltd. ("Elisra") submitted
to the International Chamber of Commerce a Request for Arbitration of a dispute
with the Company based upon a Development and Supply Agreement ("DSA") entered
into between the parties effective November 15, 1995, alleging that the Company
wrongfully terminated the DSA, seeking monetary damages. The Company thereafter
submitted a Reply and Counterclaim, alleging that Elisra breached the DSA,
seeking monetary damages. Subsequently, the parties stipulated that the dispute
be heard before an arbitrator under the jurisdiction of the American Arbitration
Association, and to bifurcate the resolution of liability issues from damage
issues. To date, the arbitrator has heard testimony regarding the liability or
non-liability of the parties, and a briefing schedule has been set. Although
there can be no assurance that the resolution of these claims will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or
financial position, the Company believes that the claims made by Elisra are
without merit and will vigorously defend against the claims.

   On October 27, 1998, the Electronics and Telecommunications Research
Institute of Korea ("ETRI") submitted to the International Chamber of Commerce a
Request for Arbitration (the "Request") of a dispute with the Company arising
out of a Joint Development Agreement ("JDA") dated April 30, 1992, between ETRI
and the Company. In the Request, ETRI alleges that the Company has breached
certain provisions of the JDA and seeks monetary damages and an accounting. The
Company filed an answer and counterclaims denying the allegations, seeking a
declaration establishing the termination of the JDA and monetary damages and
injunctive relief against ETRI. In accordance with the JDA, the arbitration will
take place in San Diego. The arbitration hearing is scheduled to commence July
5, 2000. Although there can be no assurance that the resolution of these claims
will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations,
liquidity or financial position, the Company believes that the claims are
without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

   On May 6, 1999, Thomas Sprague, a former employee of the Company, filed a
putative class action against the Company, ostensibly on behalf of himself and
those of the Company's former employees who were offered employment with
Ericsson in conjunction with the sale to Ericsson of certain of the Company's
infrastructure division assets and liabilities and who elected not to
participate in a Retention Bonus Plan being offered to such former employees.
The complaint was filed in California Superior Court in and for the County of
San Diego and purports to state eight causes of action arising primarily out of
alleged breaches of the terms of the Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan, as
amended from time to time. The putative class sought to include former employees
of the Company who, among other things, "have not or will not execute the Bonus
Retention Plan and accompanying full and complete release of QUALCOMM." The
complaint seeks an order accelerating all unvested stock options for the members
of the class. Of the 1,053 transitioning former employees who had unvested stock
options, 1,016 elected to participate in the Retention Bonus Plan offered by
QUALCOMM and Ericsson, which provides several benefits including cash
compensation based upon a portion of the value of their unvested options, and
includes a written release of claims against the Company. On July 30, 1999,
plaintiffs filed a First Amended Complaint incorporating the allegations set
forth in the original complaint, adding two new causes of action and expanding
the putative class to also include those former employees who chose to
participate in the Bonus Retention Plan. In October 1999, the court sustained
the Company's demurrer to the plaintiffs' cause of action for breach of
fiduciary duty. Counsel for the putative class filed a Second Amended Complaint,
including substantially the same allegations as the First Amended Complaint, on
November 1, 1999. Although there can be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome
of the dispute would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results
of operations, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims
are without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

   On June 29, 1999, GTE Wireless, Incorporated ("GTE") filed an action in the
U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia asserting that wireless
telephones sold by the Company infringe a single patent allegedly owned by GTE.
On September 15, 1999, the court granted the company's motion to transfer the
action to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.
Although there can be no assurance that an



                                       12
<PAGE>   13

unfavorable outcome of the dispute would not have a material adverse effect on
the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position, the
Company believes the action is without merit and will vigorously defend the
action.

   QUALCOMM has received notice from Ericsson that Ericsson intends to dispute
the determination of the purchase price under the Agreement, pursuant to which
Ericsson acquired certain assets related to the Company's terrestrial wireless
infrastructure business in May 1999. QUALCOMM has also received notice from
Ericsson that Ericsson intends to assert claims for indemnification under the
Agreement. QUALCOMM and Ericsson are having on-going discussions aimed at
potentially resolving these claims. In the event the parties are unable to
resolve these claims, they are subject to dispute resolution procedures set
forth in the Agreement. Although there can be no assurance that the resolution
of these claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results
of operations, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims
are without merit and will vigorously defend them.

   The Company is engaged in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of its business and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, liquidity or
financial position.

Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees

   The Company has issued a letter of credit to support a guarantee of up to
$22.5 million of Globalstar (Note 4) borrowings under an existing bank financing
agreement. The guarantee will expire in December 2000. The letter of credit is
collateralized by a commensurate amount of the Company's investments in debt
securities. As of December 26, 1999, Globalstar had no borrowings outstanding
under the existing bank financing agreement.

   In addition to the letter of credit on behalf of Globalstar, the Company has
$21 million of letters of credit and $103 million of other financial guarantees
outstanding as of December 26, 1999, none of which are collateralized.

Leap Wireless Commitments

   QUALCOMM has a funding commitment to Leap Wireless in the form of a $265
million secured credit facility, which consists of two sub-facilities. The first
sub-facility enables Leap Wireless to borrow up to $35 million from QUALCOMM,
solely to meet the normal working capital and operating expenses of Leap
Wireless, including salaries, overhead and credit facility fees, but excluding,
among other things, strategic capital investments in wireless operators,
substantial acquisitions of capital products, and/or the acquisition of
telecommunications licenses. The other sub-facility enables Leap Wireless to
borrow up to $230 million from QUALCOMM, solely to use as investment capital to
make certain identified portfolio investments. Amounts borrowed under the credit
facility will be due and payable on September 23, 2006. QUALCOMM has a first
priority security interest in, subject to minor exceptions, substantially all of
the assets of Leap Wireless for so long as any amounts are outstanding under the
credit facility. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at a
variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly
beginning September 30, 2001; prior to such time, accrued interest shall be
added to the principal amount outstanding. At December 26, 1999, the remaining
commitment under this facility is $90 million.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
        FINANCIAL CONDITION

   This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 of
Part I of this Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results
of Operations and Financial Condition for the year ended September 26, 1999
contained in the Company's 1999 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   Except for the historical information contained herein, the following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. QUALCOMM's future results could differ materially from those
discussed here. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not specifically limited to: the ability to develop and
introduce cost effective new products in a timely manner; the risk that the rate
of growth in the CDMA subscriber population will decrease; risks associated with
the scale-up, acceptance and operations of CDMA systems, including HDR
technology; risks associated with component shortages and inventory balancing by
customers; risks associated with strategic opportunities or acquisitions,
divestitures and investments the Company may pursue; risks related to the
ability to sustain or improve operational efficiency and profitability; risks
relating to the success of Globalstar; developments in current or future
litigation; the Company's ability to effectively manage growth and the intense
competition in the wireless communications industry; and risks associated with
the timing and receipt of license fees and royalties; risk associated with
international business activities; and risks related to customer receivables, as
well as the other risks detailed in this Form 10-Q and in the Company's 1999
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company's consolidated financial data includes
QPE and certain other consolidated subsidiaries of the Company.

OVERVIEW

   QUALCOMM is a leading provider of digital wireless communications products,
technologies and services based on the Company's technology. The Company
designs, develops, and markets CDMA chipsets and system software and designs,
develops, manufactures, and markets CDMA subscriber products. The Company also
licenses and receives royalty payments on its CDMA technology from major
domestic and international telecommunications equipment suppliers. In addition,
the Company designs, manufactures and distributes products and provides services
for its OmniTRACS system. The Company also has contracts with Globalstar to
design, develop and manufacture subscriber products and ground communications
systems utilizing CDMA technology and to provide contract development services.

   The Company's CDMA technology has been adopted as an industry standard for
digital cellular, Personal Communications Services ("PCS") and other wireless
services. Wireless networks based on the Company's current implementation of
CDMA technology, referred to as cdmaOne, have been commercially deployed or are
under development in more than 35 countries around the world, with 27 countries
already in commercial deployments. In December 1999, the CDMA Development Group
("CDG") reported that CDMA carriers now have over 41 million commercial
subscribers worldwide as of September 1999.

   QUALCOMM continues to invest in research and development projects focused on
improving current CDMA applications and products, developing and commercializing
next generation CDMA technology and products, interfacing with other digital
cellular standards, and developing and commercializing new leading edge CDMA HDR
technology, products and services. The Company believes HDR will provide a high
speed, cost-effective, fixed and mobile alternative for Internet access,
competing with digital subscriber loop, cable, and satellite networks. HDR is
designed to enable existing cdmaOne and future CDMA third-generation service
providers to obtain higher capacities and superior performance by optimizing
voice and data spectrum separately, while serving both applications from the
same access point.

   QUALCOMM has entered into a number of development and manufacturing contracts
involving the Globalstar System. QUALCOMM's development agreement provides for
the design and development of the ground communications stations, known as
gateways, and user terminals of the Globalstar System. Since telephone systems
using LEO satellites are a new commercial technology, demand for Globalstar's
service is uncertain. If Globalstar fails to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations through the marketing efforts of its service providers, it will be
unable to fund its operating costs or service its debt.



                                       16
<PAGE>   17

   The value of QUALCOMM's investment in and future business with Globalstar, as
well as QUALCOMM's ability to collect outstanding receivables from Globalstar,
depends on the success of Globalstar and the Globalstar System. See "Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4 Investments in Other
Entities."

   From time to time the Company considers strategic transactions and
alternatives with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. For example, in
September 1998, the Company completed the spin-off of Leap Wireless and in May
1999, the Company completed the sale of its terrestrial CDMA wireless
infrastructure business to Ericsson. In December 1999, the Company announced an
agreement with Kyocera relating to the sale of its terrestrial-based phone
business and in January 2000, the Company announced that it will acquire
SnapTrack. The Company will continue to evaluate other potential strategic
transactions and alternatives which management believes may enhance stockholder
value. These additional potential transactions may include a variety of
different business arrangements, including acquisitions, spin-offs, strategic
partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, divestitures, business
combinations and investments. There can be no assurance that any such
transactions will be consummated on favorable terms or at all, will in fact
enhance stockholder value or will not adversely affect the Company's business or
the trading price of our stock. Any such transaction may require the Company to
incur non-recurring or other charges and may pose significant integration
challenges and/or management and business disruptions, any of which could
materially and adversely affect the Company's business and financial results.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

   On November 24, 1999, the Company invested approximately $196 million in KT
Freetel. See "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4
Investments in Other Entities."

   In December 1999, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split of its
common stock. See "Item 4 Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders."

   On December 22, 1999, QUALCOMM announced an agreement with Kyocera that will
result in Kyocera's acquiring QUALCOMM's terrestrial-based wireless CDMA
consumer phone business. See "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements - Note 7 Disposition of Assets and Other Charges."

   On January 26, 2000, QUALCOMM announced that it will acquire SnapTrack. See
"Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 11 Subsequent
Event."

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999

   Total revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $1,120 million
compared to $941 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Revenue growth
for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 was primarily due to increased sales of
CDMA chipsets and phone products, and significant growth in royalties, offset by
the decrease in terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure product revenue as a
result of the sale of this business in May 1999. Sales to one South Korean
customer, Samsung Electronics Company, by QCT and QTL segments comprised 11% of
total revenues in first quarter of fiscal 2000.

   The Company anticipates that shipments of its phone chips in the second
quarter of fiscal 2000 may be lower than the first quarter of fiscal 2000 due to
seasonal factors, inventory balancing by customers due to continued shortages of
other phone components, and customers transitioning to next generation chips. In
addition, the Company anticipates that shipments of its handsets in the second
quarter of fiscal 2000 may be lower than the first quarter of fiscal 2000 due to
the sale of this business in the quarter, as well as seasonal factors.

   Cost of revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 was $649 million
compared to $642 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The decrease in
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues to 58% in the first quarter of
fiscal 2000 from 68% in the first quarter of fiscal 1999 primarily reflects an
increase in royalty revenue, a decrease in terrestrial CDMA wireless
infrastructure cost as a result of the sale of this business in May 1999, and
improved operational efficiencies.

   For the first quarter of fiscal 2000, research and development expenses were
$83 million or 7% of revenues, compared to $100 million or 11% of revenues for
the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The dollar and percent decreases were due to a
decrease in terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure product research and
development as a result of the sale of this business in May 1999, offset by
increased chipset product initiatives and development of HDR products.

   For the first quarter of fiscal 2000, selling, general and administrative
expenses were $102 million or 9% of revenues, compared to $121 million or 13% of
revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The dollar and percent decreases
from the first quarter of fiscal 1999 were due to a decrease in marketing
expense for terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure products as a result of the
sale of this business, offset by continued growth in personnel and associated
overhead expenses necessary to support the overall growth in the Company's
operations and increased patent and information technology expenses.

   Interest expense was $3 million for each of the first quarters of fiscal 2000
and 1999.

   Investment income, net was $36 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2000
compared to $7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The increase was
largely due to the $1 billion in cash proceeds from a stock offering in July
1999, interest from finance receivables, higher interest rates, and a change in
the estimate of amounts collectible



                                       17
<PAGE>   18

under the Globalstar development contract. See "Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements - Note 4 Investment in Other Entities."

   Distributions on Trust Convertible Preferred Securities of $11 million for
the first quarter of fiscal 2000 compared to $10 million for the first quarter
of fiscal 1999 relate to the 5 3/4% Trust Convertible Preferred Securities
outstanding. See "Item 2 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources."

   Income tax expense was $105 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2000
compared to $23 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999, resulting
primarily from higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate for the
first quarter of fiscal 2000 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 1999.
The Company's income tax provisions for the first quarters of fiscal 2000 and
1999 reflect adjustments for the retroactive reinstatements of the R&D tax
credit. Excluding the adjustments, the Company currently estimates its annual
effective income tax rate to be approximately 38% for fiscal 2000, compared to
35% for fiscal 1999. The higher tax rate is the result of higher earnings
relative to the growth of R&D tax credits.

SEGMENT RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER
OF FISCAL 1999

   The following should be read in conjunction with the first quarter financial
results of fiscal 2000 for each reporting segment. See "Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 10 Segment Information."

CDMA Technologies Segment ("QCT")

   The QCT segment is a major supplier of chipsets and software solutions to
handset and infrastructure manufacturers. QCT helps manufacturers produce
smaller and more affordable products by bringing new chipsets to the market with
more functionality in a substantially smaller package size. QCT's CDMA ASIC
products include Mobile Station Modem ("MSM") chips for telephone handsets, Cell
Site Modem ("CSM") chips for infrastructure base stations and a number of
related chips that make digital voice transmission and processing possible.

   QCT segment revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $352 million
compared to $193 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Earnings before
taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $128 million compared to $64
million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Revenue and earnings before taxes
growth was primarily due to increased customer demand for CDMA chipsets in the
United States, Korea, and Japan and to new product releases. Over 14 million MSM
chipsets were sold during the first quarter of fiscal 2000, contributing to the
significant growth in both the revenue and earnings before tax. The Company
anticipates that shipments of its phone chips in the second quarter of fiscal
2000 may be lower than the first quarter of fiscal 2000 due to seasonal factors,
inventory balancing by customers due to continued shortages of other phone
components, and customers transitioning to next generation chips.

Technology Licensing Segment ("QTL")

   QTL provides licenses to third parties related to the design, manufacture and
sale of products using the Company's technologies.

   QTL segment revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $178 million
compared to $74 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Earnings before
taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $163 million compared to $62
million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Revenue and earnings before taxes
growth was primarily due to royalties paid from licensees resulting from an
increase in worldwide demand for CDMA products.

Wireless Systems Segment ("QWS")

   QWS designs, manufactures, markets and deploys infrastructure and handset
products for use in terrestrial and non-terrestrial CDMA wireless and satellite
networks and provides satellite-based two-way data messaging, position reporting
equipment, and services to transportation companies.

   QWS segment revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $215 million
compared to $300 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Earnings before
taxes for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $66 million compared to $15
million loss for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Revenues decreased while
earnings before taxes increased due to the sale of certain assets of the
Company's terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business in May 1999 to



                                       18
<PAGE>   19

   Ericsson and the completion of production of Globalstar gateways, offset by
OmniTRACS domestic unit demand from existing customers and increase in messaging
revenue due to an increase in customer base.

Consumer Products Segment ("QCP")

   QCP designs, manufactures and markets wireless handsets and accessories using
CDMA technology for use in mobile and fixed wireless networks.

   QCP segment revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2000 were $442 million
compared to $383 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. For the first
quarter of fiscal 2000, QCP recorded a loss of $18 million compared to breaking
even for the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Revenue growth was primarily due to
an increase in demand for CDMA handsets and new product releases. Losses were a
result of declining average sales prices per handset, which were not fully
offset by decreases in related manufacturing cost. The Company anticipates that
shipments of its handsets in the second quarter of fiscal 2000 may be lower than
the first quarter of fiscal 2000 due to the sale of this business in the
quarter, as well as seasonal factors.

   QUALCOMM has entered into an agreement with Kyocera that will result in
Kyocera's acquiring QUALCOMM's terrestrial-based wireless CDMA consumer phone
business. See "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 7
Disposition of Assets and Other Charges."

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

   The Company anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents and investments
balances of $1,556 million at December 26, 1999, including interest earned
thereon, will be used to fund its working and other capital requirements,
including investments in other entities and other assets to support the growth
of its business, financing for customers of CDMA infrastructure products in
accordance with the agreement with Ericsson, and facilities related to the
expansion of the Company's operations. In the event additional needs for cash
arise, the Company may raise additional funds from a combination of sources
including potential debt and equity issuance. There can, however, be no
assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at
all. In addition, the Company's credit facility places restrictions on the
Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness which could adversely affect
its ability to raise additional capital through debt financing.

   The Company has an unsecured credit facility under which banks are committed
to make up to $400 million in revolving loans to the Company. The facility
expires in March 2001 and may be extended on an annual basis upon maturity. The
Company is currently obligated to pay commitment fees equal to 0.175% per annum
on the unused amount of the facility. The facility includes certain restrictive
financial and operating covenants. At December 26, 1999, there were no amounts
or letters of credit issued or outstanding under the facility.

   In the first quarter of fiscal 2000, $81 million in cash was provided by
operating activities, compared to $138 million used by operating activities in
the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Cash provided by operating activities in the
first quarter of fiscal 2000 includes $350 million of net cash flow provided by
operations offset by $269 million of net working capital requirements. The
improved cash flow from operations primarily reflects the increase in net income
resulting from increased revenues and gross margins. Net working capital
requirements of $269 million primarily reflect increases in accounts receivable,
finance receivables, and other current assets. The increases in accounts and
finance receivables in the first quarter of fiscal 2000 result from the
continued growth in products and component sales and the deferral of contract
payments under the development agreement with Globalstar.

   Investments in capital expenditures and other entities and issuance of notes
receivable totaled $304 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, compared to
$95 million in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Significant components in first
quarter of fiscal 2000 consisted of the purchase of $38 million of capital
assets, the investment of $121 million in entities in which the Company holds
less than a 50% interest, and the issuance of $146 million in notes receivable.
The Company expects to continue making significant investments in capital
assets, including new facilities and building improvements, and in other
entities throughout fiscal 2000.

   In the first quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company's financing activities
provided $42 million, including $31 million from the issuance of common stock
under the Company's stock option and employee stock purchase plans and $12
million in net borrowing under bank lines of credit. In the first quarter of
fiscal 1999, the Company's financing activities provided net cash of $144
million, including $8 million from the issuance of common stock under the
Company's stock option and employee stock purchase plans and $137 million in net
borrowing under bank lines of credit.

   The Company is finalizing negotiations with Globalstar which will result in
the financing of current and future contract payments. See "Notes to Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4 Investments in Other Entities."

   On October 29, 1999, the Company and Pegaso Telecomunicaciones ("Pegaso")
executed a commitment letter, subject to Pegaso shareholder approval, in which
the Company agreed to underwrite up to $500 million of debt financing to Pegaso
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pegaso Comunicaciones y Sistemas, a CDMA
wireless operating company in Mexico. The debt financing would consist of a $250
million senior secured facility and a $250 million unsecured facility. The
Company currently has guaranteed a $100 million facility that would be
refinanced by the $250 million senior secured facility. The debt facilities are
expected to have final maturities of seven to eight years.

   During the first quarter of fiscal 2000, 7,793,182 Trust Convertible
Preferred Securities were converted into 42,906,040 shares of common stock. The
conversions resulted in a $390 million reduction in the recorded obligation to
Trust Convertible Preferred Securities holders. On January 6, 2000, the Company
announced its intention to redeem its remaining 5,397,908 outstanding Trust
Convertible Preferred Securities as of March 6, 2000. The redemption price is
$51 per share plus accrued interest. The holders of the Trust Convertible
Preferred Securities have the option to convert each such security into 5.5056
shares of the Company's common stock and 0.17205 shares of the common stock of
Leap Wireless. The Company expects substantially all holders to convert the
Trust Convertible Preferred Securities rather than allow redemption.

   Information regarding the Company's financial commitments at December 26,
1999 is provided in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements. See "Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 2
Composition of Certain Balance Sheet Captions and Note 9 Commitments and
Contingencies."

YEAR 2000

   The Company has completed its Year 2000 ("Y2K") Project ("Project") as
scheduled, including addressing leap year calendar date calculation concerns.
The possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations has been
reduced. As of January 27, 2000, the Company's products, computing, and
communications infrastructure systems have operated without Y2K related problems
and appear to be Y2K ready. The Company is not aware that any of its major
customers or third-party suppliers have experienced significant Y2K related
problems.

   The Company believes all its critical systems are Y2K ready. However, there
is no guarantee that the Company has discovered all possible failure points.
Specific factors contributing to this uncertainty include failure to identify
all systems, non-ready third parties whose systems and operations impact the
Company, and other similar uncertainties.

   Contingency plans are complete and will be implemented if required. Should a
significant problem occur, the Company would revert to standard manual
contingency procedures to continue operation until the problem is corrected.

   To date, the Company has spent an estimated $20 million on this Project. The
funding for this Project comes from operations and working capital. The Company
estimates the allocable time of employees using average hourly rates for each
class of employee. None of the Company's other mission critical information
projects has been delayed due to the implementation of the Y2K Project.

   The Company identified and fixed several Y2K system bugs. In addition, the
Company received other benefits from the Y2K Project, including acceleration of
the development of alternative sourcing for our supply base risk mitigation
plans which are valid and beneficial to long term supply assurance, refinement
of the Company's Disaster Recovery Plan, improvement of diagnostic procedures
for core information technology services and asset management, and establishment
of a more consistent computer desktop environment which should ultimately reduce
support costs.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

   In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133 ("FAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."
In May 1999, the FASB voted to delay the effective date of FAS 133 by one year.
The Company will be required to adopt FAS 133 for fiscal year 2001. This
statement establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging
activities. Under FAS 133, all



                                       20
<PAGE>   21

derivatives must be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair
value. The Company has not completed its determination of the impact of the
adoption of this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial position
or results of operations.

MARKET RISK

   Discussion and analysis of the Company's market risks is described in the
Company's 1999 Form 10-K. At December 26, 1999, there have been no other
material changes to the market risks described at September 26, 1999.
Additionally, the Company does not anticipate any near-term changes in the
nature of its market risk exposures or in management's objectives and strategies
with respect to managing such exposures.

               (a) SEPTEMBER STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS. The Seller has prepared
and delivered to the Purchaser a schedule of specified assets and liabilities of
the Business as of the close of business on September 26, 1999 attached hereto
as Section 2.7 of the Disclosure Schedule (the "September Statement Of Net
Assets"), which the Seller represents was prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Annual Financial
Statements, reflecting only the book value of the Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities (as the same shall exist as of September 26, 1999) and eliminating
the book value of the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities (as the same
shall exist as of September 26, 1999), except that the September Statement Of
Net Assets does not present the operating leases of the Business in accordance
with U.S. GAAP and includes the Excluded Assets described in subparagraphs (a),
(b) and (c) of the definition of "Closing Statement Credits." The specified net
assets of the Business as of September 26, 1999 (the "September Net Book Value")
shall be calculated as the excess of the book value of the Assets as of
September 26, 1999 over the book value of the Assumed Liabilities as of
September 26, 1999; provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties agree that the book value of certain Assets will be reflected in the
September Net Book Value in accordance with the following methodologies:[***]

               (b) CLOSING STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS. As promptly as practicable,
but in any event within 60 calendar days following the Closing Date, the Seller
shall at its expense prepare and deliver to the Purchaser a schedule of
specified assets and liabilities of the Business as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing Statement Of Net
Assets") prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent
with the preparation of the September Statement of Net Assets (except that the
Closing Statement of Net Assets will not present the operating leases of the
Business in accordance with U.S. GAAP and will exclude the Excluded Assets
described in subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) of the definition of Closing
Statement Credits), reflecting only the book value of the Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities (as the same shall exist as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date) and eliminating the book value of the
Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities (as the same shall exist as of the
close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date), together
with (i) a report thereon of the Seller's Accountants stating that the Closing
Statement of Net Assets fairly presents the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
at the Closing Date in accordance with U.S. GAAP (the "Accountant's Report"),
and (ii) a certification of the chief financial officer or chief accounting
officer of the Seller to the effect that the Closing Statement of Net Assets has
been prepared in compliance with the requirements

of this Section 2.7. The Purchaser and the Parent Corporation will use
reasonable commercial efforts to cooperate in any audit conducted by the
Seller's Accountants in connection with the preparation of the Accountant's
Report, including but not limited to providing to Seller's Accountants any
necessary engagement letters and management representation letters as are
customary and appropriate. The specified net assets of the Business as of the
close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the
"Closing Net Book Value") shall be calculated as the excess of the book value of
the Assets reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets over the book value
of the Assumed Liabilities reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that
the book value of certain Assets will be reflected in the Closing Net Book Value
in accordance with the methodologies set forth in Section 2.7(a).

               (c) DISPUTES.

                       (i) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.7(c), the
Closing Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser shall
be deemed to be and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto.

                       (ii) The Purchaser may dispute any amounts reflected on
the Closing Statement of Net Assets to the extent the net effect of such
disputed amounts in the aggregate would affect the Closing Net Book Value
reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets by more than [***] of the
Closing Net Book Value (the "Dispute Threshold"), but only on the basis that the
amounts reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets were not arrived at in
accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the September Statement of Net Assets (other than with respect to the treatment
of operating leases and other than with respect to those items described in the
definition of Closing Statement Credits) or that the amounts reflected thereon
do not properly adjust to include only the book value of the Assets and the
Assumed Liabilities and to eliminate the book value of the Excluded Assets and
the Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall have
notified the Seller and the Seller's Accountants in writing of each disputed
item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth, in reasonable
detail, the basis for such dispute, within twenty (20) Business Days of the
later of the Seller's delivery of the Closing Statement of Net Assets and the
Seller's delivery of the Accountant's Report to the Purchaser. In the event of
such a dispute, the Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants shall
attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
If any such resolutions by the Purchaser's Accountants and the Seller's
Accountants leaves in dispute amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate
would not affect the Closing Net Book Value reflected on the Closing Statement
of Net Assets by more than the Dispute Threshold, all such amounts remaining in
dispute shall then be deemed to have been resolved in favor of the Closing
Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser. If the
Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants are unable to reach a
resolution with respect to all amounts in dispute within ten Business Days after
receipt by the Purchaser and the Purchaser's Accountants of the Seller's written
notice of dispute, the Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants
shall submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent
accounting firm of international reputation mutually acceptable to the Purchaser
and the Seller (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), which shall, within ten
Business Days after such submission, determine and report to the Purchaser and
the Seller upon

such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Seller and the Purchaser.

                       (iii) In acting under this Agreement, the Purchaser's
Accountants, the Seller's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall
be entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

                       (iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Section 2.7(c), no adjustment to the Closing Net Book Value reflected on
the Closing Statement of Net Assets pursuant to this Section 2.7(c) shall be
made with respect to amounts disputed by the Purchaser pursuant to this Section
2.7(c), unless the net effect of the amounts successfully disputed by the
Purchaser (by resolution of the Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's
Accountants and, if applicable, by determination of the Independent Accounting
Firm) in the aggregate is to decrease the Closing Net Book Value reflected on
the Closing Statement of Net Assets by at least the amount of the Dispute
Threshold, in which case such adjustment shall be made in the full amount of
such amounts successfully disputed by the Purchaser.

                       (v) The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm, if any, shall be borne by (A) the Purchaser, if the net effect
of the amounts successfully disputed by the Purchaser in the aggregate is to
decrease the Closing Net Book Value reflected on the Closing Statement of Net
Assets by less than the amount of the Dispute Threshold, and (B) by the Seller,
if the net effect of the amounts successfully disputed by the Purchaser in the
aggregate is to decrease the Closing Net Book Value reflected on the Closing
Statement of Net Assets by at least the amount of the Dispute Threshold.

               (d) PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. The Closing Net Book Value shall
be deemed final (the "Final Closing Net Book Value") for the purposes of this
Section 2.7 upon the earlier of (i) the failure of the Purchaser to notify the
Seller of a dispute within 20 Business Days of the later of the Seller's
delivery of the Closing Statement of Net Assets to the Purchaser and the
Seller's delivery of the Accountant's Report to the Purchaser, (ii) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.7(c)(ii), by the Purchaser's
and the Seller's Accountants and (iii) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant
to Section 2.7(c)(ii), by the Independent Accounting Firm. Within three Business
Days of the Closing Statement of Net Assets being deemed final, a Purchase Price
adjustment shall be made as follows:

                       (i) in the event that the September Net Book Value
reflected on the September Statement of Net Assets exceeds the Final Closing Net
Book Value, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward in an amount
equal to such excess, and the Seller shall, within three Business Days of such
determination, pay such amount, together with interest thereon, from the Closing
Date through the date of payment at the rate of interest publicly announced by
Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto in New York, New York from time to time
as its reference rate from the Closing Date to the date of such payment, to the
Purchaser by wire transfer in immediately available funds; and

                       (ii) in the event that the Final Closing Net Book Value
exceeds the September Net Book Value reflected on the September Statement of Net
Assets, then the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal to
such excess and the Purchaser



                                       18
<PAGE>   24







shall, within three Business Days of such determination, pay the amount of such
excess together with interest thereon, from the Closing Date through the date of
payment at the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A. or any
successor thereto in New York, New York from time to time as its reference rate
from the Closing Date to the date of such payment, to the Seller by wire
transfer in immediately available funds.

               (e) PRORATIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Section 2.7, the parties agree that the following expenses shall
(to the extent not otherwise already reflected in the Closing Date Statement) be
prorated. All personal property taxes and assessments which are past due on the
Assets will be paid by the Seller on or before the Closing Date together with
any penalty or interest thereon. Utility fees, current personal property taxes,
classified telephone book advertising, real property taxes with respect to real
property leased pursuant to the Lease Agreements, and all other costs and
expenses paid by any Selling Party which relate directly to the day-to-day
operation of the Business after the Closing Date and which will materially
benefit the Purchaser in its day-to-day operation of the Business, will be
prorated and adjusted between the Purchaser and the Seller as of 12:01 a.m. on
the Closing Date on a due date basis. If current tax bills are unavailable on
the Closing Date, the prior year's tax bills will be used for proration purposes
and taxes will be re-prorated between the Purchaser and the Seller when the
current tax bills are received.

       2.8 ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. The sum of the Purchase Price (and
all other capitalized costs) shall be allocated among the Assets as agreed upon
between the Purchaser and the Seller prior to Closing. Any subsequent
adjustments to the sum of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities shall be
reflected in the allocation hereunder in a manner consistent with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1060-1T(f). For all purposes (including tax, financial and
accounting), the Purchaser and the Seller agree to report the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this
Agreement and that neither of them will take any position inconsistent therewith
in any Tax return, in any refund claim, in any litigation, or otherwise without
the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

Selling Party is a corporation or other entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and has
all necessary corporate and authority to enter into the Selling Party Documents
to which it is a party, to carry out its obligations thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. Each Selling Party is duly
licensed or qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the Assets owned or leased by it or the operation of the
Business makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except to the extent
that the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not materially adversely
affect (a) the ability of such Selling Party to carry out its obligations under,
and to consummate



                                       19

Party of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite action on the part of such Selling Party. No approval of the
stockholders of any Selling Party is required in connection with the execution
and delivery of any Selling Party Documents by any Selling Party, the
performance by any Selling Party of its obligations thereunder or the
consummation by any Selling Party of the transactions contemplated thereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Seller and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchaser, this Agreement
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller enforceable
against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be
limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, debtor relief or similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally and (b) general principles of
equity, including specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. The Selling Party Documents to which it is a party will be duly
executed and delivered by each Selling Party, and (assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Purchaser) the Selling Party Documents to which it
is a party will constitute, legal, valid and binding obligations of such Selling
Party enforceable against such Selling Party in accordance with their respective
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, debtor relief or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and (b) general principles of equity, including specific performance,
injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

       3.2 NO CONFLICT. Assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations
and other actions described in Section 3.3 have been obtained and all filings
and notifications listed in Section 3.3 of the Disclosure Schedule have been

(or similar organizational documents) of such Selling Party, (b) conflict with
or violate (or cause an event which could have a Material Adverse Effect as a
result of) any Law or Governmental Order applicable to such Selling Party or the
Assets or the Business, or (c) except for the required consents described in

time, or both, would become a default) under, require any consent under, or give
to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration, suspension,
revocation or cancellation of, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance on
any of the Assets pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage or indenture, contract,
agreement, lease, sublease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
arrangement to which such Selling Party is a party or by which any of the Assets
is bound or affected, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c), as would not
have a Material Adverse Effect and would not prevent or materially delay

Authority).

as otherwise described in Section 3.18(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, no Actions
have been made or asserted or are pending (nor, to the best knowledge of the

and enforceable leases or other rights to use, without payment of any fee other

necessary third party lessor consents.

Schedule) such assets as are necessary in the conduct of the Business. All items
of Tangible Personal Property included within the Assets are in good operating

purposes for which they are used and intended.

               (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.21(c) of the Disclosure
Schedule, each Selling Party has the complete and unrestricted power and
unqualified right to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver its Specific

other fees imposed as a result of, or arising from, the consummation of the

       3.22 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT MATTERS.

               (a) PLANS AND MATERIAL DOCUMENTS. Section 3.22(a) of the

3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
("ERISA")) and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock,
incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or
arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other contracts or
agreements, whether legally enforceable or not, to which each Selling Party is a
party, with respect to which any Selling Party has any obligation or which are
maintained, contributed to or sponsored by any Selling Party for the benefit of
any of its current or former employees, officers or directors, (ii) each
employee benefit plan for which any Selling Party could incur liability under
Section 4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be terminated,
(iii) any plan in respect of which any Selling Party could incur liability under
Section 4212(c) of ERISA and (iv) any contracts, arrangements or understandings
between any Selling Party or any of its Affiliates and any employee of any
Selling Party including, without limitation, any contracts, arrangements or
understandings relating to a sale of the Business (collectively, the "Plans").
Each Plan is in writing and the Seller has furnished the Purchaser with a true
and complete copy of each Plan and a true and complete copy of each material
document prepared in connection with each such Plan as follows: (i) a copy of
each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii) each summary plan description and



                                       30
<PAGE>   36


summary of material modifications, (iii) the most recently filed IRS Form 5500,
(iv) the most recently received IRS determination letter for each such Plan, and
(v) the most recently prepared actuarial report and financial statement in
connection with each such Plan. Except as disclosed on Section 3.22(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule, there are no other employee benefit plans, programs,
arrangements or agreements, whether formal or informal, whether in writing or
not, to which any Selling Party is a party, with respect to which any Selling
Party has any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by
any Selling Party for the benefit of any of its current or former employees,
officers or directors. No Selling Party has any express or implied commitment,
whether legally enforceable or not, (i) to create, incur liability with respect
to or cause to exist any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement,
(ii) to enter into any contract or agreement to provide compensation or benefits
to any individual or (iii) to modify, change or terminate any Plan, other than
with respect to a modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the
Code.

               (b) ABSENCE OF CERTAIN TYPES OF PLANS. None of the Plans is a
multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)
(a "Multiemployer Plan"). None of the Plans is subject to Title IV of ERISA.
None of the Plans provides for the payment of separation, severance, termination
or similar-type benefits to any Person or obligates any Selling Party to pay
separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits (i) solely as a
result of any transaction contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements or (ii) as a result of a "change in the ownership or effective
control" or a "change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets"
of any Selling Party, within the meaning of such term under Section 280G of the
Code. None of the Plans provides for or promises retiree medical, retiree
disability or retiree life insurance benefits to any current or former employee,
officer or director of any Selling Party. No Selling Party maintains or
contributes to a voluntary employees' beneficiary association which is intended
to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.
Each of the Plans is subject only to the laws of the United States or a
political subdivision thereof.

               (c) COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. Each Plan is operated in all
material respects, in both form and operation, in accordance with the
requirements of all applicable Laws, including, without limitation, ERISA and
the Code. No Selling Party nor any ERISA Affiliate of a Selling Party (as
hereinafter defined) has incurred (nor has any event occurred or condition been
incurred or a claim been threatened which reasonably can be expected to result
in a Selling Party or an ERISA Affiliate of a Selling Party incurring) any
material obligation or liability in connection with any existing or previously
existing employee benefit plan which could become an obligation or liability of
Purchaser or give rise to a lien on any of the Assets. For purposes thereof, the
term "ERISA Affiliate" means a Person which, together with a Selling Party, are
treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code.

               (d) QUALIFICATION OF CERTAIN PLANS. Each Plan which is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified and, to the knowledge
of the Seller, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Plan (or the exempt status of any trust thereunder).





                                       31

               (e) PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS AND FUNDING. All contributions, premiums
or payments required to be made with respect to any Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for
income tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by
any Governmental Authority and, to the knowledge of the Seller, no fact or event
exists which could give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, the Seller will not and will
not suffer or permit the occurrence of (a)

any of the things enumerated in the second sentence of Section 3.14 or (b) the

a period of seven years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall (i) retain the
books and records of each Selling Party which are transferred to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement relating to periods prior to or following the Closing
in a manner reasonably consistent with the prior practices of each Selling
Party, and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the officers, employees,
authorized agents, accountants, counsel and representatives of any Selling Party
reasonable access (including the right to make photocopies at such Selling
Party's expense), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

               (c) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by
or against or incurred by the Purchaser after the Closing, for a period of seven
years following the Closing, the Seller shall (i) retain all books and records

the respective agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and
directors of the Seller and each Selling Party to: (i) treat and hold as

information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent or trademark
applications, product development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing

in the event that the Seller, any Selling Party or any such agent,
representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or director becomes legally
compelled to disclose any such information, provide the Purchaser with prompt

                                       36
<PAGE>   42







Purchaser may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with
this Section 5.3; (iii) in the event that such protective order or other remedy

furnish only that portion of such confidential information which is legally
required to be provided and exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such information; and
(iv) promptly furnish (prior to, at, or as soon as practicable following, the
Closing) to the Purchaser any and all copies (in whatever form or medium) of all
such confidential information then in the possession of the Seller or any
Selling Party or any of the agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees,
officers and directors or the Seller or any Selling Party and destroy any and
all additional copies then in the possession of such Persons of such information
and of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents prepared, in whole
or in part, on the basis thereof; provided, however, that this sentence shall
not apply to any information that, at the time of disclosure, is available
publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by the Seller, any
Selling Party, or the agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers
or directors of the Seller or any Selling Party; provided, further, that
specific information shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exception
merely because it is embraced in general disclosures in the public domain. In
addition, any combination of features shall not be deemed to be within the
foregoing exception merely because the individual features are in the public
domain unless the combination itself and its principle of operation are in the
public domain.

               (b) The Purchaser agrees to, and shall cause its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to: (i) treat and
hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any Person to) all
information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent or trademark
applications, product development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing
and marketing plans, policies and strategies, operations methods, product
development techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition
plans and any other confidential information obtained by the Purchaser pursuant
to the Confidentiality Agreement and not related to the Business; (ii) in the
event that the Purchaser or any such agent, representative, Affiliate, employee,
officer or director becomes legally compelled to disclose any such information,
provide the Seller with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the
Seller may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this
Section 5.3; (iii) in the event that such protective order or other remedy is
not obtained, or the Seller waives compliance with this Section 5.3, furnish
only that portion of such confidential information which is legally required to

furnish (prior to, at, or as soon as practicable following, the Closing) to the
Seller any and all copies (in whatever form or medium) of all such confidential

representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors and destroy any
and all additional copies then in the possession of the Purchaser or any of its
agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors of such
information and of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents
prepared, in whole or in part, on the basis thereof; provided, however, that
this sentence shall not apply to any information that, at the time of
disclosure, is available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this
Agreement by the Purchaser, its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees,
officers or directors; provided, further, that specific information shall not be
deemed to be within the foregoing exception merely because it is embraced in
general disclosures in the public domain. In addition, any combination of
features shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exception merely because
the individual features



                                       37
<PAGE>   43







are in the public domain unless the combination itself and its principle of
operation are in the public domain.

               (c) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that remedies at Law for any breach of its obligations under this Section 5.3
are inadequate and that in addition thereto a party shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of
any such breach, without the necessity of demonstrating the inadequacy of money
damages or the posting of any bond or similar security.

               (d) Upon consummation of the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate without any further action on the part of the
Purchaser or the Seller.

       5.4 REGULATORY AND OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS; NOTICES AND CONSENTS.

               (a) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate fully with the
other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, but in any event within fifteen
(15) Business Days of the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as practicable
to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act.
Notwithstanding the forgoing provisions of this Section 5.4(a), no party shall
be required to take any action in connection with obtaining any such
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals to the extent doing so would have
a material adverse effect on its business or the Business.

               (b) The Seller shall give promptly such notices to third parties
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all such third party consents that
are necessary or desirable in connection with the transfer of the Material
Contracts. The Purchaser shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
assist the Seller in giving such notices and obtaining such consents; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or
other consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice or consent
or to consent to any change in the terms of any Material Contract which the
Purchaser in its sole discretion may deem adverse to the interests of the
Purchaser or the Business.

               (c) The Seller and the Purchaser agree that, in the event any
consent, approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the
Business or the Purchaser any right or benefit under any lease, license,
contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement to which a Selling Party
is a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Seller will, and if
applicable, will cause a Selling Party to, subsequent to the Closing, cooperate
with the Purchaser in attempting to obtain such consent, approval or
authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If such consent, approval
or authorization cannot be obtained, the Seller will and if applicable, will
cause a Selling Party to, use its reasonable best efforts to provide the
Purchaser with the rights and benefits of the affected lease, license, contract,
commitment or other agreement or arrangement for the term of such lease,
license, contract or other agreement or



                                       38
<PAGE>   44







arrangement (including remaining as a party thereto and passing the benefits
thereof to the Purchaser), and, if the Seller provides such rights and benefits,
the Purchaser shall assume the obligations and burdens thereunder.

               (d) The Seller and the Purchaser agree to cooperate with each
other (i) in providing to the Purchaser, on commercially reasonable terms and
for purposes of conducting the Business, the benefit of any asset or right that
is currently used in the Business and that is not effectively transferred to the
Purchaser under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) in providing
to the Seller, on commercially reasonable terms and for purposes of conducting
the businesses of the Seller as of the date hereof other than the Business, the
benefit of any asset or right that is currently used in such businesses and that
is transferred to the Purchaser under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements.

               (e) The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in preparing a
comprehensive list prior to the Closing of all Permits that are non-transferable
or which will require the consent of any Governmental Authority in order to be
transferred to the Purchaser in the event of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Seller agrees that it will, and if
applicable, will cause a Selling Party to, reasonably cooperate with the
Purchaser in attempting to transfer those Permits which are transferable and to
reasonably cooperate to obtain such Permits which are not transferable, in each
case, as soon as practicable following the delivery of the foregoing list to the
Purchaser.

       5.5 NOTICE OF DEVELOPMENTS.

               (a) Prior to the Closing, the Seller shall promptly notify the
Purchaser in writing of (i) all events, circumstances, facts and occurrences
arising subsequent to the date of this Agreement which would reasonably be
expected to result in any material breach of a representation or warranty or
covenant of the Seller in this Agreement or which would reasonably be expected
to have the effect of making any representation or warranty of the Seller in
this Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect, and (ii) all other
material adverse developments affecting the Assets, Liabilities, business,
financial condition, operations, results of operations, customer or supplier
relations, employee relations, projections or prospects of the Seller or the
Business.

               (b) Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Seller in writing of all events, circumstances, facts and occurrences arising
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which would reasonably be expected to
result in any material breach of a representation or warranty or covenant of the
Purchaser in this Agreement or which would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of making any representation or warranty of the Purchaser in this
Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect.

       5.6 NO SOLICITATION OR NEGOTIATION. The Seller agrees that between the
date of this Agreement and the earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) the
termination of this Agreement, neither the Seller nor any of its respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, representatives or agents will (a) solicit,
initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or offers from any
Person relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the
Assets or the Business (other than (i) Inventory to be sold in the ordinary
course of the Business consistent with past practice



                                       39
<PAGE>   45







and (ii) proposals or offers related to the acquisition of all or substantially
all of the assets or capital stock of the Seller in a transaction subject to the
prior rights of the Purchaser under this Agreement related to the acquisition of
the Assets and the Business), or (b) participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations or other communications regarding, or furnish to any
other Person any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way,
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any
other Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. The Seller immediately shall
cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations,
negotiations and other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing. Subject to confidentiality agreements binding
upon the Seller as of the date hereof, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser
promptly if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any
Person with respect thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to the
Purchaser, indicate in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such
proposal, offer, inquiry or contact and the material terms and conditions of
such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact. The Seller agrees not to,
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, release any Person from, or
waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the
Seller is a party and which is primarily related to a potential acquisition of
all or any portion of the Assets or the Business, and the Seller agrees to send,
promptly after the date of this Agreement, requests to all parties under such
agreements to return or destroy confidential information obtained from the
Seller thereunder related to the Assets or the Business.

       5.7 CERTAIN MATTERS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

               (a) Effective as of the Closing, Seller grants, and shall cause
its Affiliates to grant, to the Purchaser a perpetual, nonexclusive,
nontransferable (except for sublicenses to Affiliates of Purchaser), world-wide,
royalty free license under all of Qualcomm's Intellectual Property that is
necessary to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, lease or otherwise
dispose of products of the Business (including all current product lines and
accessories manufactured by the Business) (hereafter the "Licensed Intellectual
Property").

               (b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and provide all notices
required under the terms of any Subscriber Business IP License to be obtained or
provided in order to assign to Purchaser all of Seller's and its Affiliates'
right, title and interest in and to such Subscriber Business IP License. Seller
and Purchaser agree that, in the event a required consent to the assignment and
transfer to Purchaser of any Subscriber Business IP License is not obtained
prior to the Closing, then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such consent thereafter. If a consent under a Subscriber Business IP
License is not obtained, then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to provide Purchaser with the rights and benefits of such Subscriber Business IP
License and if Seller provides such rights and benefits, Purchaser shall assume
the obligations and burdens thereunder; provided, however, that the parties
acknowledge that Seller shall not be obligated to pay any consideration or agree
to any modification or amendment of any term of any agreement or contract in
connection with the obligations of Seller under this Section 5.7(b). Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts in cooperating and assisting Seller in
obtaining such consents, providing such notices and otherwise carrying out the
obligations of Seller under this Section 5.7(b).





                                       40
<PAGE>   46







               (c) Subject to the limitations contained in the next sentence of
this Section 5.7(c), effective as of the Closing, Seller grants, and shall cause
its Affiliates to grant, to Purchaser a nonexclusive sublicense to use all
Shared Third Party Intellectual Property in the conduct of the Business;
provided, that, to the extent Seller is obligated to make royalty or other
payments to any third party under any license or sublicense agreement covering
any Shared Third Party Intellectual Property which royalties or other payments
relate to or arise out of the use of such Shared Third Party Intellectual
Property by Purchaser in the conduct of the Business, such payment obligations
shall be passed through to Purchaser. In the event Seller or an Affiliate of
Seller is unable to provide a sublicense to Purchaser with respect to any Shared
Third Party Intellectual Property (whether because Seller or such Affiliate is
prohibited under the terms of any license or sublicense agreement or otherwise),
then Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain for Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in obtaining, a license or sublicense
in favor of Purchaser from the licensor of such Shared Third Party Intellectual
Property; provided, that, Purchaser acknowledges that any such license or
sublicense may be subject to negotiations between Purchaser and any such
licensor and may contain terms and conditions that are different than the terms
and conditions contained in any license or sublicense agreement between Seller
and the licensor of any such Shared Third Party Intellectual Property; provided,
further, that neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall be obligated to
agree to any modification or amendment of any term of any agreement or contract
granting to Seller or an Affiliate of Seller a license or sublicense to any
Shared Third Party Intellectual Property. In the event that Seller and Purchaser
are unable to obtain for Purchaser a license or sublicense to any Shared Third
Party Intellectual Property, then Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Purchaser with Seller's or its Affiliate's rights to and
benefits of such Shared Third Party Intellectual Property and if Purchaser
receives such rights and benefits, Purchaser shall assume the obligations and
burdens thereunder. Purchaser agrees to negotiate in good faith the terms and
conditions of any license or sublicense agreement to be entered into between
Purchaser and the licensor of any Shared Third Party Intellectual Property
pursuant to this Section 5.7(c) and to otherwise relieve Seller of its
obligations under this Section 5.7(c).

               (d) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser grants to Seller a
perpetual, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense to any Affiliate
of Seller) to use the Owned Intellectual Property (and the right to grant
sublicenses to use which are deemed to be granted to purchasers of products and
licensees of associated software (whether or not embedded therein) of the Seller
or its Affiliates in connection with the use of the products purchased and
associated software licensed) and the customer lists (which rights to the
customer lists may not be sublicensed by Seller to any Person other than to
affiliates of Seller) being sold and transferred to Purchaser pursuant to
Section 2.1(a)(vi) and Section 2.1(a)(x), respectively, as each respectively
exists as of the Closing Date to commercially exploit the Excluded Assets, to
fulfill its obligations under all Excluded Liabilities (including any
obligations under any contracts or agreements to which Seller or its Affiliates
are a party as of the Closing Date), and otherwise in the conduct of any
business of Seller or its Affiliates other than the Business. Except as
contemplated by the foregoing sentence or as contemplated by the Ancillary
Agreements, from and after the Closing, Seller shall not use any of the Owned
Intellectual Property or customer lists being sold and transferred to Purchaser
pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(vi) (other than software not customized for the
Business) and Section 2.1(a)(x), respectively.





                                       41
<PAGE>   47







               (e) Subject to the limitations contained in the next sentence of
this Section 5.7(e), effective as of the Closing, Purchaser grants to Seller a
nonexclusive sublicense (with the right to sublicense to Affiliates of Seller)
to use all Intellectual Property covered by the Subscriber Business IP Licenses
to commercially exploit the Excluded Assets, to fulfill its obligations under
all Excluded Liabilities (including any obligations under any contracts or
agreements to which Seller or its Affiliates are a party as of the Closing
Date), and otherwise in the conduct of any business of Seller or its Affiliates
other than the Business; provided, that, to the extent Purchaser is obligated to
make royalty or other payments to any third party under any Subscriber Business
IP Licenses that are transferred to Purchaser which royalties or other payments
relate to or arise out of the use by Seller of any Intellectual Property covered
by such Subscriber Business IP License in the conduct of any business of Seller
other than the Business, such payment obligations shall be passed through to
Seller. In the event Purchaser is unable to provide a sublicense to Seller under
any Subscriber Business IP License that is transferred to Purchaser (whether
because Purchaser is prohibited under the terms of any license or sublicense
agreement or otherwise), then Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain for Seller, and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in
obtaining, a license or sublicense in favor of Seller from the licensor with
respect to the Intellectual Property covered by such Subscriber Business IP
License; provided, that, Seller acknowledges that any such license or sublicense
may be subject to negotiations between Seller and any such licensor and may
contain terms and conditions that are different than the terms and conditions
contained in any such Subscriber Business IP License transferred to Purchaser;
provided, further, that Purchaser shall not be obligated to agree to any
modification or amendment of any term of any Subscriber Business IP License
transferred to Purchaser. In the event that Seller and Purchaser are unable to
obtain for Seller a license or sublicense to any Intellectual Property covered
by any Subscriber Business IP License, then Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide Seller with the rights to and benefits of such
Intellectual Property and if Seller receives such rights and benefits, Seller
shall assume the obligations and burdens thereunder. Seller agrees to negotiate
in good faith the terms and conditions of any license or sublicense agreement to
be entered into between Seller and the licensor of any Intellectual Property
covered by a Subscriber Business IP License that is transferred to Purchaser and
to otherwise relieve Purchaser of its obligations under this Section 5.7(e).

               (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, effective as of the Closing, the Licensed Intellectual Property
created or acquired by the Seller prior to July 3, 1995 shall be deemed
"Included Commercially Necessary IPR" as that term is defined in the Existing
License Agreement, and the use by the Purchaser and its Affiliates of such
Licensed Intellectual Property shall be governed by the terms and conditions of
the Existing License Agreement.

               (g) Seller shall, not later than January 31, 2000, provide to
Purchaser a schedule of all contracts and agreements to which any Selling Party
is a party relating to (i) the Subscriber Business IP Licenses, (ii) the Shared
Third Party Intellectual Property, and (iii) all other software licensed or
sublicensed by a Selling Party from a third party, other than Excluded
Intellectual Property and commercially available, over-the-counter "shrink-wrap"
software.

               (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.7 or in any other provision of this Agreement, no transfer of, or
grant of any license or other right to,



                                       42

any patents or patent applications are made or granted hereunder to Purchaser,
other than rights to design patents and design patent applications specifically
granted to Purchaser hereunder.

       5.9 EXCLUDED LIABILITIES. The Seller shall pay and discharge the Excluded
Liabilities as and when the same become due and payable.

       5.10 BULK TRANSFER LAWS. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges that no
Selling Party has taken, or intends to take, any action required to comply with
any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws or similar laws, and the
Purchaser hereby waives compliance by any Selling Party with any applicable bulk
sale or bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale of
the Assets to the Purchaser (other than any obligations with respect to the
application of the proceeds herefrom). The Seller agrees to pay and discharge

loss for such period, and (ii) within three Business Days following an agreement
between the Seller and the Purchaser that an indemnity amount is payable, an

               (c) The Seller and the Purchaser shall share equally any real
property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer,
and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration, and other fees, and any
similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Seller, after
review and consent by the Purchaser, shall file such applications and documents
as shall permit any such Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing
Date in accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedure. The Purchaser
shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable
the Seller to comply with the foregoing. The Purchaser shall complete and

for under federal, state, local or foreign Tax laws to prevent the Purchaser
from being liable as a transferee for Taxes of the Seller.

               (e) The Seller and the Purchaser agree to treat all payments made
by either to or for the benefit of the other under this Section 5.11 and any
other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any misrepresentations or
breach of warranties or covenants, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the
extent that the laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which
case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the
relevant party on an after-Tax basis.

               (f) The Seller shall, on or before June 30, 2000, provide to the
Purchaser such information and substantiating documentation, as required under

Purchaser to receive the benefits following the Closing of all letters of
credit, performance bonds and similar



                                       45

obligations that have been issued in favor of or for the benefit of the Seller
under any Transferred Customer Contracts (whether through the assignment
thereof, the issuance of a replacement letter of credit, guaranty or otherwise).

               (c) Seller shall, subsequent to the Closing, provide to Purchaser
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser that, with respect to assets
previously owned or held by QUALCOMM Personal Electronics which are included
within the Assets, (i) all liens on such Assets have been terminated and
released, and (ii) all equipment leases encumbering such Assets have been fully
paid and are no longer in force or effect.

       5.13 SUBSCRIBER BUSINESS RECEIVABLES.

               (a) Purchaser agrees to cooperate in good faith with Seller, at
the Seller's expense, in assisting Seller in the collection of the Pre-Closing
Receivables after the Closing, including among other things, providing Seller
with reasonable access during normal business hours to any records or other
information transferred to Purchaser in connection with the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement that may be useful in the collection of the
Pre-Closing Receivables. Further, Purchaser acknowledges that after the Closing,
Purchaser may receive payments in respect of Pre-Closing Receivables. In the
event that after the Closing Purchaser receives any payments with respect to the
Pre-Closing Receivables, Purchaser shall promptly upon receipt thereof remit
such payments to Seller. In order to assist the Purchaser in identifying
payments received which are attributable to Pre-Closing Receivables, as soon as
practicable following the Closing, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a
list describing the Pre-Closing Receivables. The Seller shall reimburse the
Purchaser for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser in
complying with the provisions of this Section 5.13(a).

Selling Party in connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
that may be useful in the collection of the Post-Closing Receivables. Further,
the Seller acknowledges that after the Closing, the Selling Parties may receive
payments in respect of Post-Closing Receivables. In the event that after the

incurred by the Seller in complying with the provisions of this Section 5.13(b).

practicable after the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in the event the parties cooperate in good faith
but are nevertheless unable to finalize any Ancillary Agreement by the time
otherwise scheduled for the Closing, the term sheet attached hereto which sets
forth the principal terms of such Ancillary Agreement shall be binding on the
parties and shall govern the relationship of the parties following the Closing
with respect to the matters covered thereby until such time as the parties shall
execute and deliver the applicable Ancillary Agreement.

       5.15 FURTHER ACTION.

               (a) Each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws, and execute and
deliver such documents and other papers, as may be required to carry out the
provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, delivering, or
causing to be delivered, the certificates, opinions and other documents to be
delivered to the other party as a condition to such other party's obligations
under Article VII of this Agreement. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing, at Purchaser's request and without further consideration, the Seller
shall, and shall cause any Selling Party to, at Purchaser's expense, (i) execute
and deliver such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and
confirmation Purchaser may reasonably deem necessary or desirable in order more
effectively to convey to Purchaser, and to confirm Purchaser's title to, all of
the Assets, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control thereof
and to assist Purchaser in exercising all rights with respect thereto and (ii)
prosecute or otherwise enforce in its own name for the benefit of Purchaser any
claims, rights or benefits which are transferred to Purchaser under this
Agreement but which require prosecution or enforcement in the name of any
Selling Party. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if following
the Closing it is determined by the Purchaser and Seller, that Section 3.20 of
the Disclosure Schedule (as supplemented pursuant to Section 5.16) omitted any
machinery, equipment, tools, supplies, furniture, fixtures, personalty, vehicles
or other tangible personal property primarily used in the Business ("Omitted
Tangible Personal Property"), the Seller shall or shall promptly cause the
transfer of such Omitted Tangible Personal Property to the Purchaser upon the
payment by the Purchaser therefor of a purchase price equal to the net asset
book value thereof. Any Omitted Tangible Personal Property shall be deemed to
constitute Tangible Personal Property and Assets for all purposes of this
Agreement.

               (b) CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. The Purchaser acknowledges
that certain Subscriber Business Intellectual Property may not be identified
until after the Closing and therefore will not be physically delivered to the
Purchaser until after the Closing. Following the Closing, the Seller shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to identify any Subscriber Business Intellectual
Property not identified prior to the Closing, and upon the making of such
identification shall promptly thereafter transfer physically all such Subscriber
Business Intellectual Property.

       5.16 SELECTION OF TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY; SPARE PARTS. Subject to the
Seller providing to the Purchaser a reasonably detailed list of Tangible
Personal Property on or prior to January 7, 2000, the Purchaser shall designate
in writing to the Seller on or before January 31, 2000, which items of Tangible
Personal Property the Purchaser desires to purchase pursuant to this Agreement
(the "Selected Tangible Personal Property"); provided however, the Seller shall
in any event provide the Purchaser with such list prior to February 14, 2000. In
the event that the Seller provides such list after January 7, 2000, the
Purchaser shall designate in writing to the Seller the Selected Tangible
Personal Property on the later of (i) February 14, 2000, and (ii) the earlier of
five days after the list is provided to the Purchaser or the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall select sufficient items of Tangible Personal Property such that
the aggregate book value of the Selected Tangible Personal Property, as
reflected in the September Statement of Net Assets,



                                       47
<PAGE>   53







shall equal at least [***] of the aggregate book value of all Tangible Personal
Property, as reflected in the September Statement of Net Assets. Those items of
Tangible Personal Property not so selected shall constitute Excluded Assets.
Subject to the Seller providing to the Purchaser a reasonably detailed list of
spare parts inventory (as to those spare parts not relating to 5GP and PDQ
phones and not otherwise expressly allocated to an outstanding purchase order)
on or prior to January 7, 2000, the Purchaser shall designate in writing to the
Seller on or before January 31, 2000 which items of such spare parts inventory
the Purchaser desires to purchase pursuant to this Agreement; provided however,
the Seller shall in any event provide the Purchaser with such list prior to
February 14, 2000. In the event that the Seller provides such list after January
7, 2000, the Purchaser shall designate in writing to the Seller the items of
such spare parts inventory the Purchaser wishes to purchase on the later of (i)
February 14, 2000, and (ii) the earlier of five days after the list is provided
to the Purchaser or the Closing Date. Those items of spare parts inventory so
selected shall be included in the Assets, and those items of spare parts
inventory not so selected shall constitute Excluded Assets.

       5.17 RELOCATION AND OUTSOURCING. The Seller agrees to discuss in good
faith with the Purchaser the possibility of accomplishing the following prior to
the Closing relocating certain Assets and operations of the Business as between
Real Property to be leased to the Purchaser pursuant to the Lease Agreements. To
the extent the Seller and the Purchaser mutually agree to any such relocation or
outsourcing, the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to accomplish
or significantly prepare for such relocation and outsourcing prior to the
Closing.

for individuals on leave, as of their return from leave as described in the
previous sentence.

       6.3 EMPLOYEE LIABILITIES. The Seller shall retain, and the Purchaser
shall not assume, any obligations relating to (a) any Selected QPE Employees who
do not become employees of the Purchaser, (b) any Selected QPE Employees who
actually become employees of the Purchaser (the "Transferred Employees") arising
on or prior to the Closing Date, or (c) any Seller Selected Employees or any
other employee of Seller. The Seller agrees that the Purchaser shall have no
responsibility to provide continuing group health benefits under the

their "qualified beneficiaries" as defined in COBRA).

of the Business prior to the Closing Date. The Seller shall further indemnify
and hold harmless the Purchaser against any and all claims (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses incurred in defending such claims) against the

expected to be payable by the Purchaser following the Closing that relate to any

made pursuant to Section 2.7 shall result in or serve as the basis for any claim
for indemnification under this Section 8.1.

       8.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE SELLER.

               (a) Following the Closing, the Purchaser and its Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively,
the "Purchaser Indemnitees") shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by
the Seller for any and all Liabilities, losses, damages, diminution in value,
claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
(including, without limitation, attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses)

suffered or incurred by them (including, without limitation, any Action brought
or otherwise initiated by any of them) (hereinafter a "Loss"), arising out of or
resulting from:

                       (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
any Selling Party contained in any Selling Party Document (provided that solely
for purposes of this Article VIII, each such representation and warranty shall
be read as if all qualifications as to materiality, "Material Adverse Effect"
and similar qualifications were deleted therefrom); or

                       (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by any
Selling Party contained in any Selling Party Document; or

                       (iii) Liabilities of any Selling Party, whether arising
before or after the Closing Date, that are not expressly assumed by the
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation: (A)
Liabilities arising from or related to any failure to comply with laws relating
to bulk transfers or bulk sales with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (notwithstanding the waiver contained in Section 5.10); and (B)
the Excluded Liabilities.


       To the extent that the Seller's undertakings set forth in this Section
8.2 may be unenforceable, the Seller shall contribute the maximum amount that it
is permitted to contribute under applicable Law to the payment and satisfaction
of all Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnitees. (b) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement except as provided in
Section 5.18(e), (i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from the Seller arising out of or resulting from the causes
enumerated in Section 8.2(a)(i), or in Section 8.2(a)(ii), shall be an amount
equal to [***] and (ii) the Seller shall not be liable to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnitees for any indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable thereunder
until such time as all such indemnifiable Losses shall aggregate to more [***]
(the "Indemnification Threshold"), after which time the Seller shall be liable
to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees for the entire amount of all Losses. The
limitations on indemnification contained in this Section 8.2(b) shall not apply
to claims for Losses based on fraud or other tortious conduct or the deliberate
failure of the Seller to perform any post-Closing obligations to be performed by
it hereunder.

       8.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER AND THE PARENT CORPORATION.

               (a) Following the Closing, the Seller and its Affiliates,
officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "Seller
Indemnitees") shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by the Purchaser
and the Parent Corporation, jointly and severally, for any and all Losses,
arising out of or resulting from:

                       (i) the breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Purchaser or the Parent Corporation contained in any Purchaser Document
(provided that solely for purposes of this Article VIII, each such
representation and warranty shall be read as if all qualifications as to
materiality and similar qualifications were deleted therefrom); or

                                       55
<PAGE>   61







                       (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement by the
Purchaser or the Parent Corporation contained in any Purchaser Document; or

                       (iii) the Assumed Liabilities.

       To the extent that the undertakings of the Purchaser or the Parent
Corporation set forth in this Section 8.3 may be unenforceable, the Purchaser
and the Parent Corporation shall contribute the maximum amount that it is
permitted to contribute under applicable Law to the payment and satisfaction of
all Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnitees.

               (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from the Purchaser and the Parent Corporation, collectively, arising
out of or resulting from the causes enumerated in Section 8.3(a)(i), or in
Section 8.3(a)(ii) shall be an amount equal to [***] and (ii) neither the
Purchaser nor the Parent Corporation shall be liable to indemnify the Seller
Indemnitees for any indemnifiable Losses otherwise payable thereunder until such
time as all such indemnifiable Losses shall aggregate to more than the
Indemnification Threshold, after which time the Purchaser and the Parent
Corporation, collectively, shall be liable to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees
for the entire amount of all Losses. The limitations on indemnification
contained in this Section 8.3(b) shall not apply to claims for Losses based on
fraud or other tortious conduct or the deliberate failure of the Purchaser or
the Parent Corporation to perform any of its respective post-Closing obligations
to be performed hereunder.

       8.4 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES. An indemnified party shall give the
indemnifying party notice of any matter which an indemnified party has
determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement, within 60 days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss,
if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. The obligations and Liabilities of the indemnifying party
under this Article VIII with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third
party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions: if an indemnified party shall receive notice of
any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party
notice of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of the receipt by the
indemnified party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from any of its obligations
under this Article VIII except to the extent the indemnifying party is
materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the indemnifying
party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to any indemnified
party otherwise under this Article VIII. Upon receipt of notice of a Third Party
Claim, the indemnifying party shall assume and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; provided, however, that if there exists
or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make it
inappropriate in the judgment of the indemnified party for the same counsel to
represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, then the
indemnified party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each
jurisdiction for which the indemnified party determines counsel is required, at
the expense of the indemnifying party; provided, further, that the indemnified
party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, at the expense of the
indemnifying party, if

                                       56
<PAGE>   62







the indemnifying party fails to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim within
15 days of receipt of a notice relating thereto. In the event the indemnifying
party undertakes any such defense against any such Third Party Claim as provided
above, the indemnified party shall cooperate with the indemnifying party in such
defense and make available to the indemnifying party, at the indemnifying
party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in
the indemnified party's possession or under the indemnified party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the indemnifying party. Similarly,
in the event the indemnified party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the
defense against any such Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall
cooperate with the indemnified party in such defense and make available to the
indemnified party, at the indemnifying party's expense, all such witnesses,
records, materials and information in the indemnifying party's possession or
under the indemnifying party's control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the indemnified party. No such Third Party Claim may be settled by
the indemnifying party without the written consent of the indemnified party,
unless such settlement only requires payment of money damages which will be
indemnified.

       8.5 TAX MATTERS. Anything in this Article VIII (except for the specific
reference to Tax matters in Section 8.1) to the contrary notwithstanding, the
rights and obligations of the parties with respect to indemnification for any
and all Tax matters shall be governed by Section 5.11.

       8.6 KNOWLEDGE OF BREACH. For purposes of this Article 8, (a) Seller shall
not be deemed to have breached any representation, warranty or covenant if
Purchaser or Parent Corporation had actual knowledge (as determined in
accordance with Section 10.15 and with respect to which the Seller shall bear
the burden of proving), on or prior to the Closing Date, of the breach of, or of
any facts or circumstances constituting or resulting in a breach of, such
representation, warranty or covenant, and (b) neither Purchaser nor Parent
Corporation shall be deemed to have breached any representation, warranty or
covenant if Seller had actual knowledge (as determined in accordance with
Section 10.15 and with respect to which the Purchaser shall bear the burden of
proving), on or prior to the Closing Date, of the breach of, or of any facts or
circumstances constituting or resulting in a breach of, such representation,
warranty or covenant.

       8.7 INDEMNIFICATION EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Except as provided for in Sections
2.7 and 5.18(e) and except for claims based on fraud or other tortious conduct
or a party's deliberate failure to perform post-Closing covenants to be
performed by it, the right of each party hereto to demand and receive
indemnification payments pursuant to this Article 8 shall be the sole and
exclusive right and remedy exercisable by such party with respect to any breach
of any representation or warranty of the other party contained in this Agreement
or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto or noncompliance by the other
party with any covenant contained in this Agreement.

       8.8 SUBROGATION. To the extent that either party hereto (the
"Indemnitor") makes or is required to make any indemnification payment to the
other party hereto (the "Indemnified Party"), the Indemnitor shall be entitled
to exercise, and shall be subrogated to, any rights and remedies (including
rights of indemnity, rights of contribution and other rights of recovery) that
the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Party's Affiliates may have
against any other



                                       57
<PAGE>   63







Person with respect to any Losses, circumstances or Action to which such
indemnification payment is directly or indirectly related. The Indemnified Party
shall permit the Indemnitor to use the name of the Indemnified Party and the
names of the Indemnified Party's Affiliates in any transaction or in any
proceeding or other Action involving any of such rights or remedies; and the
Indemnified Party shall take such actions as the Indemnitor may reasonably
request for the purpose of enabling the Indemnitor to perfect or exercise the
Indemnitor's right of subrogation hereunder.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                             TERMINATION AND WAIVER

       9.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:

               (a) by the Purchaser if, between the date hereof and the time
scheduled for the Closing: (i) an event or condition occurs that has resulted in
or that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; or
(ii) the Seller makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any
proceeding shall be instituted by or against the Seller seeking to adjudicate it
a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up or reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of its debts under
any Law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; or

               (b) by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall
not have occurred by 12:01 a.m. on March 27, 2000 , which date may be extended
by mutual written consent of the parties hereto; provided, however, that if a
request for additional information is received from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant
to the HSR Act, such date shall be extended to the fourteenth (14th) calendar
day following acknowledgment by the FTC or DOJ, as applicable, that the parties
have complied with such request, but in any event not later than 12:01 a.m. on
June 30, 2000; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.1(b) shall not be available to any party whose failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or
shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or prior to such
date; or

               (c) by either the Purchaser or the Seller in the event that any
Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and nonappealable; or

               (d) by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the
Purchaser.

       9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement
as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there
shall be no liability on the part of either party hereto except (a) as set forth
in Section 5.3 and Article X and (b) that nothing herein shall relieve either
party from liability for any breach of this Agreement.

       9.3 WAIVER. The Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser and the Parent
Corporation, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the



                                       58
<PAGE>   64







obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any document
delivered by the other pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other contained herein. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the party to be bound thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be
construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the
same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this
Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall
not constitute a waiver of any of such rights.

                                   ARTICLE 10

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

timely performance and satisfaction of each of said covenants, obligations and

against Purchaser or any other person.

       10.15 KNOWLEDGE. As used in this Agreement, the "knowledge" of a Party,
means (a) with respect to Seller, the actual knowledge of the Chief Executive

PURCHASE AGREEMENT"; unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall be
used herein as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement); and

        WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Bill of Sale and Assignment
by the Seller is a condition to the obligations of the Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement.

        NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration to the Seller, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, and pursuant to the
Asset Purchase Agreement, the Seller, intending to be legally bound hereby, does
hereby agree as follows:

        1. SALE AND ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND PROPERTIES.

               (a) The Seller does hereby sell, assign, transfer, convey, grant,

Purchaser may deem proper in order to collect, assert or enforce any claim,
right or title of any kind in or to the Assets hereby sold and assigned to the

remedy of any nature whatsoever, under or by reason of this Bill of Sale and

                                    EXHIBIT E

                  PRINCIPAL TERMS OF EMPLOYEE MATTERS AGREEMENT



1. Seller shall create a separate wholly owned subsidiary ("QCP"), which will
continue to employ those identified employees of the Business that are necessary
to the provision of certain enumerated services to Purchaser, including
engineering, product management, quality, sales and marketing, as well as
administrative and other services (e.g. information technology, human resources,
finance and operations) to be agreed by the parties (the "Selected Business
Employees"). Purchaser shall specifically identify such employees that Purchaser
desires to include in the group of Selected Business Employees on or before
January 17, 2000. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser with
respect to any and all claims brought by employees of the Business that are not
selected by Purchaser to be included in the group of Selected Business Employees
to the extent such claims against Purchaser relate in any way to stock options
in Seller held by employees not selected.

2. [ *** ] Notwithstanding the foregoing, except for normal and customary
increases consistent with past practices, QCP shall not increase (as a result of
increasing the level of benefits, salaries and the like, or the manner of
calculating the overhead allocation) any such costs or other expenses to be
charged to Purchaser without the prior written approval of Purchaser, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. QCP shall not be entitled to charge
Purchaser for any such non-approved increased costs or expenses. In no event
shall Purchaser have any obligation to pay to QCP for any such costs to the
extent that they relate in any way to stock options held by any Selected
Business Employee.

3. The Selected Business Employees shall perform such services as are reasonably
specified by Purchaser from time to time. Except for those services specifically
agreed to by the parties to be provided to Seller pursuant to the Retained
Business Support Agreement, [ *** ], the Selected Business Employees shall,

unless otherwise mutually agreed, perform services exclusively for Purchaser
primarily for the purpose of design and development of CDMA handsets which
incorporate Seller ASICs, to be manufactured by Purchaser, with sales and
marketing and administrative support provided by QCP. The parties agree that in
the event of any competing demands for services of the Selected Business
Employees which may arise under the Retained Business Support Agreement or
otherwise, the first priority of the Selected Business Employees in performing
services shall be to perform those services to be performed for the benefit of
Purchaser.

                                       1
<PAGE>   79

4. The statutory officers of QCP shall be selected by Seller. All statutory
officers of QCP shall consist of Seller officers and/or employees that are not
within the group of Selected Business Employees.

5. The Board of Directors of QCP will consist of one board member. The board
member shall be selected by Seller and will be an individual that is not within
the group of Selected Business Employees.

6. QCP shall retain control of the employment relationship with the Selected
Business Employees throughout the [ *** ] period, including the right to adjust
pay, discipline, supervise, terminate, hire, promote, etc. QCP shall have the
exclusive right, in its sole discretion, to grant stock options, if any, to the
Selected Business Employees.

7. During the [ *** ] term, unless otherwise mutually agreed, Seller will not
transfer any Selected Business Employee to Seller.

8. During the [ *** ] term, QCP will be responsible for ensuring compliance with
applicable employment laws, including those related to payroll and compensation,
benefits, withholding of state and federal taxes, workers compensation
insurance, disability insurance, workplace safety, state and federal law
relating to the employment relationship, as well as applicable record-keeping
requirements. Any penalties or additional payments required as a result of QCP's
failure to pay wages, taxes, insurance or other amounts required by law shall be
borne by QCP.

9. Purchaser and QCP shall agree upon appropriate terms and conditions relating
to confidentiality of information of Purchaser and QCP, and to ownership of
intellectual property created or conceived by the Selected Business Employees
during the [ *** ] term. Generally, any intellectual property created or
conceived by any Selected Business Employee (except for intellectual property
created or conceived in connection with performing those services specifically
agreed to by the parties to be provided to Seller pursuant to the Retained
Business Support Agreement) during the [ *** ] term shall be the property of
Purchaser; provided, however, if any such intellectual property is derivative of
any intellectual property owned by or licensed to Seller (or its affiliates) and
in existence prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not have any rights in
such underlying intellectual property except as expressly granted to Purchaser
elsewhere.

10. After the [ *** ] term, Purchaser shall identify those Selected Business
Employees that Purchaser desires (excluding the statutory officers and the
director of QCP) to hire as full-time employees of Purchaser and may make offers
of employment to such employees. Any Selected Business Employee that is not
hired or that declines to be hired by Purchaser may be transferred by Seller to
Seller (or any affiliate of Seller). Purchaser shall pay all costs and expenses
associated with any Selected Business Employee that is not offered employment by
Purchaser as set forth above and is terminated by QCP upon the expiration of the
[ *** ] term and not otherwise employed by Purchaser and/or Seller; provided,
however, Purchaser shall have no liability for any such costs or expenses to the
extent that they relate in any way to stock options in Seller held by any such
Selected Business Employee, and Seller shall

                                       2
<PAGE>   80

indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser with respect to any and all claims brought
by Selected Business Employees after the [ *** ] term to the extent such claims
against Purchaser relate in any way to stock options in Seller held by any such
Selected Business Employee.

11. If during the [ *** ] term Purchaser elects to reduce the number of Selected
Business Employees, then Seller (and any of its affiliates) shall be entitled to
transfer any such Selected Business Employees which Purchaser desires to exclude
from the list of Selected Business Employees. Purchaser shall (i) pay all costs
and expenses associated with any such Selected Business Employees not so
transferred by Seller to Seller (or its affiliates) who are terminated by QCP
prior to the expiration of the [ *** ] term and not otherwise employed by Seller
(or its affiliates), and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
officers, directors, employees and affiliates with respect to any and all claims
arising out of or relating to any such early termination by QCP of any such
Selected Business Employees; provided, however, Purchaser shall have no
liability for any such costs or expenses and Purchaser shall have no obligation
to provide such indemnification to the extent that they relate in any way to
stock options in Seller held by any such Selected Business Employee, and Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser with respect to any and all claims
brought by Selected Business Employees to the extent such claims against
Purchaser relate in any way to stock options in Seller held by any such Selected
Business Employee.

12. The parties shall mutually agree to the manner in which Selected Business
Employees shall be permitted to represent themselves with respect to third
parties (for example, with respect to the use of business cards, stationary and
the like); provided, however, in no case shall the Selected Business Employees
be permitted to represent themselves in a manner which is inconsistent with
being anything other than QCP employees; provided further, however, that that
shall not preclude the Selected Business Employees from representing that, in
their capacity as employees of QCP, they are performing services for Purchaser.

13. Services performed by the Selected Business Employees shall be provided on
an "AS-IS" basis. QCP makes no warranty concerning such services.

14. With respect to any actions (or inaction) of the Selected Business Employees
which are done as a result of the requirements or other requests of Purchaser,
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, QCP and Seller's officers,
directors, employees and affiliates with respect to any and all claims arising
out of or relating to any such actions (or inaction). Without limitation to the
prior sentence, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, QCP and
Seller's officers, directors, employees and affiliates with respect to any and
all claims for infringement arising out of or relating to engineering services
provided to Purchaser by QCP and the Selected Business Employees. With respect
to any actions (or inaction) of the Selected Business Employees which are done
as a result of the requirements or other requests of QCP (other than as a result
of the requirements or other requests of Purchaser), QCP shall indemnify and
hold harmless Purchaser and Purchaser's officers, directors, employees and
affiliates with respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to any
such actions (or inaction).

                             in continuing the Business:

                             [ *** ]

                             All of the facilities will be delivered to
                             Purchaser on a then current "as is" basis, without
                             warranty by Seller; provided, however, the
                             Purchaser shall have the right to inspect the
                             facilities prior to the Closing and prepare a list
                             of items requiring repair in order to put such
                             properties in the condition required by the terms

                             Seller shall reasonably promptly fix, at Seller's
                             cost and expense, those items required to be so
                             repaired. Any future alterations will require the

                             With respect to all other facilities, the term of
                             the subject lease or sublease shall expire
                             concurrently with the expiration of the existing
                             term under the applicable Master Lease. Seller
                             shall not be required to exercise any option to
                             extend the term under any Master Lease. The lease
                             or sublease arrangements shall commence on
                             consummation of the sale of the Business; provided,
                             however, that in the event the sale transaction
                             does not close, Seller and Purchaser shall be under
                             no obligation to lease the facilities, obtain
                             assignments of leases or enter into subleases. Each
                             form of lease or sublease shall be prepared by
                             Seller and shall contain such other terms and
                             conditions as are commonly found in leases
                             currently being used by landlords for similar space
                             in the vicinity of the subject properties.

NON-OWNED FACILITIES:        As to each facility [ *** ] Seller, at its
                             election, shall either assign the lease for such

                             to Purchaser. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge that
                             each proposed assignment and sublease will be
                             subject to obtaining the consent of the landlord
                             under the applicable Master Lease, and will be
                             further subject to the restrictions on
                             assignment/subletting contained in the applicable
                             Master Lease.

                             Each sublease shall provide that the subtenant will
                             perform all of the obligations of the tenant under
                             the Master Lease as well as such other obligations
                             as are set forth in the form of sublease to be
                             prepared by Seller and approved by Purchaser.
                             Seller will use reasonable good faith efforts, at
                             no cost or liability to Seller, to cause the
                             landlord under each Master Lease to perform its
                             obligations under the Master Lease for the benefit
                             of Purchaser.

           PRINCIPAL TERMS OF THE RETAINED BUSINESS SUPPORT AGREEMENT


TERM:                 Purchaser shall provide Seller with prescribed Services
                      (as defined below) and access to equipment and facilities
                      (as described below) for a period of between six (6) and
                      twelve (12) months (depending on the nature of the
                      Service, equipment and/or facilities, which time frame for
                      any given type of Service, equipment and/or facility shall
                      be specified in greater detail in the definitive Retained
                      Business Support Agreement or attached statements of
                      work), or for that longer period of time as is mutually
                      agreed to by the parties or that shorter period of time as
                      is directed by Seller for any particular Service,
                      equipment or facility (the "Term"). The provision of
                      Services and the access to equipment and facilities shall
                      be on mutually agreed upon terms and conditions, taking
                      into account the availability of the subject equipment and
                      facilities, as well as the work load of potentially
                      affected personnel. The parties shall cooperate in good
                      faith to define reasonable parameters for the provision of
                      Services and the access to any subject equipment and
                      facilities. Seller acknowledges and agrees that, in the
                      event of any conflict between the needs of Purchaser and
                      the needs of Seller with respect to the utilization of
                      affected personnel, equipment or facilities, the needs of
                      Purchaser shall have priority.

SERVICES:             The type and scope of such Services which Purchaser shall
                      make available to Seller shall consist of those services
                      which are currently provided in the Business (except to
                      the extent providing such Services compromises or could
                      reasonably be expected to compromise Purchaser's
                      confidential information, as reasonably determined by
                      Purchaser) and which support other current business
                      activities of Seller (such as the Condor business and
                      other government and high security business and
                      applications, the ASICs business, the Globalstar business
                      and other satellite based business and applications such
                      as global positioning, the OmniTracs business and other
                      tracking or monitoring type businesses and applications,
                      HDR, Eudora, net broadcast applications, and the wireless
                      network test and deployment tools and software
                      businesses), including the following services and
                      technical support (collectively, the "Services"):

                      Manufacturing: Purchaser may provide services relating to
                      the manufacture and assembly of subscriber equipment.



                                       1
<PAGE>   88

                      Engineering Services: Purchaser may provide engineering
                      and technical services, including test.

                      Assistance with Litigation Matters: Purchaser may provide
                      Seller with reasonable access to personnel and records
                      with respect to any pending or threatened litigation
                      matters to the extent such personnel and/or records are
                      knowledgeable about/relevant to such matters.

EQUIPMENT/
  FACILITIES:         The type and scope of access to equipment and facilities
                      which Purchaser shall make available to Seller shall
                      consist of the use of that equipment and those facilities
                      that are used in the Business and which support other
                      current business activities of Seller, including equipment
                      and facilities used for test and development purposes
                      (except to the extent providing access to such equipment
                      or facilities compromises or could reasonably be expected
                      to compromise Purchaser's confidential information, as
                      reasonably determined by Purchaser).

DESIGNATION:          As soon as reasonably practical and in any event prior to
                      the Closing Date, Seller shall designate to Purchaser the
                      specific type and scope of the Services requested by
                      Seller, as well as identified the equipment and facilities
                      as to which Seller desires access; provided, however,
                      Seller acknowledges and agrees that the ability of
                      Purchaser to provide any requested Service and access as
                      of the Closing Date and thereafter, and the initial
                      quality of such Service, may be negatively impacted to the
                      extent Seller makes its designations at a time(s) closer
                      to the Closing Date than at an earlier time(s).

PERFORMANCE OF
SERVICES/ACCESS:      Purchaser shall provide the Services and permit such
                      access to equipment and facilities on an ongoing basis
                      during the Term in accordance with mutually agreed upon
                      reasonable parameters, taking into account availability of
                      the subject equipment and facilities, as well as the work
                      load of potentially affected personnel.

QCP EMPLOYEES:        It is acknowledged that Services to be provided under the
                      Retained Business Support Agreement may be performed by
                      employees transferred to QCP and who otherwise are to
                      exclusively provide their services to Purchaser in support
                      of the Business. The use of any such employees shall

                      services which Seller currently provides in support of the

                      Seller's confidential information, as reasonably
                      determined by Seller), including the following services

                      MIS Services: Seller may provide management information
                      services to Purchaser related to the Business, including

                      analytical support services, each as related to the

                      Engineering Services: Seller may provide engineering and

                      As soon as reasonably practical and in any event prior to
                      the Closing Date, Purchaser shall designate to Seller the
                      specific type and scope of the Services requested by
                      Purchaser; provided, however, Purchaser acknowledges and
                      agrees that the ability of Seller to provide any requested
                      Service as of the Closing Date and thereafter, and the
                      initial quality of such Service, may be negatively
                      impacted to the extent Purchaser makes its designations at
                      a time(s) closer to the Closing Date than at an earlier
                      time(s).

                                   EXHIBIT J

         FORM OF OPINION OF PURCHASER'S AND PARENT CORPORATION'S COUNSEL


        Please note that, as a firm, we are not able to opine on the
enforceability of noncompete, nonsolicit or licensing provisions. In addition,
the opinion shall contain customary assumptions and exceptions. The following
opinions are subject to approval by our opinion committee.

        1. Each of the Purchaser and the Parent Corporation is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation and has all necessary corporate power and
authority to own, operate or lease the properties and assets now owned, operated
or leased by it and to carry on its business as it has been and is currently
conducted. Each of the Purchaser and the Parent Corporation has all necessary
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver the Asset Purchase
Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is a party, to perform its
obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
The execution and delivery by each of the Purchaser and the Parent Corporation
of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is a
party, the performance by it of its obligations thereunder and the consummation
by it of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action on its part. The Asset Purchase Agreement and the
Related Agreements to which each of the Purchaser and the Parent Corporation is
a party have been duly executed and delivered by it, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Seller) the Asset Purchase
Agreement and the Related Agreements to which each of the Purchaser and the
Parent Corporation is a party constitute its legal, valid and binding
obligations, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms,
except as rights to indemnity under Article VIII of the Asset Purchase Agreement
and rights to indemnity and contribution under any of the Related Agreements may
be limited by applicable laws and except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws
relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or
similar law affecting creditors' rights and subject to general equity principles
and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including specific
performance.

        2. Assuming that all approvals required under the HSR Act have been made
or obtained, the execution, delivery and performance by each of the Purchaser
and the Parent Corporation of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which it is a party do not and will not, to the best of our
knowledge, conflict with or violate (or cause an event which could have a
Material Adverse Effect as a result of) any law or governmental order of the
State of California or the United States of America applicable to the Purchaser
or the Parent Corporation or any of their respective assets, properties or
businesses (except that we express no opinion as to any law or governmental
order related to any telecommunications regulatory matter).

        3. The execution, delivery and performance by each of the Purchaser and
the Parent Corporation of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which it is a party, do not and will not require any consent,
approval, authorization or other order of, action by, filing with or
notification to, any Governmental Authority of the State of California or the
United



                                       1.

States of America, except the notification requirements of the HSR Act (except
that we express no opinion as to any law or governmental order related to any
telecommunications regulatory matter).

        4. The execution, delivery and performance of the Asset Purchase
Agreement and the Related Agreements to which each of the Purchaser and the
Parent Corporation is a party do not and will not violate any provision of its
Certificate of Incorporation or Articles of Incorporation or bylaws.

        5. To the best of our knowledge, as of the date of the Asset Purchase
Agreement, there was no Action pending or threatened in writing, which seeks to
delay or prevent the consummation of, or which would be reasonably likely to
materially adversely affect the Purchaser's or the Parent Corporation's ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement or
any Related Agreement, pending before any Governmental Authority of the State of
California or the United States of America.

                                    EXHIBIT K

                       FORM OF OPINION OF SELLER'S COUNSEL

Please note that, as a firm, we are not able to opine on the enforceability of
noncompete, nonsolicit or licensing provisions. In addition, the opinion shall
contain customary assumptions and exceptions. The following opinions are subject
to approval by our opinion committee.

        1. The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has all necessary
corporate power and authority to own, operate or lease the properties and assets
now owned, operated or leased by it and to carry on the Business as it has been
and is currently conducted. The Company has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which it is a party, to perform its obligations thereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery by
the Company of the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related Agreements to which
it is a party, the performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder and
the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated thereby have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of the
Company. The Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is
a party have been duly executed and delivered by the Company, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchaser and the Parent
Corporation) the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related Agreements to which
the Company is a party constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their respective
terms, except as rights to indemnity under Article VIII of the Asset Purchase
Agreement and rights to indemnity and contribution under any of the Related
Agreements may be limited by applicable laws and except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all
laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization, arrangement, moratorium
or similar law affecting creditors' rights and subject to general equity
principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief, including
specific performance.

        2. Assuming that all approvals required under the HSR Act, and that all
consents, approvals, authorizations, other actions, filings and notifications
listed in Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule, have been made
or obtained, the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Asset
Purchase Agreement and the Related Agreements to which the Company is a party do
not and will not, to the best of our knowledge, conflict with or violate (or
cause an event which could have a Material Adverse Effect as a result of) any
law or governmental order of the State of California or the United States of
America applicable to the Company or any of its assets, properties or
businesses, including, without limitation, the Assets and the Business (except
that we express no opinion as to any law or governmental order related to any
telecommunications regulatory matter).

        3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Asset
Purchase Agreement and the Related Agreements to which the Company is a party,
do not and will not require any consent, approval, authorization or other order
of, action by, filing with or notification to, any Governmental Authority of the
State of California or the United States of America, except (i) as described in
Sections 3.2, 3.3 and 3.15 of the Disclosure Schedule and (ii)



                                       1.
<PAGE>   97

the notification requirements of the HSR Act (except that we express no opinion
as to any law or governmental order related to any telecommunications regulatory
matter).

        4. The execution, delivery and performance of the Asset Purchase
Agreement and the Related Agreements to which the Company is a party do not and
will not violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company.

        5. Except as disclosed in Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Schedule, to
the best of our knowledge, as of the date of the Asset Purchase Agreement, there
were no Actions by or against the Company relating to the Business, or affecting
or that could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect any of
the Assets or the Business, pending before any Governmental Authority of the
State of California or the United States of America (or, to the best of our
knowledge, threatened in writing to be brought by or before any Governmental
Authority of the State of California or the United States of America). To the
best of our knowledge, none of the matters disclosed in Section 3.12 of the
Disclosure Schedule could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of the material terms of
the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Related Agreements or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby.

                                  INTRODUCTION

        WHEREAS, QUALCOMM INCORPORATED (the "Company") has established a
supplementary employee retirement plan as set forth herein (the "Plan") to
provide deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly
compensated employees of the Employer, originally effective December 1, 1995;
and

        WHEREAS, the Company amended and restated the Plan on August 26, 1996,
to refine the definition of "Base Salary;" on December 18, 1997, to limit the
instances in which termination of employment following a Change of Control will
fully vest the benefits provided to participants in the Plan, on January 19,
1998, to provide for the discretionary allocation of contributions by the Board,
to the accounts of Participants, on April 24, 1998, to adjust the formula for
Matching Contributions in order to improve the benefits provided to Participants
in the Plan and to add additional vesting schedules to allow certain
participants to accelerate the vesting in their participant Accounts, on August
1, 1998, to allow the transfer of funds under limited circumstances to or from
certain other nonqualified, unfunded, deferred compensation plans and to
determine when a termination of employment has occurred, and effective February
20, 1999 to permit employment with the Company's Affiliate, Wireless Knowledge,
Inc. to be considered for purposes of certain types of vesting under the Plan;
and

        WHEREAS, the Company has the legal authority to establish the Plan
pursuant to the laws of the State of Delaware and to amend the Plan pursuant to
Section 10.1 of the Plan; and

        WHEREAS, the Company intends to provide under the Plan that the Company
shall pay to Participants and their beneficiaries the entire cost of benefits
under the Plan from its general assets and set aside contributions by the
Company to meet its obligations under the Plan; and

        WHEREAS, the Company intends that the assets of the Plan and its
accompanying trust shall at all times be subject to the claims of the general
creditors of the Company in the event of the financial insolvency of the
Company; and

        WHEREAS, the Company intends that any rights of Participants in the Plan
and their beneficiaries be unsecured and unfunded for purposes of tax law and
for purposes of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA"); and

        WHEREAS, the Company wishes to amend the Plan to add an additional
alternate vesting schedule;

        NOW, THEREFORE, the Company does hereby amend and restate the Plan as
follows, effective as of January 1, 2000, and does also hereby agree that the
assets of the Plan shall be identified, held, invested, and disposed of as
follows:

                                   DEFINITIONS

Participant who are to receive any distributions from the Plan payable upon the
death of the Participant.

the Employer is required to furnish the Participant a written statement under
Section 6041(d) or Section 6051(a)(3) of the Code, excluding the following
items: any bonus other than an annual cash incentive bonus which is normally
paid by the Employer to a Participant in the month of December, commissions, the
value of a qualified, incentive, or non-qualified stock option granted to the

benefits (cash and non-cash), moving expenses, deferred compensation and welfare
benefits, and in-service withdrawals of amounts from the Plan or the Executive
Retirement Plan, but including amounts that are not includable in the gross

reason of an election of the Participant to defer amounts of base salary under
the Executive Retirement Plan. Base Salary must be determined without regard to

otherwise, (iii) a transaction in which beneficial ownership of at least thirty
percent (30%) of the shares of the Company's common stock is no longer held by
those shareholders (or their affiliates) holding such beneficial ownership
immediately prior to such transaction, (iv) the sale of all or substantially all
of the Company's assets, or (v) the acquisition

                                  CONTRIBUTIONS

        3.1 All non-discretionary contributions ("Match Contributions") to the
Plan with respect to a given Participant shall be made by the Company in the
amount determined under the following formula.

        The Company will make a Match Contribution to the Plan with respect to a
Participant for a Plan Year in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the
amount which such Participant has authorized to be withheld from his or her
compensation (as defined in the Executive Retirement Plan) which would have
otherwise been paid during such Plan Year and which is contributed to the
Executive Retirement Plan on his or her behalf.

        For Plan Years prior to Plan Year 1998, the Match Contribution to the
Plan with respect to a Participant for a given Plan Year shall not exceed 7.5%
(or 50% of 15%) of such Participant's Base Salary for the fiscal year of the
QUALCOMM Inc. Employee Savings and Profit Sharing Plan (the "401(k) Plan") which
ends with or within the Plan Year, reduced by the lesser of 50% of the limit
established under section 402(g) of the Code for the calendar year which ends
with or within such Plan Year (i.e., 50% of $9,240 for calendar year 1995) or
50% of the maximum amount which the Plan permits a Participant to contribute to
the 401(k) Plan for the fiscal year of the 401(k) Plan which ends with or within
such Plan Year (the "401(k) Annual Matching Contribution Limit").

        For Plan Year 1998, the Match Contribution to the Plan with respect to a
Participant shall not exceed the sum of 7.5% (or 50% of 15%) of the wages
portion of such Participant's Base Salary (excluding all items of compensation
listed as being excluded from the definition of Base Salary and also excluding
the annual cash incentive bonus that is normally paid by the Employer to the
Participant in the month of December) and 10% (or 50% of 20%) of the portion of
such Participant's Base Salary that is attributable to the annual cash incentive
bonus that is normally paid by the Employer to the Participant in the month of
December for the fiscal year of the 401(k) Plan which ends with or within the
Plan Year, reduced by the lesser of 50% of the limit established under section
402(g) of the Code for the calendar year which ends with or within such Plan
Year (i.e., 50% of $10,000 for calendar year 1998) or 50% of the 401(k) Annual
Matching Contribution Limit.

        For Plan Years commencing after Plan Year 1998, the Match Contribution
to the Plan with respect to a Participant for a given Plan Year shall not exceed
10% (or 50% of 20%) of such Participant's Base Salary for the fiscal year of the
401(k) Plan which ends with or within the Plan Year, reduced by the lesser of
50% of the limit established under section 402(g) of the Code for the calendar
year which ends with or within such Plan Year or 50% of the 401(k) Annual
Matching Contribution Limit.

        The Company's Match Contribution to the Plan for a given Participant for
a specified quarterly contribution period as described in Section 3.4 shall be
equal to fifty percent (50%) of the amount which the Participant has authorized
to be withheld from his or her compensation (as defined in the Executive
Retirement Plan) for contribution to the Executive Retirement Plan



                                       5.
<PAGE>   8

which would have otherwise been paid during such quarterly contribution period,
subject to a maximum of 2.5% (1.875% for Plan Years prior to Plan Year 1998) of
such Participant's Base Salary for the fiscal year of the 401(k) Plan ending
with or within the Plan Year with respect to which such quarterly contribution
is made, and further reduced by 25% of the 401(k) Annual Matching Contribution
Limit for the fiscal year of the 401(k) Plan ending with or within the Plan Year
in which such quarterly contribution period falls. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company's Match Contribution to the Plan for a given Participant
for the final quarterly contribution period for a given Plan Year shall be equal
to the annual Match Contribution for such Participant for that Plan Year
calculated by applying the rules set forth in the preceding paragraph, reduced
by the sum of the Match Contributions made by the Company for the first three
quarterly contribution periods of that Plan Year. Furthermore, notwithstanding
any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Company's Match
Contribution for a given Participant for a specified quarterly contribution
period shall be rounded up to the next whole number of shares of the Company's
common stock. No Participant shall be permitted to make or authorize any
contributions to the Plan, whether by means of authorized withholding and
deferral of compensation or otherwise.

        No entity which is a part of the Employer other than the Company shall
have any obligations to make any contributions to the Plan, pay any benefits to
any Participant created by the Plan, or have any other financial obligation or
liability as a result of the establishment, operation or termination of the
Plan.

        3.2 From time to time the Company may, as recommended by the
Compensation Committee to the Board, and approved by the Board in its complete
discretion, make a discretionary contribution of less than twenty-five thousand
(25,000) shares to a Participant's Account, for one or more Participants, to
recruit or retain Participants as employees of the Company.

        3.3 All contributions to the Plan shall be made solely in the form of
whole shares of the Company's common stock. For purposes of converting the
Company's contribution from a dollar value as determined under Section 3.1 to a
number of whole shares of the Company's common stock which shall be contributed
for a quarterly contribution period as described in Section 3.4, the Fair Market
Value of the Company's common stock shall be the average of the closing sales
prices for the Company's common stock for a period of the last ten (10) trading
days within such quarterly contribution period.

        3.4 Match Contributions shall be made to the Plan by the Company for a
given Plan Year on a quarterly basis. The first quarterly Match Contribution
shall be made as soon as administratively reasonable after March 31 and shall
relate to contributions on compensation received or otherwise receivable by
Participants on or after January 1 and on or before the next following March 31.
The second quarterly Match Contribution shall be made as soon as
administratively reasonable after June 30 and shall relate to contributions on
compensation received or otherwise receivable by Participants after March 31 and
on or before the following June 30. The third quarterly Match Contribution shall
be made as soon as administratively reasonable after September 30 and shall
relate to contributions on compensation received or otherwise receivable by
Participants after June 30 and on or before the following September 30.



                                       6.
<PAGE>   9

The fourth quarterly Match Contribution shall be made as soon as
administratively reasonable after December 31 and shall relate to contributions
on compensation received or otherwise receivable by Participants after September
30 and on or before the last day of such Plan Year. However, the Match
Contribution for the Plan's initial Plan Year shall be made as soon as
administratively reasonable after December 31, 1995 and shall relate to
contributions on compensation received or otherwise receivable by Participants
during the month of December 1995.

        Discretionary contributions made pursuant to Section 3.2 may be made at
any time.

        3.5 All contributions to the Plan made by the Company shall be held as
an asset of the Company, and the Company shall deposit such contributions (less
any applicable tax withholding required by law) into the Trust.

        3.6 The Company, through the Plan Administrator, has the power to
establish rules and from time to time to modify or change such rules governing
the manner and method by which contributions are made, but only the Compensation
Committee may change the contribution formula set forth in Section 3.1 of the
Plan.

        3.7 All deposits to the Trust made under the Plan on behalf of a
Participant shall be reflected by a credit in the same amount to such
Participant's Account. A Participant's Account is a bookkeeping record of all
amounts deposited in the Trust on behalf of such Participant, and any earnings
allocated to such Account as provided in the Plan, for purposes of determining
the Participant's interest in the Trust, and shall be accounted for and reported
in terms of whole shares of the Company's common stock.

        3.8 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the
maximum number of shares which may be contributed to the Plan shall be eight
hundred thousand (800,000) shares of the Company's common stock (after giving
effect to the 2:1 split in the Company's common stock effective May 10, 1999,
and the 4:1 split in the Company's common stock effective December 30, 1999).

                          WITHDRAWALS DURING EMPLOYMENT

        4.1 A Participant may request a withdrawal of some or all of his or her
benefits from the Plan while remaining employed by the Employer, but whether or
not such a request is approved shall be in the sole discretion of the Plan
Administrator.

                                    ARTICLE 5
             EARNINGS ON PARTICIPANTS' ACCOUNTS AND PLAN INVESTMENTS

        5.1 All contributions will be made in shares of the Company's common
stock. In the event that the Trust for any reason holds cash or other property
sufficient to purchase a whole share of the Company's common stock, the Trustee
shall arrange to acquire additional shares of the Company's common stock, either
by purchasing such shares in the public market or by



                                       7.
<PAGE>   10

acquiring such shares directly from the Company. In the event that the Trust for
any reason holds cash or other property in an amount insufficient to purchase a
whole share of the Company's common stock, such amount shall be held in cash or
a cash equivalent determined by the Plan Administrator.

        5.2 All contributions and other amounts governed by the terms of the
Plan and Trust Agreement, including all investments purchased with such amounts
and all income attributable thereto, shall remain (until distributed to a
Participant or Beneficiary) the property of the Company as provided under the
Plan and Trust Agreement and shall be subject to the claims of the Company's
general creditors in the event of the Company's financial insolvency. No
Participant or Beneficiary shall have any secured or beneficial interest in any
property, rights or investments held by the Company, the Employer or the Trustee
in connection with the Plan.

        5.3 Each Participant's Account shall be invested in shares of the
Company's common stock and shall be accounted for and reported in terms of whole
shares of the Company's common stock.

        5.4 Earnings shall be calculated and allocated as of the last day of
each Plan Year and such other dates as shall be determined by the Plan
Administrator in the Plan Administrator's sole discretion.

        5.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, and
intending to elaborate on the other provisions of this Article 5, any
transaction which might cause the Trust to hold any property other than a single
class of the Company's securities (such as cash) as a result of any transaction
(such as the payment of a cash dividend), and after the completion of such
transaction that other property does not comprise a majority of the Plan's
assets (by value) held by the Trust, then such property shall be allocated to
Participants' Accounts on a provisional basis, the Trustee shall use such
property to acquire additional shares of the same class of the Company's
security held by the Trust, and each Participant's Account shall then be rounded
to the nearest whole number of shares of such security. Any remaining property
other than the Company's securities shall be held unallocated in the Trust. If
after completing these actions the number of shares of the Company's securities
held by the Trust is less than the sum of the shares allocated to the
Participants' Accounts, then the Company shall contribute sufficient additional
shares to the Trust to make up the difference. If the sum of the number of
shares allocated to the Participants' Accounts is less than the number of shares
of the Company's securities held by the Trust, then all Participants whose
Account balances were rounded down shall be ranked in order based on the size of
the fractional share allocated to their Accounts prior to such rounding, and the
Accounts of such Participants shall be increased to the next higher whole share
in their order of ranking, one by one, until the number of shares allocated to
the Participants' Accounts equals the number of shares of the Company's
securities held by the Trust.

                                    ARTICLE 6
                                   BENEFICIARY

        6.1 The Participant's Enrollment Agreement shall designate the
Beneficiary who is to receive a distribution of the value of a Participant's
Account in the event of such Participant's



                                       8.
<PAGE>   11

death. If the Participant has not properly designated a Beneficiary, or if for
any reason such designation shall not be legally effective, or if said
designated Beneficiary shall predecease the Participant, then the Participant's
Beneficiary shall be determined by the terms of the Executive Retirement Plan.
The other terms and conditions of a Participant's selection of a Beneficiary
shall also be determined by the Executive Retirement Plan.

                                    ARTICLE 7
                                     VESTING

        7.1 The value of a Participant's Account at the time of vesting (i.e.,
to the extent not forfeited earlier) shall vest in accordance with whichever one
of the following schedules results in the largest vested balance in such
Participant's Account:

               (a) One hundred percent (100%) shall be vested upon the
occurrence of such Participant's death, termination of employment on account of
total and permanent disability, or attainment of Normal Retirement Age while
employed by the Employer. "Total and permanent disability" means a medically
determinable physical or mental impairment which renders the Participant unable
to engage in any substantial gainful activity and which can be expected to
result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous
period of not less than twelve (12) months.

               (b) One hundred percent (100%) of all contributions
(discretionary and non-discretionary) made on the Participant's behalf for a
Plan Year shall be vested on the first day of the eleventh Plan Year that
follows such Plan Year, provided that the Participant has not terminated
employment with all Employers by that date.

               (c) For a Participant who has attained at least age 61 and has
completed three (3) Years of Service for Vesting (as defined in the Executive
Retirement Plan), then the value of such Participant's Account shall be vested
on the day on which the foregoing conditions are satisfied, provided that the
Participant has not terminated employment with all Employers by that date (the
"Age 61 & 3 Vesting Date"), in an amount determined by multiplying the value of
such Participant's Account, on such date, by the product of 20% multiplied by
the number of whole years (with fractional years rounded down) by which such
Participant's age exceeds 60. On each anniversary of the Age 61 & 3 Vesting Date
thereafter, the vested value of such Participant's Account shall be recalculated
again by using the formula for calculating the vested value of such
Participant's Account on the Age 61 & 3 Vesting Date, provided that the
Participant has not terminated employment with all Employers by that date.

               (d) In determining the vesting of persons who were Participants
in the Plan on or prior to April 24, 1998, the following vesting schedule shall
also be considered. Upon satisfaction of the age and service requirements for
Early Retirement Age while employed by the Employer, then such a Participant's
Account shall become vested in that percentage determined according to the
following formula: one hundred percent (100%) reduced by ten percent (10%) for
each full six-month period during which the Participant must remain employed
with the Employer in order to reach his or her Normal Retirement Age while
employed by the Employer. Upon completing each additional six-month period of
employment with the Employer after



                                       9.
<PAGE>   12

having attained Early Retirement Age while employed by the Employer, such a
Participant's Account shall be vested in an additional ten percent (10%).

               (e) Partially or fully vested in the complete discretion of the
Compensation Committee.

               (f) One hundred percent (100%) vested in the event of a Change of
Control, if at any time within twenty-four (24) months of the Change of Control,
the Participant's employment with the Employer is involuntarily terminated by
the Employer without Cause, or if such employment is voluntarily terminated by
the Participant with Good Reason (which Good Reason must occur at or after the
time of the Change of Control).

               (g) Effective January 1, 2000, for determining the vesting of
contributions (whenever made) to the account of a person who is a Participant on
or after that date the following schedule shall also be considered: twenty-five
percent (25%) of the contributions relating to a given Plan Year (including any
earnings thereon) shall vest at the end of each Plan Year thereafter; provided,
however, that (i) the Participant is an employee of the Employer for the entire
duration of such subsequent Plan Year, and (ii) the Participant is deferring
compensation into the Executive Retirement Plan during that subsequent Plan
Year. If the Participant takes an unpaid leave of absence that either is
approved by the Employer or is legally required to be made available to the
Participant, and from which it is anticipated that the Participant will return
to service as an employee of the Employer, then the duration of that leave of
absence will not be considered for purposes of determining whether the
Participant has been employed for the entire duration of a Plan Year (e.g.,
vacation, sabbatical, paid time off for illness or injury of the Participant or
to care for a member of the Participant's family or circle of friends due to
that person's illness or injury are instances in which the Participant would be
anticipated to return to active service as an employee of the Employer). If the
Participant is not an employee of the Employer for the entire duration of a
subsequent Plan Year or is not deferring compensation into the Executive
Retirement Plan during such subsequent Plan Year, then all further vesting under
this provision shall be suspended for that Participant. Suspended vesting
installments relating to contributions made to a Participant's Account for a
particular Plan Year shall vest as follows: (i) the suspended vesting
installment that would have been first to vest if the above conditions had been
met shall vest at the end of the next Plan Year following such suspension in
which (A) the Participant is an employee of the Employer for the entire duration
of such Plan Year, and (B) the Participant is deferring compensation into the
Executive Retirement Plan during such Plan Year; and (ii) only one suspended
vesting installment of the suspended vesting installments relating to
contributions made for a particular Plan Year shall vest in that later Plan
Year. The other suspended vesting installments relating to contributions made to
a Participant's Account for a particular Plan Year shall vest one at a time in
later Plan Years in which the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence are
met.

        7.2 For purposes of Sections 7.1(b), (c) and (d) (including the
calculation of Years of Service for Vesting), a Participant's service and
employment with Leap Wireless International, Inc. ("Leap") shall be treated as
service and employment with the Employer if such Participant commenced
employment with Leap on or before October 1, 1998 and such employment was
immediately subsequent to employment with the Employer.



                                      10.
<PAGE>   13

        7.3 For purposes of Sections 7.1(b), (c) and (d) (including the
calculation of Years of Service for Vesting), a Participant's service and
employment with Wireless Knowledge, Inc. ("WK") shall be treated as service and
employment with the Employer if such Participant (i) received a discretionary
contribution pursuant to Section 3.2, (ii) commenced employment with WK on or
before April 1, 1999 and (iii) such employment was concurrent with, or
immediately subsequent to, employment with the Employer or an Affiliate.

        7.4 Notwithstanding the vesting of some or all of the amounts credited
to Participants' Accounts under the Plan, all amounts credited to all
Participants' Accounts shall remain available to satisfy the claims of the
Company's creditors in the event of the Company's financial insolvency as
defined in the Trust Agreement. Amounts credited to a Participant's Account
which are not vested at the time that the Participant terminates employment with
the Employer shall be forfeited and applied to reduce the Company's future
contributions or to pay costs associated with the operation and administration
of the Plan. A Participant who forfeits any such amounts shall have no rights to
the restoration of such amounts in the event that he or she once again becomes
employed by the Employer and is eligible to participate in the Plan.

                                    ARTICLE 8
                            DISTRIBUTION OF BENEFITS

        8.1 A Participant shall automatically receive a distribution of his or
her vested benefits in the Plan as soon as administratively reasonable following
the termination of the Participant's employment with the Employer. The amount of
such distribution shall be equal to the final balance of such vested benefits
credited to such Participant's Account as of the date of such termination, plus
any subsequent contributions. The distribution shall be paid only in whole
shares of the Company's common stock or stock of Leap Wireless International,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and any succeeding or continuing corporation of the
foregoing. A distribution of vested benefits will be made to such Participant
based upon the payment option elected by the Participant. The forms of payment
options and the terms and conditions for making and changing an election
regarding a payment option shall be the same as provided for under the Executive
Retirement Plan.

        8.2 Any benefits paid upon the death of a Participant must be paid to
the Beneficiary designated by such Participant in the Enrollment Agreement. Such
death benefits shall be paid in the form of payment determined under the
Executive Retirement Plan.

        8.3 In the event that a Participant or Beneficiary elects to receive his
or her distribution in the form of installment payments in accordance with the
terms of the Executive Retirement Plan, the Plan Administrator shall require
that all installment payments be made solely in whole shares of the Company's
common stock and shall direct the Trustee to make such payments in accordance
with that requirement.

        8.4 The Plan Administrator shall have the authority to withhold from a
distribution to a Participant or Beneficiary or from a Participant's Account any
amount needed to satisfy the Employer's income or employment withholding tax
obligations with respect to such distribution



                                      11.
<PAGE>   14

or upon the vesting of a Participant's Account and may also arrange with the
Participant to allow the Participant to make payment to the Employer to satisfy
such obligations.

        8.5 In the event that any distribution from the Plan received or to be
received by a Participant (a "Distribution") would (i) constitute a "parachute
payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and (ii) but for this
Section 8.5, cause the Participant to become subject to the excise tax imposed
by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax") or increase such Participant's
Excise Tax liability, then such Distribution may be reduced to the largest
amount which the Participant, in his or her sole discretion, determines would
result in no portion of the Distribution being subject to the Excise Tax. The
determination by a Participant of any reduction shall be conclusive and binding
upon the Employer, the Company, and the Plan Administrator. The Plan
Administrator shall reduce a Distribution only upon written notice by the
Participant indicating the amount of such reduction and/or shall accept the
return of some or all of a Distribution previously made to a Participant. Any
amounts returned to the Plan pursuant to this Section 8.5 shall be treated as a
forfeiture and shall be used to reduce the Company's future contributions to the
Plan or to pay costs associated with the operation and administration of the
Plan.

        8.6 For purposes of this Article 8, the following shall be deemed to be
employment of the Participant with the Employer: (i) employment by an Affiliate,
(ii) the provision of consulting services to the Employer or Affiliate, (iii)
employment by Leap Wireless International, Inc. that commences prior to October
1, 1998, and is simultaneous with or immediately after employment with the
Employer or an Affiliate, and (iv) if the Participant has received a
discretionary contribution pursuant to Section 3.2, then employment by WK that
commences prior to April 1, 1999, and is simultaneous with or immediately after
employment with the Employer or an Affiliate.

                                    ARTICLE 9
                                 ADMINISTRATION

        9.1 The Plan Administrator shall be a committee of one or more
individuals which has the authority to control and manage the operation and
administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator may also be referred to as
the Plan Committee. Administrative concerns of the Plan include, but are not
limited to, the enrollment of Eligible Employees as Participants, the
maintenance of all records, the direction of the Trustee to distribute benefits
to Participants and their Beneficiaries, the interpretation of the Plan, and the
establishment of rules and procedures for the operation of the Plan Committee.
The initial number of members of the Plan Committee shall be three (3), until
such number is changed by the approval of the majority of the Plan Committee. A
member of the Plan Committee must be an employee of the Employer or member of
the Board and shall continue to serve until such member (i) resigns, (ii) is
removed or (iii) terminates employment with the Employer and no longer serves on
the Board for any reason. The approval of at least two-thirds of the members of
the Plan Committee shall be required to remove a member of the Plan Committee. A
majority of the remaining members of the Plan Committee may fill one or more
vacancies on the Plan Committee. The Plan Committee may allocate and delegate
some or all of its responsibilities described in this Article 9. The Plan
Committee's authority under this Article 9.1 shall at times be subject to the
ability of the



                                      12.
<PAGE>   15

Compensation Committee to remove any or all of the members of the Plan Committee
for any reason, change the number of members of the Plan Committee, fill
vacancies on such committee, and establish rules and procedures for such
committee.

        9.2 Any decision or action of the Plan Administrator with respect to any
question arising out of or in connection with the administration, interpretation
and application of the Plan and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
or a Participant's Enrollment Agreement shall be final and conclusive and
binding upon all persons having any interest in the Plan.

        9.3 All costs and expenses related to the operation and administration
of the Plan shall be paid by the Company.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        10.1 AMENDMENT OF PLAN. The Company reserves the right to amend any
provisions of the Plan at any time upon an action by a majority of the Plan
Committee or the Compensation Committee to the extent that it may deem advisable
without the consent of the Participant or any Beneficiary; provided, however,
that no such amendment shall impair the rights of any Participant or Beneficiary
with respect to either contributions made or authorized before such amendment or
any earnings on such contributions credited to a Participant's Account before
such amendment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the formula for determining the
Employer's contributions may only be amended by the Board or the Compensation
Committee. Any such amendment to the Plan shall be submitted for the approval of
the Company's stockholders if such approval is required to comply with the
requirements of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, or the terms of any listing agreement with any established
securities exchange or automated quotation system (including NASDAQ) on which
the Company's common stock is listed for trading, or for any other reason
determined by the Board or the Compensation Committee after consulting with
legal counsel.

        10.2 TERMINATION OF PLAN. The Company reserves the right to terminate
the Plan at any time upon an action by the Board or the Compensation Committee.
Distribution of any benefits to a Participant shall generally commence only upon
the occurrence of the termination of employment of a Participant; provided,
however, that the Plan Administrator shall retain the sole discretion to make
payment to a Participant in the form of a single, lump sum distribution at any
time following the termination of the Plan.

        10.3   TRANSFERS TO OTHER PLANS.

               (a) In the event that a Participant employed by the Employer or
an Affiliate of the Employer simultaneously or subsequently becomes employed by
Leap Wireless International, Inc., the Plan Administrator shall have the right,
but no obligation, to direct the Trustee to transfer funds in an amount equal to
the amount credited to such Participant's Account (the "Transferred Account") to
a trust established under a Transferee Plan. The Plan Administrator shall
determine, in its sole discretion, whether such transfer shall be made and the



                                      13.
<PAGE>   16

timing of such transfer. Such transfer shall be made only if, and to the extent
that, approval of such transfer is obtained from the Trustee.

               (b) For purposes of this Section 10.3, "Transferee Plan" shall
mean an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan described in Sections
201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 ("ERISA") maintained by Leap Wireless International, Inc.

               (c) No transfer shall be made under this Section 10.3 unless the
Participant for whose benefit the Transferred Account is held executes a written
waiver of all of such Participant's rights and benefits under this Plan in such
form as shall be acceptable to the Plan Administrator.

        10.4   TRANSFERS IN FROM OTHER PLANS.

               There may be transferred directly from the trustee of another
nonqualified, unfunded, deferred compensation plan ("Other Plan") to the
Trustee, subject to the approval of the transferor corporation maintaining the
Other Plan, the Plan Administrator, and the Eligible Employee, funds in an
amount not to exceed the amount credited to the Other Plan accounts maintained
for the benefit of that Eligible Employee. Amounts transferred pursuant to this
Section 10.4, and any gains or losses allocable thereto, (i) shall be accounted
for separately ("Transfer Account") from amounts otherwise allocable to the
Eligible Employee under this Plan, and (ii) the Transfer Account shall be
distributed in accordance with the Eligible Employee's deferral election under
the Other Plan, as such election may be amended pursuant to the terms of the
Other Plan. Subsequent earnings on the amount in the Transfer Account shall be
credited to a separate account for the Eligible Employee established pursuant to
this Plan and shall be determined under the Plan's investment procedures in
Article 5.

        10.5 The Plan Administrator may at any time make rules as it determines
necessary regarding the administration of the Plan which are not inconsistent
with the Plan.

        10.6 The Plan Administrator may, from time to time, hire outside
consultants, accountants, actuaries, legal counsel, or recordkeepers to perform
such tasks as the Plan Administrator may from time to time determine.

        10.7 In the event that any Participants are found to be ineligible, that
is, not members of a select group of management or highly compensated employees
eligible to participate in a Top Hat Plan, according to a determination made by
the United States Department of Labor, the Plan Administrator will take whatever
steps it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to equitably protect the
interests of the affected Participants.

        10.8 No benefits under the Plan shall be subject in any manner to
anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance,
attachment or garnishment. The provisions of the Plan shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Company, the Employer and Participants and their
respective successors, heirs, personal representatives, executors,
administrators, and legatees.



                                      14.
<PAGE>   17

        Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary, any
amount credited to a Participant's Account shall be paid from the Trust only to
the extent that the Company is not financially insolvent at the time of such
payment. Whether or not the Company is financially insolvent shall be determined
by the Trustee in the Trustee's sole discretion based upon the standard for
financial insolvency set forth in the Trust Agreement. Any benefits under the
Plan represent an unfunded, unsecured promise by the Company to pay these
benefits to the Participants when due. A Participant has no greater right to any
assets in the Trust than the general creditors of the Company in the event that
the Company shall become financially insolvent. Trust assets can be used to pay
only benefits under the Plan or the claims of the Company's general creditors or
the expenses of administering the Plan and Trust to the extent permitted under
the terms of the Trust Agreement.

        10.9 The Plan, the Trust Agreement, and the Participant's Enrollment
Agreement, and any subsequently adopted amendment to any of these documents,
shall constitute the total agreement or contract between the Company and such
Participant regarding the Plan. No oral statement regarding the Plan may be
relied upon by the Participant. If there are any conflicts between the terms of
the Plan and the Trust Agreement, and a Participant's Enrollment Agreement, the
terms of the Plan and the Trust Agreement shall control.

        10.10 The terms and conditions of the Plan shall not be deemed to
constitute a contract of employment between the Employer and the Participant.
Such employment is hereby acknowledged to be an "at will" employment
relationship that can be terminated at any time for any reason, with or without
cause, unless expressly provided in a written employment agreement or expressly
provided by law. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give a Participant the
right to be retained in the service of the Employer, or to interfere with the
right of the Employer to discipline or discharge the Participant at any time.

        10.11 If any change is made to the Company's common stock because of a
change in the Company's capital structure not involving the receipt of
consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization, stock dividend, dividend in property other
than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of
shares, change in corporate structure or otherwise, then the class(es) and
number of shares that may be contributed by the Company under Section 3.8 and
the class(es) and number of shares held by the Trust will be appropriately
adjusted to reflect the impact of such change upon the Company's stockholders.
The conversion of any convertible securities issued by the Company shall not be
considered a transaction "involving the receipt of consideration by the
Company." In the event that such change causes the Trust to hold substantially
all of its assets in securities of the Company or a successor corporation to the
Company other than the Company's common stock, references in the Plan to the
Company's common stock shall mean such securities. After the occurrence of a
transaction described in this Section 10.11, the rounding rules set forth in
Section 5.5 shall be applied to ensure that each Participant's Account shall be
invested in the shares of the Company's common stock (or such other securities)
and shall be accounted for and reported in terms of whole shares of the
Company's common stock (or such other securities).

        10.12 The Company shall seek to obtain from each regulatory commission
or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan the authority as may be required to
contribute and distribute



                                      15.
<PAGE>   18

shares of the Company's common stock; provided, however, that this undertaking
shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or comparable securities law of any other applicable jurisdiction,
shares of the Company's common stock or any participation interest in the Plan
deemed to be a security. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to
obtain from any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel
for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance of stock to the Plan or
distribution of stock from the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any
liability for failure to issue the Company's common stock to the Plan, and the
Company, Employer, Plan Administrator and/or the Trustee shall be relieved from
any liability for failure to distribute the Company's common stock from the
Plan, as applicable, unless and until such authority is obtained.

        10.13 This Plan shall be construed under the laws of the State of
California, except to the extent that the laws of the State are preempted by
ERISA.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Plan is hereby adopted by a duly authorized
officer of QUALCOMM, Incorporated on this __ day of ________, 1999.

                                        QUALCOMM, INC.
