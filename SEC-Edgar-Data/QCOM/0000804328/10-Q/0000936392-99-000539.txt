                              QUALCOMM INCORPORATED
              NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                   (UNAUDITED)

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

    The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by QUALCOMM Incorporated (the "Company" or "QUALCOMM"), without
audit, in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not
necessarily include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair
presentation of its financial position, results of operations and cash flows in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The condensed
consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 1998 was derived from the audited
consolidated balance sheet at that date which is not presented herein. The
Company operates and reports using a period ending on the last Sunday of each
month.

    In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial information for the
interim periods presented reflects all adjustments (which include only normal,
recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation. These condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
September 27, 1998. Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of operating results for an entire fiscal year.

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    Revenue from communications systems and products is generally recognized at
the time the units are shipped and over the period during which message and
warranty services are provided, except for shipments under arrangements
involving significant acceptance requirements. Under such arrangements, revenue
is recognized when the Company has substantially met its performance
obligations. Other criteria considered for the purpose of revenue recognition
include the customer's financial condition, the amount and quality of financial
support provided by the customer's investors, and the political and economic
environment in which the customer operates. Revenue from long-term contracts and
revenue earned under license and development agreements with continuing
performance obligations is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method,
based either on costs incurred to date compared with total estimated costs at
completion or using a units of delivery methodology. Billings on uncompleted
contracts in excess of incurred cost and accrued profits are classified as
unearned revenue. Estimated contract losses are recognized when determined.
Non-refundable license fees are recognized when there is no material continuing
performance obligation under the agreement and collection is probable.

    Royalty revenue is recorded as earned in accordance with the specific terms
of each license agreement when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made.
Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company began to accrue
its estimate of certain royalty revenues earned that previously could not be
reasonably estimated prior to being reported by its licensees.

    Basic earnings (loss) per common share are calculated by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
reporting period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share reflect the potential
dilutive effect, determined by the treasury stock method, of additional common
shares that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and
warrants, as follows (in thousands):

    The computation of the diluted loss per share for the three months ended
March 28, 1999 excludes approximately 5,515,000 additional common shares that
are issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options, calculated using the
treasury stock method, because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options
outstanding during the three months ended March 28, 1999 and March 29, 1998 to
purchase approximately 77,000 and 4,181,000 shares of common stock,
respectively, and options outstanding during the six months ended March 28, 1999
and March 29, 1998 to purchase approximately 3,358,000 and 2,662,000 shares of
common stock, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS
because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of
the common stock during the period and, therefore, the effect would be
anti-dilutive. The conversion of the Trust Convertible Preferred Securities is
not assumed for all periods presented since its effect would be anti-dilutive.

    The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130
("FAS 130"), "Reporting Comprehensive Income," in the first quarter of fiscal
1999. As required by the statement, the Company displays the accumulated balance
of other comprehensive income or loss separately in the equity section of the
consolidated balance sheets. Prior year financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Total comprehensive
income (loss), which was comprised of net income (loss) and foreign currency
adjustments, amounted to approximately ($71.9) million and $25.8 million for the
three months ended March 28, 1999 and March 29, 1998, respectively, and ($23.8)
million and $62.4 million for the six months ended March 28, 1999 and March 29,
1998, respectively.

    In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131 ("FAS 131"), "Disclosures
about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information," which the Company will
be required to adopt for fiscal year 1999. This statement establishes standards
for reporting information about operating segments in annual financial
statements and requires selected information about operating segments in interim
financial reports issued to shareholders. It also establishes standards for
related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major
customers. Under FAS 131, operating segments are to be determined consistent
with the way that management organizes and evaluates financial information
internally for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company
has not completed its determination of the impact of the adoption of this new
accounting standard on its consolidated financial statement disclosures.

    In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133 ("FAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," which the Company will be required to adopt for fiscal year 2000.
This statement establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and
hedging activities. Under FAS 133, all derivatives must be recognized as assets
and liabilities and measured at fair value. The Company has not determined the
impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on its consolidated
financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 2 - SPIN-OFF OF LEAP WIRELESS INTERNATIONAL, INC.

On September 23, 1998, the Company completed the spin-off and distribution (the
"Distribution" or "Leap Wireless Spin-off") to its stockholders of shares of
Leap Wireless International, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Leap Wireless") and
recorded a $17.1 million liability in connection with its agreement to transfer
its ownership interest in Telesystems of Ukraine ("TOU") and its working capital
loan receivable from TOU ("TOU assets") to Leap Wireless if certain events
occurred within 18 months of the Leap Wireless Spin-off. During the first six
months of fiscal 1999, the Company provided an additional $1.7 million working
capital loan to TOU and recorded 100% of the losses of TOU, net of eliminations,
because the other investors' equity interests are depleted. During March 1999,
the Company reassessed the recoverability of TOU assets in light of recent
developments affecting the TOU business and the disposition of other assets
related to the terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business (Note 7). As a
result, the Company recorded a $15.1 million non-operating charge to write off
the TOU assets, as well as a $12.0 million charge to operations to write off
other assets related to the TOU contract (Note 7), and the adjusted liability to
transfer TOU to Leap Wireless of $15.1 million was reversed against equity as an
adjustment to the Distribution.



                                       8
<PAGE>   9
    In connection with the Distribution, Leap Wireless issued to QUALCOMM a
warrant to purchase 5,500,000 shares of Leap Wireless common stock at $6.10625
per share. The Company recorded the warrant at its predecessor basis of $24.2
million net of the related deferred tax liability. In March 1999, the Company
agreed to reduce the number of shares under warrant to 4,500,000 in exchange for
$3.0 million in consideration from Leap Wireless, resulting in a pre-tax loss of
$3.3 million. The cancellation was done to give further assurance that Leap
Wireless will meet the FCC criteria for designated entity status.

    Finance receivables result from sales under arrangements in which the
Company has agreed to provide customers with long-term interest bearing debt
financing for the purchase of equipment and/or services. Such financing is
generally collateralized by the related equipment.

    At March 28, 1999, commitments to extend long-term financing for possible
future sales to customers totaled approximately $276 million through fiscal
2003. Such commitments are subject to the customers meeting certain conditions
established in the financing arrangements. Commitments represent the estimated
amounts to be financed under these arrangements; actual financing may be in
lesser amounts. These commitments will be included in the total finance
commitments provided in connection with the disposition of assets (Note 7).

NOTE 4 - INVESTMENTS IN OTHER ENTITIES

    In November 1998, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into a joint
venture agreement pursuant to which each company obtained a 50% ownership
interest in a newly formed development stage entity, Wireless Knowledge LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company. Wireless Knowledge intends to form strategic
partnerships with computing, software and telecommunications companies, as well
as with wireless carriers, for the purpose of enabling secure and
airlink-independent internet access to mobile users. Pursuant to the joint
venture agreement, QUALCOMM made a capital contribution of $7.5 million during
the first quarter of fiscal 1999 and will be required to provide $17.5 million
in additional equity contributions through June 2000.

    In January 1999, Canbra Holdings S.A. ("Canbra"), a Brazilian company formed
by a consortium, comprised of Bell Canada International Ltd., WLL International,
SLI Wireless S.A., Taquari Participacoes S.A., and the Company, won a bid for an
operating license to provide wireless and wireline telephone services in the
northern region of Brazil. The Company invested $2.4 million during the second
quarter of fiscal 1999 in connection with its 16.2% ownership interest in
Canbra. The Company expects to make additional equity contributions of
approximately $46 million over the next three years.

    During the first six months of fiscal 1999, the Company recognized a gain of
$5.7 million from the sale of available-for-sale securities.

NOTE 5 - BANK LINES OF CREDIT

    On March 11, 1998, the Company and a group of banks entered into a $400
million unsecured revolving credit agreement ("Credit Facility I") under which
the banks are committed to make loans to the Company and to extend letters of
credit on behalf of the Company. Credit Facility I expires in March 2001 and may
be extended on an annual basis thereafter, subject to approval of a requisite
percentage of the lenders. At the Company's option, interest is at the
applicable LIBOR rate or the greater of the administrative agent's reference
rate or 0.5% plus the Federal Funds effective rate, each plus an applicable
margin. The amount available for borrowing is reduced by letters of credit
outstanding. The Company is currently obligated to pay commitment fees equal to
0.2% per annum on the unused amount of the $400 million credit commitment.
Credit Facility I includes certain restrictive financial and operating
covenants. As of March 28, 1999, there were $7.7 million letters of credit
issued, and no amounts outstanding, under Credit Facility I.

    On March 4, 1999, the Company and a group of banks entered into a $200
million unsecured revolving credit agreement ("Credit Facility II") under which
the banks are committed to make loans to the Company. Credit Facility II expires
in March 2000. At the Company's option, amounts outstanding in March 2000 may be
converted to a one-year term loan with a final maturity of March 2001. Interest
is payable at the greater of the administrative agent's reference rate or 0.5%
plus the Federal Funds effective rate, each plus an applicable margin. The
Company is currently obligated to pay commitment fees equal to 0.2% per annum on
the unused amount of the $200 million credit commitment. Credit Facility II
includes certain restrictive financial and operating covenants. As of March 28,
1999, there were no amounts outstanding under Credit Facility II.

NOTE 6 - RESTRUCTURING

    During January 1999, the Company completed a review of its operating
structure to identify opportunities to improve operating effectiveness. As a
result of this review, management approved a formal restructuring plan, and the
Company recorded a pretax restructuring charge to operations of $14.6 million.
The restructuring charge was comprised of employee termination benefits and
facility exit costs resulting primarily from the Company's plan to exit certain
activities in its infrastructure business. Facility exit costs include $3.5
million of asset impairments and $0.9 million of estimated net losses on
subleases or lease cancellation penalties.

    The employee termination benefits included in the restructuring charge
reflect the immediate elimination of approximately 650 positions identified in
the restructuring plan. Severance payments will continue beyond the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 1999 due to the provisions of the severance program.



                                       10
<PAGE>   11
    The restructuring plan specifically identified seven facilities to be
closed, including one administrative office and six international sales offices.
The Company expects to complete implementation of the plan by the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 2000.

    The following table sets forth the restructuring provision and related
activity as of March 28, 1999 (in thousands):

NOTE 7 - DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND OTHER CHARGES

    On March 24, 1999 the Company and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson
("Ericsson") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") for the
sale by the Company to Ericsson of certain assets related to the Company's
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business. The Company and Ericsson also
entered into various license and settlement agreements in connection therewith,
all of which are effective upon the closing of the sale (the "Closing"). The
Closing is subject to certain customary closing conditions. The Company recorded
a charge of $60.4 million in other operating expenses to reflect the difference
between the carrying value of the net assets and the consideration to be
received from Ericsson, less costs to sell. The estimated loss before income
taxes for the business to be disposed of included in the results of operations
for the six months ended March 28, 1999 was approximately $110 million.

    In addition, the Company and Ericsson agreed to jointly support a single
worldwide CDMA standard with three optional modes for the next generation of
wireless communications and have agreed to settle all of the existing litigation
between the companies and enter into cross-licenses for portions of their
respective CDMA patent portfolios. As part of the agreements, the Company and
Ericsson will each commit to the International Telecommunication Union ("ITU")
and to other standard bodies to license their essential patents for the single
CDMA standard or any of its modes to the rest of the industry on a fair and
reasonable basis free from unfair discrimination.

    Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will extend up to $400 million in
financing for possible future sales by Ericsson of cdmaOne or cdma2000
infrastructure equipment and related services to specific customers in certain
geographic areas, including Brazil, Chile, Russia, and Mexico or in other areas
selected by Ericsson. Such commitments are subject to the customers meeting
certain conditions established in the financing arrangements and, in most cases,
to Ericsson also financing a portion of such cdmaOne or cdma2000 sales.
Commitments represent the estimated amounts to be financed under these
arrangements, however, actual financing may be in lesser amounts.

    As a result of the Ericsson transaction, the Company reassessed the
recoverability of the carrying value of remaining assets relating to its
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business. The Company recorded a charge
of $20.8 million in other operating expenses to reduce the carrying value of
certain other assets to their approximate net realizable value, including $12.0
million in other assets related to the TOU contract (Note 2). The Company also
recorded $52.5 million in non-operating charges, including $37.4 million in
reserves provided for financial guarantees on projects which the Company will no
longer pursue as a result of the Ericsson transaction and $15.1 million related
to the write-off of TOU assets (Note 2). The Company estimates that additional
charges in the third quarter of fiscal 1999 relating to the disposition of the
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business will total approximately $100
million (Note 10).

NOTE 8 - INCOME TAXES

   The Company's income tax provision for the six months ended March 28, 1999
reflects an adjustment for the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit
in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. Excluding this adjustment, the Company
currently estimates its annual effective income tax rate to be approximately 35%
for fiscal 1999.

NOTE 9 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

LITIGATION

    On September 23, 1996, Ericsson Inc. and Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson
("Ericsson") filed suit against the Company in Marshall, Texas and on December
17, 1996, Ericsson also filed suit against the Company's subsidiary QUALCOMM
Personal Electronics ("QPE") in Dallas, Texas with both complaints alleging that
the Company's or QPE's CDMA products infringe one or more patents owned by
Ericsson. The suits were later amended to include a total of eleven Ericsson
patents. By order dated July 24, 1998, the Dallas action was transferred to
Marshall, Texas. In December 1996, QUALCOMM filed a countersuit alleging, among
other things, breach of a nondisclosure agreement by Ericsson and a pattern of
conduct intended to impede the acceptance and commercial deployment of
QUALCOMM's CDMA technology and is seeking a judicial declaration that certain of
Ericsson's patents are not infringed by QUALCOMM and are invalid. That
countersuit has been consolidated with the Marshall, Texas action. On September
10, 1996, OKI America, Inc. ("OKI") filed a complaint against Ericsson seeking a
judicial declaration that certain of OKI's CDMA subscriber products do not
infringe nine patents of Ericsson and that such patents are invalid. The nine
patents are among the eleven patents at issue in the litigation between the
Company and Ericsson. The OKI case has not yet been set for trial. On October
14, 1998, Ericsson filed a dismissal with prejudice of all of its claims under
three of the patents at issue in the Marshall, Texas case. On March 24, 1999,
the Company and Ericsson entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (Note 7) for
the sale by the Company to Ericsson of certain assets related to the Company's
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business and also entered into various
license and settlement agreements in connection therewith, all of which are
effective upon the Closing. The Closing is subject to certain customary closing
conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. Upon the
Closing, the Company, QPE and Ericsson will dismiss with prejudice all of their
respective claims and counterclaims against each other. Pending the Closing, the
Company and Ericsson have agreed to a stay of all litigation effective March 25,
1999. In the event the Closing does not occur by July 25, 1999, the stay will be
lifted.

    On March 5, 1997, the Company filed a complaint against Motorola, Inc.
("Motorola"). The complaint was filed in response to allegations by Motorola
that the Company's then, recently announced, Q phone infringes design and
utility patents held by Motorola as well as trade dress and common law rights
relating to the appearance of certain Motorola wireless telephone products. The
complaint denies such allegations and seeks a judicial declaration that the
Company's products do not infringe any patents held by Motorola. On March 10,
1997, Motorola filed a complaint against the Company (the "Motorola Complaint"),
alleging claims based primarily on the above-alleged infringement. The Company's
motion to transfer the Motorola Complaint to the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of California was granted on April 3, 1997. On April 24, 1997,
the court denied Motorola's motion for a preliminary injunction thereby
permitting the Company to continue to manufacture, market and sell the Q phone.
On April 25, 1997, Motorola appealed the denial of its motion for a preliminary
injunction. On January 16, 1998 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit denied Motorola's appeal and affirmed the decision of the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of California refusing Motorola's request to
enjoin QUALCOMM from manufacturing and selling the Q phone. On June 4, 1997,
Motorola filed another lawsuit alleging infringement by QUALCOMM of 4 patents.
Three of the patents had already been alleged in previous litigation between the
parties. On August 18, 1997, Motorola filed another complaint against the
Company alleging infringement by the Company of 7 additional patents. All of the
Motorola cases have been consolidated for pretrial proceedings. The cases have
been set for a final pretrial conference on August 1, 1999. Although there can
be no assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the dispute would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or
financial position, the Company believes Motorola's claims are without merit and
will continue to vigorously defend the action.

    On October 27, 1998, the Electronics and Telecommunications Research
Institute of Korea ("ETRI") submitted to the International Chamber of Commerce a
Request for Arbitration (the "Request") of a dispute with the Company



                                       12
<PAGE>   13
arising out of a Joint Development Agreement dated April 30, 1992 ("JDA")
between ETRI and the Company. In the Request, ETRI alleges that the Company has
breached certain provisions of the JDA and seeks monetary damages and an
accounting. The Company filed an answer and counterclaims denying the
allegations, seeking a declaration establishing the termination of the JDA, and
for monetary damages and injunctive relief against ETRI. In accordance with the
JDA, the arbitration will take place in San Diego. No schedule for the
arbitration proceedings has been established. Although the ultimate resolution
of this dispute is subject to the uncertainties inherent in litigation or
arbitration, the Company does not believe that the resolution of these claims
will have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations,
liquidity or financial position. The Company believes that ETRI's claims are
without merit and will vigorously defend the action.

    On February 26, 1999, the Lemelson Medical, Education & Research Foundation,
Limited Partnership ("Lemelson"), filed an industry-wide action in the United
States District Court for the District of Arizona. The complaint names a total
of 88 parties, including the Company, as defendants and purports to assert
claims for infringement of 15 patents. The complaint alleges that application
specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") devices sold by the Company, or the
processes by which such devices are manufactured, infringe the asserted patents.
Because all of the ASICs sold by the Company are manufactured for the Company by
others, the Company will likely be entitled to be defended and indemnified by
its vendors with respect to many, and perhaps all, of its ASIC products. The
Company believes that the Lemelson claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position.
The Company believes the Lemelson claims are without merit and will vigorously
defend the action.

    On May 6, 1999, Thomas Sprague, an employee of the Company, filed a putative
class action against the Company, ostensibly on behalf of himself and those of
the Company's employees who have been offered employment with Ericsson in
conjunction with the sale to Ericsson of certain of the Company's infrastructure
division assets and liabilities (Note 7) and who have elected not to participate
in a Retention Bonus Plan being offered to such employees. The complaint was
filed in California Superior Court in and for the County of San Diego and
purports to state eight causes of action arising primarily out of alleged
breaches of the terms of the Company's 1991 Stock Option Plan, as amended from
time to time. The putative class seeks to include employees of the Company who
(among other things) "have not or will not execute the Bonus Retention Plan and
accompanying full and complete release of QUALCOMM." The complaint seeks an
order accelerating all unvested stock options for the members of the class. As
of May 7, 1999, 94 percent or more of the 1,053 transitioning employees who have
unvested stock options had chosen not to join the lawsuit and to participate
instead in the Retention Bonus Plan offered by QUALCOMM and Ericsson, which
provides several benefits including cash compensation based upon a portion of
the value of their unvested options. Although the Company believes the complaint
has no merit and intends to defend the action vigorously, there can be no
assurance that an unfavorable outcome of the action would not have a material
adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial
position.

    The Company is engaged in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course
of its business and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not
have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, liquidity or
financial position.

LETTERS OF CREDIT AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES

    The Company has issued a letter of credit on behalf of its equity investee
Globalstar, L.P. ("Globalstar") to support a guarantee of up to $22.5 million of
borrowings under an existing bank financing agreement. The guarantee will expire
in December 2000. The letter of credit is collateralized by a commensurate
amount of the Company's investments in debt securities. As of March 28, 1999,
Globalstar had no borrowings outstanding under the existing bank financing
agreement.

    In addition to the letter of credit on behalf of Globalstar, the Company has
$33.0 million of letters of credit and $4.7 million of other financial
guarantees outstanding, excluding those against which a reserve has been taken
as of March 28, 1999, none of which are collateralized.

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES

    The Company and its subsidiary, QPE, have entered into contracts that
provide for performance guarantees to protect customers against late delivery or
failure to perform. These performance guarantees, and any future commitments for
performance guarantees, are obligations entered into separately, and in some
cases jointly, with partners to supply CDMA subscriber and infrastructure
equipment. Certain of these obligations provide for substantial performance
guarantees that accrue at a daily rate based on percentages of the contract
value to the extent the equipment is not delivered by scheduled delivery dates
or the systems fail to meet certain performance criteria by such dates. The
Company is dependent in part on the performance of its suppliers and strategic
partners in order to provide equipment, which is the subject of the guarantees.
Thus, the ability to timely deliver such equipment may be outside of the
Company's control. If the Company and QPE are unable to meet their performance
obligations, the payment of the performance guarantees could amount to a
significant portion of the contract value and would have a material adverse
effect on product margins and the Company's results of operations, liquidity or
financial position.

LEAP WIRELESS CREDIT FACILITY

    The Company has a funding commitment to Leap Wireless in the form of a $265
million secured credit facility. The credit facility consists of two
sub-facilities. The first sub-facility enables Leap Wireless to borrow up to
$35.2



                                       13
<PAGE>   14
million from QUALCOMM, solely to meet the normal working capital and operating
expenses of Leap Wireless, including salaries, overhead and credit facility
fees, but excluding, among other things, strategic capital investments in
wireless operators, substantial acquisitions of capital products, and/or the
acquisition of telecommunications licenses. The other sub-facility enables Leap
Wireless to borrow up to $229.8 million from QUALCOMM, solely to use as
investment capital to make certain identified portfolio investments. Amounts
borrowed under the credit facility will be due September 23, 2006. QUALCOMM will
have a first priority security interest in, subject to minor exceptions,
substantially all of the assets of Leap Wireless for so long as any amounts are
outstanding under the credit facility. Amounts borrowed under the credit
facility will bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.25% per
annum. Interest will be payable quarterly beginning September 30, 2001; and
prior to such time, accrued interest shall be added to the principal amount
outstanding. At March 28, 1999, $45.2 million is outstanding under this
facility.

NOTE 10 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

    In April 1999, the Company announced that it will provide certain
compensation benefits to employees being transferred to Ericsson in connection
with the proposed sale of assets related to the Company's terrestrial CDMA
wireless infrastructure business (Note 7). The Company estimates that additional
charges in the third quarter of fiscal 1999 relating to the disposition of the
terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business will total approximately $100
million, primarily related to employee compensation benefits. This estimate is
largely based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock, and
therefore is subject to market fluctuations.

    On April 14, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-for-one
stock split of the Company's common stock. The stock dividend will be
distributed on May 10, 1999 to stockholders of record on April 21, 1999. Pro
forma earnings (loss) per common share, giving retroactive effect to the stock
split, are as follows:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND
FINANCIAL CONDITION

    This information should be read in conjunction with the condensed
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Item 1 of
Part I of this Quarterly Report and the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results
of Operations and Financial Condition for the year ended September 27, 1998
contained in the Company's 1998 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Except for the historical information contained herein, the following
discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. QUALCOMM Incorporated's ("QUALCOMM" or the "Company") future
results could differ materially from those discussed here. Factors that could
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not specifically
limited to: risks relating to the closing of the proposed Ericsson transaction,
including the occurrence of required closing conditions; the ability to develop
and introduce cost effective new products in a timely manner, avoiding delays in
the commercial implementation of the Code Division Multiple Access ("CDMA")
technology; continued growth in the CDMA subscriber population and the scale-up
and operations of CDMA systems; risks relating to the success of the Globalstar
system; developments in current or future litigation; the Company's ability to
effectively manage growth and the intense competition in the wireless
communications industry; risks associated with vendor financing; timing and
receipt of license fees and royalties; failure to satisfy performance
obligations; as well as the other risks detailed in this section, in the
sections entitled Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources, and
in the Company's 1998 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

OVERVIEW

    QUALCOMM is a leading provider of digital wireless communications products,
technologies and services. The Company generates revenues primarily from:
license fees and royalties paid by licensees of the Company's CDMA technology;
sales of CDMA subscriber, infrastructure and Application Specific Integrated
Circuits ("ASICs") products to domestic and international wireless
communications equipment suppliers and service providers; sales of OmniTRACS
terminals and related software and services to OmniTRACS users; and contract
development services, including the design and development of subscriber and
ground communications equipment for Globalstar L.P. ("Globalstar"), a
low-Earth-orbit satellite system utilizing CDMA technology (the "Globalstar
System"). In addition, the Company generates revenues from the design,
development, manufacture and sale of a variety of other communications products
and services.

    The Company generates revenue from its CDMA licensees in the form of
up-front licenses as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by such
licensees of CDMA subscriber and infrastructure equipment. License fees are
generally nonrefundable and may be paid in one or more installments. Revenues
generated from license fees and royalties are subject to quarterly and annual
fluctuations. This is due to variations in the amount and timing of recognition
of CDMA license fees, pricing and amount of sales by the Company's licensees and
the Company's ability to estimate such sales, and the impact of currency
fluctuations, and risks associated with royalties generated from international
licensees.

    The Company has manufactured CDMA infrastructure products for sale to
wireless network operators worldwide. On March 24, 1999, QUALCOMM and
Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson ("Ericsson") entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement for the sale by the Company to Ericsson of certain assets related to
the Company's terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business, subject to
certain customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory
approvals.

    The Company manufactures its CDMA subscriber products primarily through
QUALCOMM Personal Electronics ("QPE"), a joint venture between the Company and a
subsidiary of Sony Electronics, Inc. The Company, through QPE, is one of the
largest manufacturers of CDMA handsets. The Company also generates substantial
revenue from the design and sale of CDMA ASICs to its licensees for
incorporation into their subscriber and infrastructure products.



                                       15
<PAGE>   16
    The Company generates revenues from its domestic OmniTRACS business by
manufacturing and selling OmniTRACS terminals and related application software
packages and by providing ongoing messaging and maintenance services to domestic
OmniTRACS users. The Company generates revenues from its international OmniTRACS
business through license fees, sales of network products and terminals, and
service fees. International messaging services are provided by service providers
that operate network management centers for a region under licenses granted by
the Company.

    The Company has entered into a number of development and manufacturing
contracts involving the Globalstar System. The Company's development agreement
provides for the design and development of the ground communications stations
("gateways") and user terminals of the Globalstar System. Under the agreement,
the Company is reimbursed for its development services on a cost-plus basis. In
addition, in April 1997 the Company was awarded a contract to manufacture and
supply commercial gateways for deployment in the Globalstar System. In March
1998, the Company entered into an agreement with Globalstar to manufacture and
supply portable and fixed CDMA handsets that will operate on the Globalstar
System. The Globalstar system is still being deployed, and cannot begin
commercial operations until at least 32 satellites are working in orbit, the
necessary ground equipment and user terminals are in place and service providers
are licensed in the countries to be served. Satellite launches are risky, with
about 15% of attempts ending in failure. Globalstar has already had one launch
failure, and more failures may occur within the course of its launch campaign.
If another launch fails, the resulting increased costs, including those
associated with delay, could have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition and results of operations of Globalstar. The cost of installing the
Globalstar system has been revised upward from the original estimates, and
further increases are possible. Until the system is fully deployed and tested,
it is not certain that it will perform as designed. Even if the system operates
as it should, there is no certainty that the anticipated market will develop.

    Barring unexpected adverse developments, Globalstar will need approximately
$600 million more capital before it can begin commercial service in September
1999 as planned. Any delay in raising the necessary funds will delay the start
of commercial service. If the start of service is significantly delayed, a
larger proportion of Globalstar's debt services requirements will become due
before Globalstar has positive cash flow, which will increase the amount of
money Globalstar needs.

    The value of the Company's investment in and future business with
Globalstar, as well as its ability to collect outstanding receivables from
Globalstar, depends on the success of Globalstar and the Globalstar System.
Globalstar is a development stage company and has no operating history. From its
inception, Globalstar has incurred net losses and losses are expected to
continue at least until commercial operations of the Globalstar System commence,
which is expected to be in calendar 1999. A substantial shortfall in meeting
Globalstar's capital needs could prevent completion of the Globalstar System and
could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations,
liquidity and financial position. In addition, Globalstar can terminate its
development agreement with the Company if Globalstar abandons its efforts to
develop the Globalstar System.

    The manufacture of wireless communications products is a complex and precise
process involving specialized material, manufacturing and testing equipment and
processes. The majority of the Company's products are manufactured based upon a
forecast of market demand. The Company cannot assure the accuracy of its market
forecast or that it will be able to effectively meet customer demand in a timely
manner. Factors that could materially and adversely affect the Company's ability
to meet customer demand include defects or impurities in the components or
materials used, delays in the delivery of such components or materials,
equipment failures or other difficulties. The Company may experience component
failures or defects which could require significant product recalls, reworks
and/or repairs which are not covered by warranty reserves and which could
consume a substantial portion of the Company's manufacturing capacity.

    Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. accounted for approximately 32%
and 34% of total revenues for the six months ended March 28, 1999 and in fiscal
1998, respectively. Sales of subscriber, infrastructure and ASICs products,
internationally, are subject to a number of risks, including delays in opening
of foreign markets to new competitors, exchange controls, currency fluctuations,
investment policies, repatriation of cash, nationalization, social and political
risks, taxation and other factors, depending on the country in which such
opportunity arises.



                                       16

    Wireless and satellite network operators, both domestic and international,
increasingly have required their suppliers to arrange or provide long-term
financing for them as a condition to obtaining or bidding on infrastructure
projects. In providing such financing, the Company is exposed to risk from
fluctuations in foreign currency and interest rates, which could impact the
Company's results of operations and financial condition. QUALCOMM's financing on
products and services is denominated in dollars and any significant change in
the value of the dollar against the national currency where QUALCOMM is lending
could result in the increase of costs to the debtors and could restrict the
debtors from fulfilling their contractual obligations. Any devaluation in the
local currency relative to the currencies in which such liabilities are payable
could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In some developing
countries, including Chile, Mexico, Brazil, and Russia, significant currency
devaluations relative to the U.S. dollar have occurred and may occur again in
the future. In such circumstances, the Company may experience economic loss with
respect to the collectability of its receivables and the value of inventories as
a result of exchange rate fluctuations.

    During the commercial start-up of its system in Chile with Chilesat
Telefonia Personal, S.A. ("Chilesat PCS"), the Company's equipment experienced
certain problems relating to the performance of the system. As a result,
Chilesat PCS has claimed that the Company is in breach of warranty. The Company
has tested and delivered a processor upgrade, which the Company believes
resolves the claim. Although there can be no assurance that the Company's
processor upgrade will resolve the claim until the system is at specified
capacity, the Company does not believe that the resolution of this claim will
have a material adverse effect on the Company. Subsequent to quarter end,
Chilesat PCS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Leap Wireless.

    The Russian economic environment has experienced severe volatility, which
could negatively impact the Company's prospects and have a material adverse
effect on the Company's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial
position. The Company currently has approximately $17 million in Russian
receivables and an additional $26 million in products and deployment services
placed with carriers for which the Company has not yet recognized revenues. The
Company cannot guarantee that these carriers will have sufficient resources to
complete their planned projects. The failure of any of these emerging service
carriers to obtain sufficient financing to meet their regulatory obligations
could adversely affect the value of the Company's receivables and inventories
relating to these customers.

    A review of the Company's current litigation is disclosed in the Notes to
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (see Notes to Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements--Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies). The Company is also
engaged in other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of its business
and believes that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material
adverse effect on its results of operations, liquidity or financial position.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

    The Company's terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business has
continued to incur losses, and the recent financial crisis in developing markets
has materially impacted infrastructure products sales in fiscal 1999. In January
1999, management approved a formal restructuring plan. As a result, the Company
recorded a pretax restructuring charge to operations of $15 million. The charge
was comprised of employee termination benefits and facility exit costs resulting
primarily from the Company's plan to exit certain activities in its
infrastructure business.

    On March 24, 1999, QUALCOMM and Ericsson entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement (the "Agreement") for the sale by the Company to Ericsson of certain
assets related to the Company's terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure
business. The Company and Ericsson also entered into various license and
settlement agreements in connection therewith, all of which are effective upon
the closing of the sale (the "Closing"). The Closing is subject to certain
customary closing conditions. The Closing is expected to occur during the
Company's third fiscal quarter of 1999. Under the Agreement, (a) QUALCOMM agreed
to sell certain assets relating to its terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure
business to Ericsson in exchange for cash and the assumption of certain
liabilities, (b) QUALCOMM and Ericsson agreed to jointly support a single
worldwide CDMA standard with three optional modes for the next generation of
wireless communications and (c) all of the existing litigation between the
companies will be settled and the companies will enter into royalty-bearing
cross-licenses for their respective CDMA patent portfolios.



                                       17

    Pursuant to the Agreement, Ericsson will purchase certain assets of
QUALCOMM's terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business, including its R&D
resources, located in San Diego, Calif. and Boulder, Colo., and will assume
selected customer commitments, including a portion of future vendor financing
obligations, related assets and personnel. The Company recorded a charge of $60
million to reflect the difference between the carrying value of the net assets
and the consideration to be received from Ericsson, less costs to sell. As part
of the Agreement, the Company agreed to jointly finance with Ericsson certain
sales by Ericsson of cdmaOne and cdma2000 infrastructure equipment and services
(the "cdmaOne/2000 Sales").

    Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company will extend up to $400 million in
financing for possible future sales by Ericsson of cdmaOne or cdma2000
infrastructure equipment and related services to specific customers in certain
geographic areas, including Brazil, Chile, Russia, and Mexico, or in other areas
selected by Ericsson. Such commitments are subject to the customers meeting
certain conditions established in the financing arrangements and, in most cases
to Ericsson also financing a portion of such cdmaOne or cdma2000 sales.
Commitments represent the estimated amounts to be financed under these
arrangements, however, actual financing may be in lesser amounts.

    Effective upon the closing, the Agreement will settle the litigation between
Ericsson and QUALCOMM and provide for cross-licensing of patents for all CDMA
technologies, including cdmaOne, WCDMA and cdma2000. The cross-licenses are
royalty bearing for CDMA subscriber units sold by Ericsson and QUALCOMM.
QUALCOMM also will receive rights to sublicense certain Ericsson patents,
including the patents asserted in the litigation, to QUALCOMM's Application
Specific Integrated Circuits ("ASIC") customers.

    The Company expects to incur additional charges in the third quarter of
fiscal 1999 relating to the disposition of the terrestrial CDMA wireless
infrastructure business. The Company currently estimates these charges to be
approximately $100 million, primarily related to compensation for employees
being transferred to Ericsson in connection with the proposed sale of the
Company's terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business. This estimate is
largely based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock, and
therefore is subject to market fluctuations.

    As part of the Agreement, QUALCOMM and Ericsson have also agreed to jointly
support approval by the International Telecommunications Union ("ITU") and the
other standards bodies, including the U.S. Telecommunications Industry
Association ("TIA") and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
("ETSI"), of a single CDMA third generation ("3G") standard that encompasses
three optional modes of operation: 1) direct sequence Frequency Division Duplex
("FDD"), 2) multi-carrier FDD, and 3) Time Division Duplex ("TDD"). Each mode
supports operation with both GSM MAP and ANSI-41 networks. The Company believes
that rapid adoption of the single CDMA standard is in the best interests of the
industry and will allow each operator to select which mode of operation to
deploy based on marketplace needs. As part of the Agreements, QUALCOMM and
Ericsson will each commit to the ITU and to other standards bodies to license
their essential patents for the single CDMA standard or any of its modes to the
rest of the industry on a fair and reasonable basis free from unfair
discrimination. Upon the Closing, each of the companies have agreed to notify
the ITU and other relevant standards bodies that any intellectual property
rights blocking currently in force will be immediately withdrawn.

    There can be no assurance that the Closing will occur or that the
transactions contemplated under the Agreement will be consummated. There can be
no assurance that the industry or any country will adopt such a single CDMA
standard or that such a standard, if adopted, will be commercially deployed. The
extent to which it is commercially deployed may have a material affect on the
Company. The Company believes that its CDMA patent portfolio provides broad
coverage and is applicable to any commercially viable CDMA wireless system,
including modes of CDMA recommended for the proposed single CDMA 3G standard.
The Company has informed standards bodies, including the ITU, TIA, ETSI and the
Association of Radio Industries and Business ("ARIB"), that it holds essential
patents for third generation CDMA systems that have been submitted to such
standards bodies. Further, the Company intends to vigorously enforce and protect
its intellectual property position against any infringement. However, despite
the Company's position and the license agreements entered into by the Company
with Ericsson and others which provide for royalties payable to the Company for
certain products employing such CDMA standards, there can be no assurance that
the Company's CDMA patents will be determined to be applicable to any proposed
standard. The adoption of next generation CDMA standards, if any, which are
determined not to rely on the



                                       18
<PAGE>   19
Company's intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's business, results of operations, liquidity and financial position.

    Upon consummation of the transaction with Ericsson, the Company will retain
certain terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business contracts. Equipment
sales and deployment services under these contracts may be subcontracted to
Ericsson. The Company will no longer develop terrestrial infrastructure
products. Accordingly, the Company reassessed the recoverability of the carrying
value of remaining assets relating to its terrestrial CDMA wireless
infrastructure business.

    The Company had intended to transfer its equity ownership interest in
Telesystems of Ukraine ("TOU") to Leap Wireless International ("Leap Wireless").
During March 1999, the Company reassessed the recoverability of its ownership
interest in TOU and its working capital receivable from TOU ("TOU assets") in
light of recent developments affecting the TOU business and the disposition of
other assets related to the terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business.
As a result, the Company recorded a $15 million non-operating charge to write
off the TOU assets, as well as a $12 million charge to operations to write off
other assets related to the TOU contract.

    The Company recorded a charge of $21 million during the second quarter to
reduce the carrying value of certain other assets to their approximate net
realizable value, including the $12 million in other assets related to the TOU
contract. The Company also recorded $52 million in non-operating charges,
including $37 million in reserves provided for financial guarantees on projects
which the Company will no longer pursue as a result of the Ericsson transaction
and $15 million related to the write-off of TOU assets.

SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 1998

    Total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 were $932 million, an
increase of $171 million or 22% compared to total revenues of $761 million for
the second quarter of fiscal 1998. Revenue growth was primarily due to the
significant growth in the revenue related to communications systems.

    Communications systems revenues were $774 million in the second quarter of
fiscal 1999, an increase of $148 million or 24% compared to $626 million for the
same period in fiscal 1998. The increase represents the higher volume of sales
of CDMA subscriber and ASICs products.

    Contract services revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 were $81
million, a 25% increase compared to $65 million for the same period in fiscal
1998. The dollar increase resulted primarily from revenues from the development
agreement with Globalstar.



                                       20

    License, royalty and development fees for the second quarter of fiscal 1999
were $77 million, compared with revenues of $70 million for the same period in
fiscal 1998. In the second quarter of 1999, shipments of CDMA equipment by
licensees increased, resulting in increased royalty payments due to the Company.
The increase in royalties was partially offset by a decline in up-front license
payments. License, royalty and development fees may continue to fluctuate
quarterly due to the timing and amount of up-front fees on new licenses,
royalties from sales by the Company's licensees and changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 1998, the Company
began to accrue its estimate of certain royalty revenues earned that previously
could not be reasonably estimated prior to being reported by its licensees.

    Costs of communications systems were $568 million or 73% of communications
systems revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to $485 million
or 78% of communications systems revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1998.
Costs of communications systems for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 include
$10 million in non-recurring charges primarily related to additional
infrastructure equipment contract costs to be incurred as a result of the
Company's decision to sell its terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure
business. Costs of communications systems as a percentage of communications
systems revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 decreased primarily as a
result of cost improvements related to ASICs products. Communications systems
costs as a percentage of communications systems revenues may fluctuate in future
quarters depending on mix of products sold, competitive pricing, new product
introduction costs and other factors.

    Contract services costs for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 were $55
million or 68% of contract services revenues, compared to $49 million or 76% of
contract services revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1998. The dollar
increase in contract services costs was primarily related to increased sales
under the Globalstar development contract. Contract service costs as a
percentage of contract services revenue decreased due to a change in the mix of
labor and materials incurred on the Globalstar development contract.

    Research and development expenses were $103 million or 11% of revenues for
the second quarter of fiscal 1999, compared to $77 million or 10% of revenues
for the same period in fiscal 1998.

    Selling and marketing expenses were $54 million or 6% of revenues for the
second quarter of fiscal 1999, compared to $60 million or 8% of revenues for the
same period in fiscal 1998. The dollar decline in selling and marketing expense
was due primarily to a decrease in marketing expense for infrastructure
products, including reduced headcount and proposal activity.

    General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 1999
were $51 million or 5% of revenues, compared to $38 million or 5% of revenues
for the second quarter of fiscal 1998. The dollar increase was attributable to
growth in personnel and associated overhead expenses necessary to support the
overall growth in the Company's operations and increased legal, patent, and
information technology expenses.

    Other operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal 1999 were $96
million. During the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a pretax
restructuring charge to operations of $15 million. The restructuring charge was
comprised of employee termination benefits and facility exit costs resulting
primarily from the Company's plan to exit certain activities in its
infrastructure business. In March 1999, the Company entered into the Agreement
with Ericsson to sell certain assets related to its terrestrial CDMA wireless
infrastructure business and various license and settlement agreements in
connection therewith. As a result, the Company recorded charges of $60 million
to reflect the difference between the carrying value of the net assets to be
sold and the consideration to be received, less costs to sell, and $21 million
to reduce the carrying value of certain other assets relating to its terrestrial
CDMA wireless infrastructure business.

    Interest income was $8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1999,
compared to $10 million for the same period in fiscal 1998 due to lower cash and
investment balances.

    Interest expense was $5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1999,
compared to $2 million for the same period in fiscal 1998. The higher interest
expense is due to higher average balances on the bank lines of credit.



                                       21
<PAGE>   22
    During the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a loss of $3
million in connection with the cancellation of warrants to purchase 1,000,000
common shares of Leap Wireless. The cancellation was done to give further
assurance that Leap Wireless will meet the FCC criteria for designated entity
status.

    During the second quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded $52 million
in non-operating charges, including $37 million in reserves provided for
financial guarantees on projects which the Company will no longer pursue as a
result of the Ericsson transaction and $15 million related to the write-off of
TOU assets.

    Distributions on Trust Convertible Preferred Securities of $10 million for
the second quarter of fiscal 1999 and 1998 relate to the private placement of
$660 million of 5 3/4% Trust Convertible Preferred Securities by QUALCOMM in
February 1997.

    The minority interest represents other parties' or stockholders' share of
the income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries, including QPE, a joint
venture with a subsidiary of Sony. The minority interest for the second quarter
of 1998 includes the impact of restructuring QPE.

    The second quarter loss resulted in an income tax benefit of $23 million for
the second quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to an income tax expense of $0.2
million for the same period in fiscal 1998. The annual effective tax rate for
fiscal 1999 is currently estimated to be 35%, excluding the effect of the
reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, compared to 30% for fiscal 1998, excluding
an increase in certain estimated tax credits.

FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 1998

    Total revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1999 were $1,874 million,
an increase of $328 million or 21% over total revenues of $1,546 million for the
first six months of fiscal 1999.

    Communications systems revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1999 were
$1,591 million, a 22% increase compared to revenues of $1,302 million for the
same period in fiscal 1998. The increase for the first six months of fiscal 1999
represents the higher volumes of sales of CDMA subscriber and ASICs products,
increased revenues from the expansion of the installed OmniTRACS base in the
U.S., and sales of commercial gateways for deployment in the Globalstar system.

    Contract services revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1999 increased
to $161 million from $129 million for the same period in fiscal 1998, an
increase of 25%. The increase of $32 million resulted primarily from the
development agreement with Globalstar.

    License, royalty and development fees for the first six months of fiscal
1999 were $121 million, compared to $115 million for the same period in fiscal
1998, an increase of 5%. The increase was driven by increased royalties
recognized in conjunction with the worldwide sales of subscriber units utilizing
the Company's CDMA technology by the Company's licensees, partially offset by
lower up front license fees. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 1998,
the Company began to accrue its estimate of certain royalty revenues earned that
previously could not be reasonably estimated prior to being reported by its
licensees.

    Costs of communications systems for the first six months of fiscal 1999 were
$1,153 million or 72% of communications systems revenues, compared to $993
million or 76% of communications systems revenues for the same period in fiscal
1998. The dollar increase in costs primarily reflects increased shipments of
CDMA subscriber and ASICs products, and sales of commercial gateways.
Communications systems costs as a percentage of communications systems revenues
decreased primarily as a result of cost improvements related to ASICs products.
Communications systems costs as a percentage of communications systems revenues
may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold,
competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors.

    Contract services costs for the first six months of fiscal 1999 were $113
million or 70% of contract services revenues, compared to $95 million or 74% of
contract services revenues for the same period in fiscal 1998. The dollar
increase in contract services costs was primarily related to the Globalstar
development contract. Contract

service costs as a percentage of contract services revenue decreased due to a
change in the mix of labor and materials incurred on the Globalstar development
contract.

    For the first six months of fiscal 1999, research and development expenses
were $203 million or 11 % of revenues, compared to $152 million or 10% of
revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1998.

    For the first six months of fiscal 1999, selling and marketing expenses were
$123 million or 7% of revenues, compared to $116 million or 7% of revenues for
the same period in fiscal 1998.

    General and administrative expenses for the first six months of fiscal 1999
were $102 million or 5% of revenues, compared to $75 million or 5% of revenues
for the same period in fiscal 1998. The dollar increase for the first six months
of fiscal year 1999 was attributable to continued growth in personnel and
associated overhead expenses necessary to support the overall growth in the
Company's operations, increased litigation, patent and information technology
expenses.

    During the first six months of fiscal 1999, other operating expenses were
$96 million, compared to $12 million for the same period in fiscal 1998. During
the first six months of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a pretax restructuring
charge to operations of $15 million. The restructuring charge was comprised of
employee termination benefits and facility exit costs resulting primarily from
the Company's plan to exit certain activities in its infrastructure business. In
March 1999, the Company entered into the Agreement with Ericsson to sell certain
assets related to its terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business, and
various license and settlement agreements in connection therewith. As a result,
the Company recorded charges of $60 million to reflect the difference between
the carrying value of the net assets to be sold and the consideration to be
received, less costs to sell, and $21 million to reduce the carrying value of
certain other assets relating to its terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure
business and various license and settlement agreements in connection therewith.

    During the first six months of fiscal 1998, the Company acquired, for $10
million, substantially all of the assets of Now Software, Inc. In connection
with this asset purchase, acquired in-process research and development of $7
million, representing the fair value of software products still in the
development stage that had not yet reached technological feasibility, was
expensed at the acquisition date. This expense was included in other operating
expenses. Also during the same period, the Company recorded a $5 million
non-cash charge to operations relating to the impairment of leased manufacturing
equipment that is no longer used in the manufacturing process. The $5 million
charge represented the estimated total cost of related lease obligations, net of
estimated recoveries.

    For the first six months of fiscal 1999, interest income was $14 million
compared to $22 million for the same period in fiscal 1998. The higher interest
income for the first six months of fiscal 1998 was related to the interest
earned on the proceeds from the private placement of Trust Convertible Preferred
Securities which occurred during February 1997.

    For the first six months of fiscal 1999, interest expense was $9 million
compared to $4 million for the same period in fiscal 1998, as a result of the
interest charged on the higher average balances on the bank lines of credit.

    During the first six months of fiscal 1999, the Company recognized a gain of
$6 million on the sale of available-for-sale securities, as compared to a net
gain of $3 million during the same period in fiscal 1998, from the sale of, and
other investing activities related to, investments in other entities.

    During the first six months of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded a loss of
$3 million in connection with the cancellation of warrants to purchase 1,000,000
common shares of Leap Wireless. The cancellation was done to give further
assurance that Leap Wireless will meet the FCC criteria for designated entity
status.

    During the first six months of fiscal 1999, the Company recorded $52 million
in non-operating charges, including $37 million in reserves provided for
financial guarantees on projects which the Company will no longer pursue as a
result of the Ericsson transaction and $15 million related to the write off of
TOU assets.

    Distributions on Trust Convertible Preferred Securities of $20 million for
the first six months of fiscal 1999 and 1998 relate to the private placement of
$660 million of 5 3/4% Trust Convertible Preferred Securities by QUALCOMM in
February 1997.

    The minority interest represents other parties' or stockholders' share of
the income or losses of consolidated subsidiaries, including QPE, a joint
venture with a subsidiary of Sony.

    Income tax expense was $0.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 1999
compared to $20 million for the same period in fiscal 1998, resulting primarily
from the non-recurring charges for the first six months of fiscal 1999. The
income tax expense for the first six months of fiscal 1999 reflects the benefit
for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit retroactive to July 1, 1998. The
annual effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 is currently estimated to be 35%,
excluding the effect of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, compared to 30%
for fiscal 1998, excluding an increase in certain estimated tax credits.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

    The Company anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents and investments
balances of $205 million at March 28, 1999, including interest earned thereon,
will be used to fund working and fixed capital requirements, financing for
customers of its CDMA infrastructure products and investment in joint ventures
or other companies and other assets to support the growth of its business. The
Company contemplates raising additional funds from a combination of sources
including potential debt and equity issuances. There can be no assurance that
additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In
addition, the Company's Credit Facilities as well as notes and indentures, place
restrictions on the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness which
could adversely affect its ability to raise additional capital through debt
financing.

    The Company has two unsecured credit facilities ("Credit Facilities") under
which banks are committed to make up to $400 million and $200 million in
revolving loans to the Company. The Credit Facilities expire in March 2001 and
2000, respectively. The $400 million facility may be extended on an annual basis
upon maturity. At the Company's option, amounts outstanding under the $200
million facility may be converted to a one year term loan with a final maturity
of March 2001. The Company is currently obligated to pay commitment fees equal
to 0.2% per annum on the unused amount of the Credit Facilities. The Credit
Facilities include certain restrictive financial and operating covenants. At
March 28, 1999, there were $8 million letters of credit issued, and no amounts
outstanding, under the Credit Facilities.

    In the first six months of fiscal 1999, $23 million in cash was provided by
operating activities, compared to the use of $61 million for operating
activities the first six months of fiscal 1998. Cash used by operating
activities in the first six months of fiscal 1999 and 1998 includes $221 million
and $223 million, respectively, of net working capital requirements offset by
$244 million and $162 million, respectively, of net cash flow provided by
operations. Net working capital requirements of $221 million during the first
six months of fiscal 1999 primarily reflect increases in accounts receivable and
finance receivables and reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
offset by a decrease in inventories. The increase in accounts receivable and
finance receivables, and the decrease in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, during the first six months of fiscal 1999 primarily reflects the
continued growth in products and component sales. The reduction in total
inventory is primarily the result of inventory management programs.

    The Company has entered into strategic alliance agreements to support the
design and manufacture of CDMA infrastructure products. In one of these
agreements, in which QUALCOMM participates on a percentage basis with the prime
contractor, outstanding finance receivables of $20 million from the prime
contractor are being withheld subject to the end-customer's complete acceptance
of the total system. There is currently a dispute between the prime contractor
and the end-customer as to the contract language of the acceptance criteria. The
Company believes it has met its obligations and is entitled to payment under the
contract. The Company may be exposed to the extent the prime contractor is not
successful in obtaining the customer's acceptance or negotiates a reduced
payment.

    Investments in capital expenditures, intangible assets and other entities
totaled $105 million in the first six months of fiscal 1999, compared to $170
million in the same period of fiscal 1998. Significant components in the first
six months of fiscal 1999 consisted of the purchase of $95 million of capital
assets, and the investment of $10 million in newly formed development stage
entities. The Company expects to continue making investments in capital assets
throughout fiscal 1999.

    In the first six months of fiscal 1999, the Company's financing activities
provided $17 million. The Company and QPE repaid net amounts of $80 million and
$7 million, respectively, on their outstanding credit facilities, and the
Company realized $106 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock
under the Company's stock option and employee stock purchase plans. In the first
six months of fiscal 1998, the Company's financing activities used net cash of
$30 million. The first six months of fiscal 1998 included $25 million from the
issuance of common stock under the Company's stock option and employee stock
purchase plans, offset by $54 million in net repayments on outstanding bank
lines of credit.

    During March 1998, the Company agreed to defer up to $100 million of
contract payments, with interest accruing at 5-3/4% capitalized quarterly, as
customer financing under its development contract with Globalstar. Financed
amounts outstanding as of January 1, 2000, will be repaid in eight equal
quarterly installments commencing as of that date, with final payment due
October 1, 2001, accompanied by all then unpaid accrued interest. At March 28,
1999, of approximately $105 million in interest bearing financed amounts and
approximately $246 million in accounts receivable, including $80 million not yet
billed, were outstanding from Globalstar.

    At March 28, 1999, commitments to extend long-term financing for possible
future sales to customers totaled approximately $276 million through fiscal
2003. Such commitments are subject to the customers meeting certain conditions
established in the financing arrangements. Commitments represent the estimated
amounts to be financed under these arrangements; actual financing may be in
lesser amounts. Pursuant to the Ericsson Agreement, the Company will extend up
to $400 million in financing for possible future sales by Ericsson. Commitments
outstanding at March 28, 1999 will be included in the $400 million.

    The Company has committed to provide a guarantee of a working capital bank
loan of $100 million to its customer, Pegaso Telecommunicaciones, S.A. de C.V.
("Pegaso"), to facilitate its network launch and purchase of equipment from the
Company. In April 1999, the Company provided a $10 million working capital loan
to Pegaso repayable within 30 days.

    The Company has issued a letter of credit to support a guarantee of up to
$22.5 million of Globalstar borrowings under an existing bank financing
agreement. The guarantee will expire in December 2000. The letter of credit is
collateralized by a commensurate amount of the Company's investments in debt
securities. As of March 28, 1999, Globalstar had no borrowings outstanding under
the existing bank financing agreement.

    As part of the Company's strategy of supporting the commercialization and
sale of its CDMA technology and products, the Company may from time to time
enter into strategic alliances with domestic and international emerging wireless
telecommunications operating companies. These alliances often involve the
investment by QUALCOMM of substantial equity in the operating company. At March
28, 1999, the Company has investments in Shinsegi Telecomm, Inc. (Korea) and
Canbra Holdings, S. A. (Brazil).

    Canbra Holdings, S. A., a consortium comprised of Bell Canada International
Inc. (34.4%), QUALCOMM Incorporated (16.2%), SLI Wireless S.A. (12.5%), Taquari
Participaoes S.A. (2.5%) and WLL International (34.4%), announced on January 15,
1999 that it has won an operating license to provide wireless and wireline
telephone services in the northeast region of Brazil. QUALCOMM invested $2.4
million during the second quarter of fiscal 1999 and expects to make additional
equity contributions over the next three years in amounts approximating $46
million.

    A second consortium comprised of Bell Canada International Inc. (35.3%),
QUALCOMM Incorporated (16.6%), SLI Wireless S.A. (12.8%), and WLL International
(34.3%) announced on April 23, 1999 that it has won an operating license to
provide wireless and wireline telephone services in the Sao Paulo State of
Brazil. QUALCOMM will invest approximately $8 million over the next two years
related to its interest in the consortium.



                                       25

    In November 1998, the Company and Microsoft Corporation entered into a joint
venture agreement pursuant to which each company obtained a 50% ownership
interest in a newly formed development stage entity, Wireless Knowledge LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company. Wireless Knowledge intends to form strategic
partnerships with computing, software and telecommunications companies, as well
as with wireless carriers, for the purpose of enabling secure and
airlink-independent internet access to mobile users. Pursuant to the joint
venture agreement, QUALCOMM made a capital contribution of $7.5 million during
the first quarter of fiscal 1999 and will be required to provide an additional
$17.5 million in equity contributions through June 2000.

    QUALCOMM has a substantial funding commitment to Leap Wireless in the form
of a $265 million secured credit facility. The credit facility consists of two
sub-facilities. The first sub-facility enables Leap Wireless to borrow up to
$35.2 million from QUALCOMM, solely to meet the normal working capital and
operating expenses of Leap Wireless, including salaries, overhead and credit
facility fees, but excluding, among other things, strategic capital investments
in wireless operators, substantial acquisitions of capital products, and/or the
acquisition of telecommunications licenses. The other sub-facility enables Leap
Wireless to borrow up to $229.8 million from QUALCOMM, solely to use as
investment capital to make certain identified portfolio investments. Amounts
borrowed under the credit facility will be due on September 23, 2006. QUALCOMM
will have a first priority security interest in, subject to minor exceptions,
substantially all of the assets of Leap Wireless for so long as any amounts are
outstanding under the credit facility. Amounts borrowed under the credit
facility will bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus 5.25% per
annum. Interest will be payable quarterly beginning September 30, 2001; and
prior to such time, accrued interest shall be added to the principal amount
outstanding. At March 28, 1999, $45.2 million was outstanding under this
facility.

YEAR 2000 READINESS

    The Year 2000 ("Y2K") issue relates to the way computer systems and programs
define calendar dates. A system could fail or miscalculate a date including "00"
to mean 1900 rather than 2000. Also, other systems and products that are not
typically recognized as computer or information technology related may contain
embedded hardware or software that would be affected by this issue.

    The Company has been working on correcting Y2K problems since 1997. As part
of this strategy, a Y2K Program Office was formed consisting of a Program
Director and key individuals. In February 1999, the Company reorganized the
Program Office and it is now led by the Company's Chief Information Officer
("CIO"). It is sponsored by each division President and is composed of Senior IT
Managers / Directors within each division. These leaders are responsible for
working within their divisions to ensure Y2K readiness with a primary focus on
products and customers. Functional areas which support all divisions are also
members of the Program Office. These include Supply Chain, Corporate Human
Resources and Accounting, Logistics, Facilities, and certain elements of
Information Technology. All Program Office members are focusing attention and
required resources on the Company's Y2K issues. The Company has also engaged
outside consulting firms to assist with the effort. All Y2K efforts are being
tracked through the Program Office though plans have been developed and are
being executed at the division and functional area levels. This strategy is
expected to reduce the Company's level of uncertainty about the Y2K problem, and
in particular, about the Y2K readiness of the Company's critical customers and
suppliers. The Company believes that with the completion of the Project as
scheduled, the possibility of significant interruptions of normal operations
will be reduced.

    As of March 28, 1999, the Company's Y2K Project ("Project"), designed to
minimize the impact of Y2K problems on operations, is proceeding on the revised
schedule. However, the Company is unable to completely determine at this time
whether the consequences of Y2K failures will have a material impact on the
Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial condition. The failure
to correct a material Y2K problem could result in an interruption in, or a
failure of, certain normal business activities or operations. Such failures
could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations,
liquidity and financial condition. This is due to the general uncertainty
inherent in the Y2K problems, resulting in part from the uncertainty of the Y2K
readiness of third-party suppliers, customers and utility services. 

    The members of the Company's Y2K Program Office are addressing the issues
under four major sections: Internal Readiness, Supply Chain Assessment, Product
Readiness and Customer Readiness. Each section is evaluated



                                       26
<PAGE>   27
through four phases: Discovery, Assessment, Remediation and Post-Remediation.
Discovery is the process of identifying potential Y2K issues throughout the
Company's critical business process. Assessment is the process of categorizing
issues that were identified in the Discovery phase into "ready," "not ready" or
"needs more study." Remediation is the process of fixing and testing those items
that must be ready for the Y2K. Post-Remediation is the process of addressing
Y2K issues that were not previously or not adequately corrected.

    Internal Readiness addresses the computing and communications
infrastructure, the tools and systems used to develop products and run the
business, and internal service organizations. The Company has identified the
majority of the critical systems and non-computer related items that are
required to be Y2K ready. Using supplier data and internal discovery methods,
remediation or replacement efforts have begun. Those items considered most
critical to continuing operations are given the highest priority, and testing on
these items is scheduled to be complete by October 1999. The Company has
established a dedicated Y2K readiness testing lab for testing the Company's
computing and communications infrastructure as well as the Company's critical
business tools. The majority of non-ready critical systems are scheduled to be
retired, replaced, or repaired by October 1999. At this time, no critical issues
have been identified that will not be made ready by calendar year-end 1999.

    Supply Chain Assessment involves evaluating the Y2K readiness of QUALCOMM's
suppliers and their ability to continue delivering materials and services after
1999. The Company has initiated formal communications with critical suppliers to
determine the Company's vulnerability to suppliers' Y2K issues. The Company has
requested that critical suppliers represent their products and services to be
Y2K ready and that they have a program to test for that readiness. The Company
has received initial Y2K readiness information from the majority of critical
suppliers. On-site visits of key suppliers for the purpose of verifying Y2K
readiness status are being conducted during the first two calendar quarters of
1999. Based on knowledge gained through communication with critical suppliers
and in parallel with the supplier assessment process, the Company is developing
contingency plans to ensure minimal interruption of supply. The Company is
scheduled to assess the majority of its critical suppliers' state-of-readiness
for Y2K by June 30, 1999. If the Company determines a critical supplier is not
on track to be Y2K ready, the Company will solidify contingency plans relevant
to those suppliers, while in parallel initiating a search for alternate
solutions to avoid supply chain interruptions. At this time, no critical
suppliers have been identified as not being Y2K ready, however, the assessment
is not complete. In addition, the Company is participating in the High
Technology Consortium - Year 2000 and Beyond, and leveraging that organization
and resource pool to augment the Company's efforts.

    Product Readiness includes the review of QUALCOMM's products for Y2K
readiness. The Company's program office has been working with individual
business unit managers to review all QUALCOMM products for Y2K readiness. The
Company believes the majority of its products are Y2K ready with further formal
verification being initiated where required. The majority of testing for Y2K
product readiness is scheduled for completion by September 1999. The Company
expects to verify Y2K readiness for the majority of products and to have an 
upgrade or migration path available for legacy products by November 1999.

    Customer Readiness is the review of QUALCOMM's major customers for Y2K
readiness. The Program Office has organized a review targeted to cover a
significant portion of the Company's customers. Customer lists are being
generated and survey work has begun. The Company does not currently have
sufficient information concerning the Y2K readiness status of major customers.
The Company is requesting information from customers to understand their state
of Y2K readiness and has scheduled this process for completion by September
1999.

    While the Company expects these efforts will provide reasonable assurance
that material disruptions will not occur due to internal failure, the potential
for interruption still exists. The need for a contingency plan is recognized and
plans will be developed to deal with issues such as "at risk" suppliers and
interruption of utility and other services. The response of certain third
parties is beyond the control of the Company. If the Company does not receive
adequate Y2K readiness responses from its critical suppliers or customers prior
to June 1999, contingency plans will be developed by September 1999. Contingency
plans may include increasing inventory levels, securing alternate sources of
supply, adjusting alternate shutdown and start-up schedules and other
appropriate measures. At this time, the Company cannot estimate the additional
cost, if any, from the implementation of such contingency plans.



                                       27
<PAGE>   28
    The Company believes its critical systems will be Y2K ready by October 1999.
However, there is no guarantee that these results will be achieved. Specific
factors contributing to this uncertainty include failure to identify all
susceptible systems, non-readiness by third parties whose systems and operations
impact the Company and other similar uncertainties. A worst case scenario might
include one or more of the Company's internal systems, suppliers, products or
customers not being Y2K ready. An event such as this could result in a material
disruption to the Company's operations. Specifically, the Company could
experience software application, computer network, manufacturing products and
telephone system failures. Supply chain and product non-readiness could result
in the failure of the Company to perform on contracts, delayed delivery of
products to customers and inadequate customer service. Customer non-readiness
could result in delayed payments for products and services and build up of
inventories. Should a worst case scenario occur, it could, depending on its
duration, have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of
operations, liquidity and financial position.

    To date the Company has spent an estimated $10 million on this Project.
Total budgeted cost at this time is estimated at $28 million. The funding for
this Project comes from operations and working capital. The Company does not
have a project tracking system that tracks the cost and time that its employees
spend on the Y2K project. However, the Company estimates the allocable time of
employees using average hourly rates for each class of employee. None of the
Company's other mission critical information projects have been delayed due to
the implementation of the Y2K Project.

FUTURE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS

    In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131 ("FAS 131"), "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information," which the Company will be required to adopt for fiscal year 1999.
This statement establishes standards for reporting information about operating
segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information about
operating segments in interim financial reports issued to shareholders. It also
establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas and major customers. Under FAS 131, operating segments are to
be determined consistent with the way that management organizes and evaluates
financial information internally for making operating decisions and assessing
performance. The Company has not completed its determination of the impact of
the adoption of this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial
statement disclosures.

    In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133 ("FAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities," which the Company will be required to adopt for fiscal year 2000.
This statement establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and
hedging activities. Under FAS 133, all derivatives must be recognized as assets
and liabilities and measured at fair value. The Company has not completed its
determination of the impact of the adoption of this new accounting standard on
its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

MARKET RISK

    A complete discussion and analysis of the Company's market risks is
described in the Company's 1998 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such risks include
unfavorable movements in interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency
exchange rates. In regard to foreign exchange risk, foreign exchange financial
instruments that are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations which may
affect reported earnings include financial instruments which are not denominated
in the currency of the legal entity holding the instruments. Such risk exists in
connection with both equity investees and wholly-owned subsidiaries. Because of
the rapid ramp up in operations during the first six months of fiscal 1999 by
the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, QUALCOMM do Brazil (QdB), accounts
payable and receivable not denominated in the currency of QdB have increased
dramatically since September 27, 1998. QdB uses the local currency, the
Brazilian real, as its functional currency. During the second quarter of fiscal
1999, a significant devaluation occurred in the Brazilian real. As a result, the
Company recorded a $29 million translation loss in equity. The Company also
recorded a $2 million transaction gain which affected earnings as a result of
local currency denominated price protection agreements. At March 28, 1999, the
Company has $1 million in net payables at QdB which are not denominated in the
local currency. The fair value of those net payables would increase by $0.1
million if the U.S. dollar were to depreciate against the Brazilian real by 10%.
This hypothetical amount is suggestive of the effect on fair value, but not on
future cash flows assuming that the Company does not



                                       28
<PAGE>   29
sell QdB. At March 28, 1999, there have been no other material changes to the
market risks described at September 27, 1998. Additionally, the Company does not
anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of its market risk exposures or
in management's objectives and strategies with respect to managing such
exposures.

            SECTION 2.02. Assumption and Exclusion of Liabilities. (a) On the

<PAGE>   20
                                       15


            (iv)  all Liabilities for accounts payable for goods and services

            SECTION 2.03. Purchase Price. Subject to the adjustments set forth

Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Assets and the assumption of the Assumed

the Closing takes place being the "CLOSING DATE").

            SECTION 2.05. Closing Deliveries by the Seller. At the Closing, the
Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser:

            (a)   one or more Bills of Sale and such other instruments, in form

            (b)   an executed counterpart of one or more Assumption Agreements,

                                       16


            (b)   an executed counterpart of one or more Assumption Agreements,
the ASICS Supply Agreements, the Infrastructure Supply Agreement, the Interim
Services Agreement, the Lease Agreements and the Vendor Financing Agreement; and

            (c)   the opinions, certificates and other documents required to be
delivered pursuant to Section 7.01.

            SECTION 2.07. Pre-Closing Adjustment of the Purchase Price. The
Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment as specified in this Section 2.07:

            (a)   January Statement of Net Assets. The Seller has prepared and
delivered to the Purchaser an audited schedule of specified assets and
liabilities of the Acquired Business as of the close of business on January 24,
1999 (the "JANUARY STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS"), which the Seller represents was
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
preparation of the Annual Financial Statements and the Interim Financial
Statements, reflecting only the book value of the Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities (as the same shall exist as of January 24, 1999) and eliminating the
book value of the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities (as the same
shall exist as of January 24, 1999), together with a report thereon of the
Seller's Accountants stating that the January Statement of Net Assets fairly
presents the financial position of the Acquired Business as of January 24, 1999
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The specified net assets of the Acquired Business
as of January 24, 1999 (the "JANUARY NET BOOK VALUE") shall be calculated as the
excess of the book value of the Assets as of January 24, 1999 over the book
value of the Assumed Liabilities as of January 24, 1999.

            (b)   Disputes. (i) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.07(b),
the January Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser
shall be deemed to be and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto.

            (ii)  The Purchaser may dispute any amounts reflected on the January

      Statement of Net Assets to the extent the net effect of such disputed
      amounts in the aggregate would affect the January Net Book Value reflected
      on the January Statement of Net Assets by more than [*] (the "ADJUSTMENT
      THRESHOLD"), but only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the
      January Statement of Net Assets were not arrived at in accordance with
      U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Annual
      Financial Statements and Interim Financial Statements or that the amounts
      reflected thereon do not properly adjust to include only the book value of
      the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and to eliminate the book value of
      the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, that
      the Purchaser shall have notified the Seller and the Seller's Accountants
      in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute
      and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the basis


* Confidential Treatment Requested
<PAGE>   22
                                       17



      for such dispute, within 15 Business Days of the date hereof. In the event
      of such a dispute, the Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's
      Accountants shall attempt to reconcile their differences, and any
      resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
      conclusive on the parties hereto. If any such resolution by the
      Purchaser's Accountants and the Seller's Accountants leaves in dispute
      amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate would not affect the
      January Net Book Value reflected on the January Statement of Net Assets by
      more than the Adjustment Threshold, all such amounts remaining in dispute
      shall then be deemed to have been resolved in favor of the January
      Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser. If the
      Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants are unable to reach a
      resolution with such effect within ten Business Days after receipt by the
      Seller and the Seller's Accountants of the Purchaser's written notice of
      dispute, the Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants shall
      submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to an independent
      accounting firm of international reputation mutually acceptable to the
      Purchaser and the Seller (such accounting firm being referred to herein as
      the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM"), which shall, within ten Business Days
      after such submission, determine and report to the Purchaser and the
      Seller upon such remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final,
      binding and conclusive on the Seller and the Purchaser. The fees and
      disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated
      between the Seller and the Purchaser in the same proportion that the
      aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted to the
      Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such
      party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to
      the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted.

            (iii) In acting under this Agreement, the Purchaser's Accountants,
      the Seller's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
      entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

            (c)   Purchase Price Adjustment. The January Statement of Net Assets
shall be deemed final for the purposes of this Section 2.07 upon the earlier of
(A) the failure of the Purchaser to notify the Seller of a dispute within 15
Business Days of the date hereof, (B) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant
to Section 2.07(b)(ii), by the Purchaser's Accountants and the Seller's
Accountants and (C) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section
2.07(b)(ii), by the Independent Accounting Firm. Prior to the Closing, a
Purchase Price adjustment shall be made as follows:

            (i)   in the event that the January Net Book Value reflected on the
      final January Statement of Net Assets exceeds the January Net Book Value
      reflected on the January Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller
      to the Purchaser by at least the Adjustment Threshold, then the Purchase
      Price shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal to such excess over the
      Adjustment Threshold; and

<PAGE>   23
                                       18


            (ii)  in the event that the January Net Book Value reflected on the
      January Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser
      exceeds the January Book Value reflected on the final January Statement of
      Net Assets by at least the Adjustment Threshold, then the Purchase Price
      shall be adjusted downward in an amount equal to such excess over the
      Adjustment Threshold.

            (d)   If the January Statement of Net Assets is not deemed final in
accordance with Section 2.07(c) on or prior to the Closing, (i) the Purchase
Price shall be [*], and (ii) the Purchase Price shall be further adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.07(c) as soon as the January Statement of Net Assets is
deemed final in accordance with Section 2.07(c), with the Seller or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, making a cash payment to the other to reflect
such adjustment, by wire transfer in immediately available funds.

            SECTION 2.08. Post-Closing Adjustment of the Purchase Price. The
Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing as specified in
this Section 2.08:

            (a)   Closing Statement Of Net Assets. As promptly as practicable,
but in any event within 45 calendar days following the Closing Date, the Seller
shall at its expense prepare and deliver to the Purchaser an audited schedule of
specified assets and liabilities of the Acquired Business as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the "CLOSING STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS") prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of
the January Statement of Net Assets (except that it shall include an appropriate
reserve for deferred costs or deferred revenues from vendor financing contracts,
if appropriate under U.S. GAAP), reflecting only the book value of the Assets
and the Assumed Liabilities (as the same shall exist as of the Closing) and
eliminating the book value of the Excluded Assets and the Excluded Liabilities
(as the same shall exist as of the Closing), together with (i) a report thereon
of the Seller's Accountants stating that the January Statement of Net Assets
fairly presents the financial position of the Acquired Business at the Closing
Date in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and (ii) a certification of the chief
financial officer or chief accounting officer of the Seller to the effect that
the Closing Statement of Net Assets has been prepared in compliance with the
requirements of this Section 2.08. The specified net assets of the Acquired
Business as of the Closing (the "CLOSING NET BOOK VALUE") shall be calculated as
the excess of the book value of the Assets reflected on the Closing Statement of
Net Assets over the book value of the Assumed Liabilities reflected on the
Closing Statement of Net Assets.

            (b)   Disputes. (i) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.08(b),
the Closing Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser
shall be deemed to be and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
hereto.

            (ii)  The Purchaser may dispute any amounts reflected on the Closing
      Statement of Net Assets to the extent the net effect of such disputed
      amounts in the aggregate would affect the Closing Net Book Value reflected
      on the Closing Statement of Net Assets by more than the Adjustment
      Threshold, but only on the basis that the amounts reflected on the Closing
      Statement of Net Assets were not arrived at in accordance with U.S. GAAP
      applied on a basis consistent with the preparation of the January
      Statement of Net Assets or that the amounts reflected thereon do not
      properly adjust to include only the book value of the Assets and the
      Assumed Liabilities and to eliminate the book value of the Excluded Assets
      and the Excluded Liabilities; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall
      have notified the Seller and the Seller's Accountants in writing of each
      disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting forth,
      in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 15 Business Days
      of the Seller's delivery of the Closing Statement of Net Assets to the
      Purchaser. In the event of such a dispute, the Seller's Accountants and
      the Purchaser's Accountants shall attempt to reconcile their differences,
      and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final,
      binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If any such resolution by
      the Purchaser's Accountants and the Seller's Accountants leaves in dispute
      amounts the net effect of which in the aggregate would not affect the
      Closing Net Book Value reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets by
      more than the Adjustment Threshold, all such amounts remaining in dispute
      shall then be deemed to have been resolved in favor of the Closing
      Statement of Net Assets delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser. If the
      Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants are unable to reach a
      resolution with such effect within ten Business Days after receipt by the
      Purchaser and the Purchaser's Accountants of the Seller's written notice
      of dispute, the Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's Accountants shall
      submit the items remaining in dispute for resolution to the Independent
      Accounting Firm, which shall, within ten Business Days after such
      submission, determine and report to the Purchaser and the Seller upon such
      remaining disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and
      conclusive on the Seller and the Purchaser. The fees and disbursements of
      the Independent Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Seller and
      the Purchaser in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such
      remaining disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm
      that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined
      by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such
      remaining disputed items so submitted.

            (iii) In acting under this Agreement, the Purchaser's Accountants,
      the Seller's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
      entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

            (iv)  No adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
      2.08(c) shall be made with respect to amounts disputed by the Purchaser
      pursuant to this Section 

<PAGE>   25
                                       20


      2.08(b), unless the net effect of the amounts successfully disputed by the
      Purchaser in the aggregate is to decrease the Closing Net Book Value
      reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets by at least the
      Adjustment Threshold, in which case such adjustment shall only be made in
      an amount equal to any excess over the Adjustment Threshold.

            (c)   Purchase Price Adjustment. The Closing Statement of Net Assets
shall be deemed final for the purposes of this Section 2.08 upon the earlier of
(A) the failure of the Purchaser to notify the Seller of a dispute within 15
Business Days of the Seller's delivery of the Closing Statement of Net Assets to
the Purchaser, (B) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section
2.08(b)(ii), by the Purchaser's and the Seller's Accountants and (C) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.08(b)(ii), by the Independent
Accounting Firm. Subject to the limitation set forth in Section 2.08(b)(iv),
within three Business Days of the Closing Statement of Net Assets being deemed
final, a Purchase Price adjustment shall be made as follows:

            (i)   in the event that the January Net Book Value reflected on the
      final January Statement of Net Assets exceeds the Closing Net Book Value
      by at least the Adjustment Threshold, then the Purchase Price shall be
      adjusted downward in an amount equal to such excess over the Adjustment
      Threshold, and the Seller shall, within three Business Days of such
      determination, pay such amount, together with interest thereon, from the
      Closing Date through the date of payment at the rate of interest publicly
      announced by Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto in New York, New York
      from time to time as its reference rate from the Closing Date to the date
      of such payment, to the Purchaser by wire transfer in immediately
      available funds; and

            (ii)  in the event that the Closing Net Book Value exceeds the
      January Net Book Value reflected on the final January Statement of Net
      Assets by at least the Adjustment Threshold, then the Purchase Price shall
      be adjusted upward in an amount equal to such excess over the Adjustment
      Threshold and the Purchaser shall, within three Business Days of such
      determination, pay the amount of such excess together with interest
      thereon, from the Closing Date through the date of payment at the rate of
      interest publicly announced by Citibank, N.A. or any successor thereto in
      New York, New York from time to time as its reference rate from the
      Closing Date to the date of such payment, to the Seller by wire transfer
      in immediately available funds.

            SECTION 2.09. Allocation of the Purchase Price. The sum of the
Purchase Price and the Assumed Liabilities shall be allocated among the Assets
as of the Closing Date in accordance with Exhibit 2.09. Any subsequent
adjustments to the sum of the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities shall be
reflected in the allocation hereunder in a manner consistent 

<PAGE>   26
                                       21


with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1060-1T(f). For all Tax purposes, the
Purchaser and the Seller agree to report the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement in a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including the
allocation under Exhibit 2.09, and that neither of them will take any position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax return, in any refund claim, in any
litigation, or otherwise without the consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

            SECTION 3.04. Financial Information. Section 3.04 of the Disclosure
Schedule contains true and complete copies of (i) the unaudited statements of

held on consignment. The Seller is not under any obligation or liability with

            (c)   The Business Intellectual Property and the Intellectual

Business Intellectual Property or upon the rights of the Seller therein.

            (g)   Except as set forth in Section 3.02(c) of the Disclosure

programs or arrangements, and all employment, termination, severance or other
contracts or agreements, whether legally enforceable or not, to which the Seller

enforceable or not, (i) to create, incur liability with respect to or cause to
exist any other employee benefit plan, program or arrangement, (ii) to enter

multiemployer plan (within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)
(a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN") or a single employer pension plan (within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Seller could incur liability
under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN"). None of the
Plans is subject to Title IV of ERISA. None of the Plans provides for the
payment of separation, severance, termination or similar-type benefits to any
Person or obligates the Seller to pay separation, severance, termination or
similar-type benefits solely as a result of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements or as a result of a "change in the
ownership or effective control" or a "change in the ownership of a substantial
portion of the assets" of the Seller, within the meaning of such term under
Section 280G of the Code. None of the Plans provides for or promises retiree
medical, retiree disability or retiree life insurance benefits to any current or
former employee, officer or director of the Seller. Each of the Plans is subject
only to the laws of the United States or a political subdivision thereof.

"fiduciaries" (within the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) have always acted
in material compliance with the provisions of all applicable Laws, including,
without limitation, ERISA and the Code. The Seller has performed all material
obligations required to be performed by it under, is not in any material respect
in default under or in violation of, and has no knowledge of any material
default or violation by any party to, any Plan. No Action is pending or
threatened with respect to any Plan (other than claims for 

<PAGE>   41
                                       36


benefits in the ordinary course) and no fact or event exists that could give
rise to any such Action.

            (d)   Qualification of Certain Plans. Each Plan which is intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified
and each trust established in connection with any Plan which is intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code has
received a determination letter from the IRS that it is so exempt, and, to the
knowledge of the Seller, no fact or event has occurred since the date of such
determination letter from the IRS to adversely affect the qualified status of
any such Plan or the exempt status of any such trust. Each trust maintained or
contributed to by the Seller which is intended to be qualified as a voluntary
employees' beneficiary association and which is intended to be exempt from
federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS that it is so qualified and so
exempt, and, to the knowledge of the Seller, no fact or event has occurred since
the date of such determination by the IRS to adversely affect such qualified or
exempt status.

            (e)   Absence of Certain Liabilities and Events. There has been no
material prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 or 407 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to any Plan. The Seller has not
incurred any material liability for any excise tax arising under Section 4971,
4972, 4980 or 4980B of the Code and no fact or event exists which could give
rise to any such liability. The Seller has not incurred any liability under,
arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary
course), including, without limitation, any liability in connection with (i) the
termination or reorganization of any employee benefit plan subject to Title IV
of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan, and no fact or event exists which could give rise to any such liability.

            (f)   Plan Contributions and Funding. All contributions, premiums or
payments required to be made with respect to any Plan have been made on or
before their due dates. All such contributions have been fully deducted for
income tax purposes and no such deduction has been challenged or disallowed by
any Governmental Authority and, to the knowledge of the Seller, no fact or event
exists which could give rise to any such challenge or disallowance.

            (g)   Warn Act. The Seller is in compliance with the requirements of
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act ("WARN") and has no
liabilities pursuant to WARN.

and the Ancillary Agreements by the Purchaser do not and will not (a) violate,
conflict with or result in the breach of any provision of the charter or by-laws

            SECTION 4.03. Governmental Consents and Approvals. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which
it is a party by the Purchaser do not and will not require any consent,
approval, authorization or other order of, action by, filing with, or
notification to, any Governmental Authority, except (a) the notification
requirements of the HSR Act and (b) where the failure to obtain such consent,
approval, authorization or order would not prevent or materially delay

Ancillary Agreements.

investigation is pending or, to the best knowledge of the Purchaser, threatened

                                       41


            SECTION 5.01. Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing. The Seller

or contemplated by this Agreement or the License Agreements, (iv) as may be
necessary or appropriate to carry out the transactions contemplated by this

Acquired Business' current relationships with its customers, suppliers and other
persons with which it has significant business relationships; and (iv) use its
reasonable best efforts to not engage in any practice, take any action, fail to
take any action or enter into any transaction which could reasonably be expected
to cause any representation or warranty of the Seller to be untrue or result in
a breach of any covenant made by the Seller in this Agreement. The Seller
covenants and agrees that, prior to the Closing, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, the Seller will not (x) do any of the things
enumerated in the second sentence of Section 3.16 or (y) enter into any new
Material Contract. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Seller may enter
into contracts relating to Brazil Regions 1 and 3 without the Purchaser's
consent, provided, however, that such contracts shall not become Transferred
Customer Contracts unless the Purchaser has consented thereto, and if the
Purchaser does not so consent, the infrastructure equipment required thereunder
shall be manufactured and supplied by a third party and not by the Seller.

            SECTION 5.02. Access to Information. (a) From the date hereof until
the Closing, upon reasonable notice, the Seller shall and shall cause each of
the Seller's officers, employees, agents, accountants and counsel to: (i) afford
the officers, employees and authorized agents, accountants, counsel and
representatives of the Purchaser reasonable access, during normal business
hours, to the offices, properties, plants, other facilities, books and records
of the Acquired Business and to those officers, employees, agents, accountants
and counsel of the Seller who have any knowledge relating to the Acquired
Business and (ii) furnish to the officers, employees and authorized agents,
accountants, counsel and representatives of the Purchaser such additional
financial and operating data and other information regarding the Acquired
Business as the Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request.

            (b)   In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made
against or incurred by the Seller prior to or following the Closing, for a
period of seven years after the

<PAGE>   47
                                       42


            Closing, the Purchaser shall (i) retain the books and records of the
Seller which are transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement
relating to periods prior to or following the Closing in a manner reasonably
consistent with the prior practices of the Seller and (ii) upon reasonable
notice, afford the officers, employees, authorized agents, accountants, counsel
and representatives of the Seller reasonable access (including the right to make
photocopies at the Seller's expense), during normal business hours, to such
books and records.

            (c)   In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made by or
against or incurred by the Purchaser after the Closing, for a period of seven
years following the Closing, the Seller shall (i) retain all books and records
of the Seller which are not transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement and which relate to the Acquired Business for periods prior to the
Closing and which shall not otherwise have been delivered to the Purchaser and
(ii) upon reasonable notice, afford the officers, employees, authorized agents,
accountants, counsel and representatives of the Purchaser, reasonable access
(including the right to make photocopies at the Purchaser's expense), during
normal business hours, to such books and records.

            SECTION 5.03. Confidentiality. (a) The Seller agrees to, and shall
cause its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors
to: (i) treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to
any Person to) all information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent or
trademark applications, product development, price, customer and supplier lists,
pricing and marketing plans, policies and strategies, operations methods,
product development techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel
acquisition plans and any other confidential information with respect to the
Acquired Business, (ii) in the event that the Seller or any such agent,
representative, Affiliate, employee, officer or director becomes legally
compelled to disclose any such information, provide the Purchaser with prompt
written notice of such requirement so that the Purchaser may seek a protective
order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Section 5.03, (iii) in the
event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the
Purchaser waives compliance with this Section 5.03, furnish only that portion of
such confidential information which is legally required to be provided and
exercise its reasonable best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information, and (iv) promptly furnish (prior
to, at, or as soon as practicable following, the Closing) to the Purchaser any
and all copies (in whatever form or medium) of all such confidential information
then in the possession of the Seller or any of its agents, representatives,
Affiliates, employees, officers and directors and destroy any and all additional
copies then in the possession of the Seller or any of its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors of such
information and of any analyses, compilations, studies or other documents
prepared, in whole or in part, on the basis thereof; provided, however, that
this sentence shall not apply to any information that, at the time of
disclosure, is available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this
Agreement by the Seller, its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees,
officers or directors; provided further that specific information shall not be
deemed to be within the foregoing exception

<PAGE>   48
                                       43


merely because it is embraced in general disclosures in the public domain. In
addition, any combination of features shall not be deemed to be within the
foregoing exception merely because the individual features are in the public
domain unless the combination itself and its principle of operation are in the
public domain.

            (b)   The Purchaser agrees to, and shall cause its agents,
representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to: (i) treat and
hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access to any Person to) all
information relating to trade secrets, processes, patent or trademark
applications, product development, price, customer and supplier lists, pricing
and marketing plans, policies and strategies, operations methods, product
development techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition
plans and any other confidential information obtained by the Purchaser pursuant
to the Confidentiality Agreement and not related to the Acquired Business, (ii)
in the event that the Purchaser or any such agent, representative, Affiliate,
employee, officer or director becomes legally compelled to disclose any such
information, provide the Seller with prompt written notice of such requirement
so that the Seller may seek a protective order or other remedy or waive
compliance with this Section 5.03, (iii) in the event that such protective order
or other remedy is not obtained, or the Seller waives compliance with this
Section 5.03, furnish only that portion of such confidential information which
is legally required to be provided and exercise its reasonable best efforts to
obtain assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded such information,
and (iv) promptly furnish (prior to, at, or as soon as practicable following,
the Closing) to the Seller any and all copies (in whatever form or medium) of
all such confidential information then in the possession of the Purchaser or any
of its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors
and destroy any and all additional copies then in the possession of the
Purchaser or any of its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers
and directors of such information and of any analyses, compilations, studies or
other documents prepared, in whole or in part, on the basis thereof; provided,
however, that this sentence shall not apply to any information that, at the time
of disclosure, is available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this
Agreement by the Purchaser, its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees,
officers or directors; provided further that specific information shall not be
deemed to be within the foregoing exception merely because it is embraced in
general disclosures in the public domain. In addition, any combination of
features shall not be deemed to be within the foregoing exception merely because
the individual features are in the public domain unless the combination itself
and its principle of operation are in the public domain.

            (c)   Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees and acknowledges
that remedies at Law for any breach of its obligations under this Section 5.03
are inadequate and that in addition thereto a party shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of
any such breach, without the necessity of demonstrating the inadequacy of money
damages.

                                       44


            (d)   Upon consummation of the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate without any further action on the part of the
Purchaser or the Seller.

            SECTION 5.04. Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and
Consents. (a) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of all
Governmental Authorities and officials that may be or become necessary for its
execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate fully with the
other party in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals. Each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing, if
necessary, pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, but in any event within ten
Business Days of the date hereof, and to supply as promptly as practicable to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act.

            (b)   The Seller shall give promptly such notices to third parties
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all such third party consents that
are necessary or desirable in connection with the transfer of the Material
Contracts. The Purchaser shall cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to
assist the Seller in giving such notices and obtaining such consents; provided,
however, that the Purchaser shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or
other consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice or consent
or to consent to any change in the terms of any Material Contract which the
Purchaser in its sole discretion may deem adverse to the interests of the
Purchaser or the Acquired Business.

            (c)   The Seller and the Purchaser agree that, in the event any
consent, approval or authorization necessary or desirable to preserve for the
Acquired Business or the Purchaser any right or benefit under any lease,
license, contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement to which the
Seller is a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, the Seller will,
subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with the Purchaser in attempting to obtain
such consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable.
If such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, the Seller will
use its reasonable best efforts to provide the Purchaser with the rights and
benefits of the affected lease, license, contract, commitment or other agreement
or arrangement for the term of such lease, license, contract or other agreement
or arrangement, and, if the Seller provides such rights and benefits, the
Purchaser shall assume the obligations and burdens thereunder.

            (d)   The Seller and the Purchaser agree to cooperate with each
other (i) in providing to the Purchaser, on commercially reasonable terms and
for purposes of conducting the Acquired Business, the benefit of any asset or
right that is currently used in the Acquired Business and that is not
effectively transferred to the Purchaser under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements and (ii) in providing to the Seller, on commercially reasonable terms
and for purposes of conducting the businesses of the Seller as of the date

            Acquired Business, the benefit of any asset or right that is
currently used in such businesses and that is transferred to the Purchaser under
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

            (e)   The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate in preparing a
comprehensive list prior to the Closing of all Permits that are non-transferable
or which will require the consent of any Governmental Authority in order to be
transferred to the Purchaser in the event of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            SECTION 5.05. Notice of Developments. (a) Prior to the Closing, the
Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser in writing of (i) all events,
circumstances, facts and occurrences arising subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which could reasonably be expected to result in any material breach of
a representation or warranty or covenant of the Seller in this Agreement or
which could reasonably be expected to have the effect of making any
representation or warranty of the Seller in this Agreement untrue or incorrect
in any material respect and (ii) all other material adverse developments
affecting the Assets, Liabilities, business, financial condition, operations,
results of operations, customer or supplier relations, employee relations,
projections or prospects of the Seller or the Business.

            (b)   Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser shall promptly notify the
Seller in writing of all events, circumstances, facts and occurrences arising
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which could reasonably be expected to
result in any material breach of a representation or warranty or covenant of the
Purchaser in this Agreement or which could reasonably be expected to have the
effect of making any representation or warranty of the Purchaser in this
Agreement untrue or incorrect in any material respect.

            SECTION 5.06. No Solicitation or Negotiation. The Seller agrees that
between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (i) the Closing and (ii)
the termination of this Agreement, neither the Seller nor any of its respective
Affiliates, officers, directors, representatives or agents will (a) solicit,
initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or offers from any
Person relating to any acquisition or purchase of all or any portion of the
Assets or the Acquired Business (other than (i) Inventory to be sold in the
ordinary course of the Business consistent with past practice and (ii) proposals
or offers related to the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets
or capital stock of the Seller in a transaction subject to the prior rights of
the Purchaser under this Agreement related to the acquisition of the Assets and
the Acquired Business), or (b) participate in any discussions, conversations,
negotiations or other communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person
any information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or
participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other
Person to seek to do any of the foregoing. The Seller immediately shall cease
and cause to be terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations
and other communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to
any of the foregoing. Subject to confidentiality agreements binding upon the
Seller as of the date hereof, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser promptly if
any such

<PAGE>   51
                                       46


proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect
thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to the Purchaser, indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or contact and the material terms and conditions of such proposal,
offer, inquiry or other contact. The Seller agrees not to, without the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, release any Person from, or waive any
provision of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Seller is
a party and which is primarily related to a potential acquisition of all or any
portion of the Assets or the Acquired Business, and the Seller agrees to send,
promptly after the date of this Agreement, requests to all parties under such
agreements to return or destroy confidential information obtained from the
Seller thereunder related to the Assets or the Business.

            SECTION 5.07. Use of Intellectual Property. (a) Except as reasonably
necessary for the Seller to commercially exploit the Excluded Assets or to
fulfill its obligations under the Excluded Liabilities and Excluded Contracts,
from and after the Closing, the Seller shall not use any of the Business
Intellectual Property (other than software not customized for the Acquired
Business), other than as contemplated pursuant to the Ancillary Agreements. The
Purchaser hereby grants to the Seller a perpetual, royalty-free license to use
such Business Intellectual Property as it exists at the Closing Date to
commercially exploit the Excluded Assets and to fulfill its obligations under
the Excluded Liabilities and Excluded Contracts.

            (b)   The Seller shall not use or put into use after the Closing any
materials that bear any trademark, service mark, trade dress, logo or trade name
contained in the Business Intellectual Property transferred to the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement or any trademark, service mark, trade dress, logo or
trade name similar or related thereto.

            (c)   After the Closing, the Purchaser shall not use any advertising
or promotional materials or other paper goods or supplies that state or
otherwise indicate thereon that the Acquired Business is a division or unit of
the Seller; provided, that to the extent that any such materials or supplies
included in the Assets so indicate, the Purchaser may use such materials and
supplies for a period of six months after the Closing Date.

discharge the Excluded Liabilities as and when the same become due and payable.

            SECTION 5.10. Bulk Transfer Laws. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges
that the Seller has not taken, and does not intend to take, any action required
to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws or similar laws,
and the Purchaser hereby waives compliance by the Seller with any applicable
bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the sale
of the Assets to the Purchaser (other than any obligations with respect to the
application of the proceeds herefrom). Pursuant to Article VIII, the Seller has
agreed to indemnify the Purchaser against any and all liabilities which may be
asserted by third parties (including with respect to Taxes) against the
Purchaser as a result of the Seller's noncompliance with any such law.

            SECTION 5.11. Tax Matters. (a) The Seller agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless the Purchaser against any loss, damage, liability or expense,
including reasonable fees for attorneys and other outside consultants, incurred
in contesting or otherwise in connection with Taxes imposed on the Seller or the
Acquired Business with respect to taxable periods or portions thereof ending on

<PAGE>   54
                                       49


applicable estimated or final tax return required to be filed by the Purchaser
on which is required to be reported income for a period ending after the Closing
Date for which the Seller is responsible under Section 5.11(a) without regard to
whether the tax return shows overall net income or loss for such period, and
(ii) within three Business Days following an agreement between the Seller and
the Purchaser that an indemnity amount is payable, an assessment of a Tax by a
taxing authority, or a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the
Code. If liability under this Section 5.11 is in respect of costs or expenses
other than Taxes, payment by the Seller of any amounts due under this Section
5.11 shall be made within five Business Days after the date when the Seller has
been notified by the Purchaser that the Seller has a liability for a
determinable amount under this Section 5.11 and is provided with calculations or
other materials supporting such liability.

            (c)   The Seller and the Purchaser shall share equally any real
property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer,
and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration, and other fees, and any
similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The Seller, after
review and consent by the Purchaser, shall file such applications and documents
as shall permit any such Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing
Date in accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedure. The Purchaser
shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable
the Seller to comply with the foregoing. The Purchaser shall complete and
execute a resale or other exemption certificate with respect to the inventory
items sold hereunder, and shall provide the Seller with an executed copy
thereof. The Seller shall provide to the Purchaser such information regarding
the location of tangible property of the Acquired Business sufficient to support
the filing of complete and accurate Tax returns and reports by the Purchaser.

            (d)   At the request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall file with
all applicable Tax authorities any statements, certificates or forms provided
for under federal, state, local or foreign Tax laws to prevent the Purchaser
from being liable as a transferee for Taxes of the Seller.

            (e)   The Seller and the Purchaser agree to treat all payments made
by either to or for the benefit of the other under this Section 5.11 and any
other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any misrepresentations or
breach of warranties or covenants, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof except to the
extent that the laws of a particular jurisdiction provide otherwise, in which
case such payments shall be made in an amount sufficient to indemnify the
relevant party on an after-Tax basis.

            (f)   The Seller shall, on or before September 30, 1999, provide to
the Purchaser such information and substantiating documentation, as required
under Section 41(f)(3) of the Code, regarding "qualified research expense" and
"gross receipts" of the

Acquired Business for purposes of computing the credit for increasing research
activities under Section 41 of the Code.

            SECTION 5.12. Letters of Credit, Etc. (a) Set forth on Section 5.12
of the Disclosure Schedule is a true and complete list of all letters of credit,
performance bonds and similar obligations arising under any Transferred Customer
Contracts. The Purchaser shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the Seller to
be released, as of or as promptly as practicable following the Closing, from all
such letters of credit, performance bond and similar obligations (whether
through the provision of a replacement letter of credit, guaranty or otherwise).

            (b)   The Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to cause the
Purchaser to receive the benefits following the Closing of all letters of
credit, performance bonds and similar obligations that have been issued in favor
of or for the benefit of the Seller under any Transferred Customer Contracts
(whether through the assignment thereof, the issuance of a replacement letter of
credit, guaranty or otherwise).

            SECTION 5.13. License of Excluded Intellectual Property. The Seller
hereby grants to the Purchaser a perpetual, exclusive (subject to license
agreements existing as of the date hereof) royalty-free license to use the
Intellectual Property described in clause (D) of the definition of Excluded
Intellectual Property as it exists at the Closing Date in the conduct of the
Acquired Business.

            SECTION 5.14. Ancillary Agreements. The parties shall cooperate in
good faith to prepare, negotiate and finalize the Ancillary Agreements as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event the parties cooperate in good
faith but are nevertheless unable to finalize any Ancillary Agreement by the
time otherwise scheduled for the Closing, the term sheet attached hereto which
sets forth the principal terms of such Ancillary Agreement shall be binding on
the parties and shall govern the relationship of the parties following the
Closing with respect to the matters covered thereby until such time as the
parties shall execute and deliver the applicable Ancillary Agreement.

            SECTION 5.15. Other Matters. (a) The Purchaser agrees that San Diego
shall be the Purchaser's principal research and development center for IS-95 and
CDMA 2000 applications for the foreseeable future.

            (b)   The Seller shall, to the extent and in the manner it deems
commercially reasonable, cause wireless system operators in which it has an
existing equity investment to purchase their IS-95 and CDMA 2000 infrastructure
products from the Purchaser if the Purchaser offers products competitive as to
quality and price with other products then available in the market.

                                       51


            (c)   The Purchaser agrees to actively promote and support
IS-95-based products, to the extent and in the manner it deems commercially
reasonable. The Purchaser represents to the Seller that it will exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to sell IS-95 equipment under the Transferred
Customer Contracts.

            (d)   The Purchaser and the Seller each agree to actively promote
the high data rate project currently under development by the Seller as each
deems commercially reasonable.

            SECTION 5.16. Provision of Subscriber Units. In order for the
Purchaser to comply with its obligations to provide subscriber units under the
Transferred Customer Contracts with US West Wireless LLC and Mauritius Telecom
Limited, the Seller shall, if the Purchaser so requests, sell subscriber units
to the Purchaser in the quantities required by such Transferred Customer
Contracts and on the other terms set forth therein, [*].

            SECTION 5.17. Joint Support of Third Generation Standard. The Seller
and the Purchaser hereby agree to jointly support approval by the International
Telecommunications Union (the "ITU") and other standards bodies, including the
U.S. Telecommunications Industry Association and the European Telecommunication
Standards Institute, of a single CDMA third generation standard that encompasses
three optional modes of operation: (i) direct sequence FDD, (2) multi-carrier
FDD and (3) TDD (the "SINGLE CDMA STANDARD"). Each mode supports operation with
both GSM MAP and ANSI-41 networks. The Seller and the Purchaser believe that
rapid adoption of the Single CDMA Standard is in the best interests of the
industry and allows each operator to select which mode of operation to deploy
based on marketplace needs. The Seller and the Purchaser shall commit to the ITU
and to other standards bodies to license their essential patents for the single
CDMA Standard or any of its modes on a fair and reasonable basis free from
unfair discrimination. Accordingly, both parties shall, on the Closing Date,
notify the ITU and other relevant standards bodies that any intellectual
property rights blocking currently in force will be immediately withdrawn.

            SECTION 5.18. Further Action. Each of the parties hereto shall use
all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
Laws, and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as may be
required to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without
limitation, delivering, or causing to be delivered, the certificates, opinions
and other documents to be delivered to the other party as a condition to such
other party's obligations under Article VII of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                EMPLOYEE MATTERS

            SECTION 6.01. Offer of Employment. Section 6.01 of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of the Business Employees as of the date of this
Agreement. On or prior to the 30th calendar day after the date of this
Agreement, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a list of Business
Employees to which it intends to extend an offer of employment (the "SELECTED
BUSINESS EMPLOYEES"), [*]. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall offer to
employ on an "at-will" basis and subject to the Purchaser's standard terms,
conditions and policies of employment, each of the Selected Business Employees
on the same basis (i.e., full- or part-time) as such Selected Business Employees
were employed by the Seller immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that any Selected Business Employee who is on vacation at the Closing
Date shall be offered employment only if his return date is within 30 days of
the Closing Date; provided, further, however, that any Selected Business
Employee who is on short-term disability or on an approved leave of absence
shall be offered employment hereunder upon the employee obtaining a medical
release or other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser which
evidences the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of his
regular work, with or without reasonable accommodation, and the employee returns
to active employment with the Purchaser (i) if on short-term disability or on an
approved leave of absence under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended
("FMLA"), no later than the last day on which the employee may return to work
under the provisions of the applicable Seller short-term disability plan or
FMLA, or (ii) for all other approved leaves of absence, within 30 days of the
Closing Date. Those Selected Business Employees who accept such offers prior to
the Closing Date shall become employees of the Purchaser as of the Closing Date,
or, for individuals on leave, as of their return from leave as described in the
previous sentence (the "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES"). The Purchaser shall be
responsible for obtaining any necessary visas for Transferred Employees.

            SECTION 6.02. Transferred Employee Liabilities. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Purchaser shall assume all employer or employment related
obligations to the Transferred Employees arising after the Closing Date. The
Seller shall retain, and the Purchaser shall not assume, all obligations (i)
relating to any Business Employees who do not become Transferred Business
Employees and (ii) relating to any Business Employees arising on or prior to the
Closing Date.

            SECTION 6.03. Participation in Certain Retirement Plans. All
Transferred Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser's CAP &
Savings Plan and the Purchaser's defined benefit pension plan as of the Closing
Date, or, for individuals on leave as of the Closing Date, as of the date such
individuals become Transferred Employees in

                                       53


accordance with Section 6.01, and service credit under such plans shall be
provided pursuant to Section 6.06.

            SECTION 6.04. Executive Plan. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall have established a separate non-qualified deferred compensation
plan (the "PURCHASER'S DCP") providing for the payment of deferred benefits to
the executives of the Business who are Transferred Employees who have previously
deferred income under the terms of the Seller's Voluntary Executive Retirement
Contribution Plan (the "SELLER'S DCP"). On the Closing Date, the Seller shall
transfer the benefit obligations to Transferred Employees under Seller's DCP to
Purchaser's DCP and shall transfer the assets in any trusts established to fund
the Seller's obligations under the Seller's DCP to trusts established for this
purpose by the Purchaser. The Purchaser's DCP shall contain substantially
identical provisions to the Seller's DCP, provided that (i) the Purchaser shall
not be obligated to provide identical investment opportunities to participants
and (ii) the Purchaser's DCP shall be maintained on a frozen basis after the
Closing Date (i.e., no further participant deferrals or employer matching
contributions shall be permitted). The Purchaser agrees that it shall honor the
terms of the distribution elections previously made by Transferred Employees who
are participants in the Seller's DCP. The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold the
Seller harmless in respect of all obligations to pay benefits under the Seller's
DCP that have been transferred to the Purchaser under the Purchaser's DCP.

            SECTION 6.05. Welfare Benefit Plans. (a) Benefits related to any
Transferred Employee or an eligible dependent under any Seller-sponsored welfare
benefit plan in which the employee or eligible dependent participated prior to
the Closing Date shall cease as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that
liabilities relating to claims of Transferred Employees or eligible dependents
for medical benefits incurred for medical services rendered to, and purchases of
prescription drugs and other health care products made by, such persons while
actively employed by the Seller (or while an eligible dependent of such a
person) shall be retained by the Seller (including but not limited to the cost
of hospitalization and any related charges for any such person hospitalized
before the Closing Date and who remains continuously hospitalized after the
Closing Date, until such persons's date of discharge from the hospital). The
Purchaser agrees to recognize any deductibles and co-payments paid by
Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents under the Seller's welfare
benefit plans in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs toward any
applicable calendar year deductibles and co-payments under the Purchaser's
welfare benefit plans.

            (b)   All Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents who
are participating in the Seller's welfare benefit plans on the Closing Date
shall become participants in the Purchaser's welfare benefit plans on the
Closing Date. The Purchaser agrees to waive any pre-existing medical condition
restrictions and similar restrictions contained in the Purchaser's welfare
benefit plans. The Purchaser further agrees to permit all dependents of
Transferred Employees who were participating in any Seller-sponsored welfare
benefit plan on 

<PAGE>   59
                                       54


the Closing Date to participate in the Purchaser's welfare benefit plans on the
Closing Date, regardless of whether such dependents are currently eligible to
participate in the Purchaser's welfare benefit plans under their terms of
dependent eligibility. The eligibility of all other dependents of Transferred
Employees to participate in the Purchaser's welfare benefit plans will be
determined in accordance with the dependent eligibility provisions of such
plans. The Purchaser shall, as of the Closing Date, be solely responsible for
the cost of any and all benefits to which Transferred Employees and their
eligible dependents become entitled under the terms of the Purchaser's welfare
benefit plans, as in effect from time to time.

            (c)   The Seller agrees that it shall be and remain liable for
continuing group health benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), for all Business Employees
(and their "qualified beneficiaries" as defined in COBRA) who do not become
Transferred Employees. The Purchaser shall assume all liability under COBRA in
respect of all Transferred Employees, including, without limitation, any COBRA
liability arising as a result of the termination of a Transferred Employee's
employment with the Seller on the Closing Date.

            SECTION 6.06. Service Credit. Transferred Employees shall receive
credit for their service with the Seller or any of its Affiliates (including
service with any predecessor company) for all purposes under the Purchaser's
employee plans, programs and arrangements (other than for purposes of benefit
accrual under the Purchaser's defined benefit pension plans).

            SECTION 6.07. Indemnity. Without limiting in any way the scope of
Article VIII or the applicability of such Article to employment-related and
benefit-related matters, the Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser from any and all claims (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses incurred in defending such claims) against the Purchaser by Transferred
Employees or other Business Employees (including former Business Employees) (i)
that arise from representations made by the Seller to such employees regarding
their future employment, (ii) that pertain to the payment of any bonus or other
incentive compensation accrued or earned by any Transferred Employee prior to
the Closing Date or (iii) that arise from the termination of employment (through
layoff or otherwise) of any Business Employee prior to the Closing Date. The
Seller shall further indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser against any and
all claims against the Purchaser by any Selected Business Employee who does not
accept the Purchaser's offer of employment or who otherwise fails to become a
Transferred Employee.

            SECTION 6.08. Employee Information. No later than 10 calendar days
after the Closing Date, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser the following
information with respect to each Transferred Employee, as applicable:

            (a)   social security number;

<PAGE>   60
                                       55


            (b)   accrued and unused vacation as of the Closing Date;

            (c)   years and months of service as of the Closing Date; and

            (d)   base salary and bonus for the three calendar years immediately
preceding the Closing Date and current base salary.

            SECTION 6.09. Certain Other Employee-Related Costs. Within five
Business Days after the Closing Date, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser
with a complete and accurate statement of any amounts expected to be payable by
the Purchaser following the Closing that relate to any service by any
Transferred Employee with the Seller through the Closing Date, including,
without limitation, any salary or wages, any accrued vacation, sick or personal
days or any bonuses, except to the extent that such amounts will be reflected as
Liabilities on the Closing Statement of Net Assets (the "EMPLOYEE AMOUNTS"). The
Seller shall retain liability for the Employee Amounts and shall pay an amount
of cash to the Purchaser equal to the Employee Amounts within ten Business Days
after the Closing Date.

            (b)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from the Purchaser arising out of or resulting from the causes
enumerated in Section 8.03(a)(i), or in Section 8.03(a)(ii) with respect to
covenants and agreements which by their terms are required to be complied with

            SECTION 8.04. Indemnification Procedures. An indemnified party shall
give the indemnifying party notice of any matter which an indemnified party has
determined has given or could give rise to a right of indemnification under this
Agreement, within 60 days of such determination, stating the amount of the Loss,
if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises. The obligations and Liabilities of the indemnifying party
under this Article VIII with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third
party which are subject to the indemnification provided for in this Article VIII
("THIRD PARTY CLAIMS") shall be governed by and contingent upon the following
additional terms and conditions: if an indemnified party shall receive notice of
any Third Party Claim, the indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party
notice of such Third Party Claim within 30 days of the receipt by the
indemnified party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to provide
such notice shall not release the indemnifying party from any of its obligations
under this Article VIII except to the extent the indemnifying party is
materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the indemnifying
party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to any indemnified
party otherwise than under this Article VIII. If the indemnifying party
acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the indemnified party
hereunder against any Losses (subject to the limitations in Section 8.02(b) or
8.03(b), as appropriate) that may result from such Third Party Claim, then the
indemnifying party shall be entitled to assume and control the defense of such
Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its choice if it gives
notice of its intention to do so to the indemnified party within five days of
the receipt of such notice from the indemnified party; provided, however, that
if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that
would make it inappropriate in the judgment of the indemnified party for the
same counsel to represent both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party,
then the indemnified party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each
jurisdiction for which the indemnified party determines counsel is required, at
the expense of the indemnifying party. In the event the indemnifying party
exercises the right to undertake any such defense against any such Third Party
Claim as provided above, the indemnified party shall cooperate with the
indemnifying party in such defense and make available to the indemnifying party,
at the indemnifying party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials
and information in the indemnified party's possession or

under the indemnified party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required
by the indemnifying party. Similarly, in the event the indemnified party is,
directly or indirectly, conducting the defense against any such Third Party
Claim, the indemnifying party shall cooperate with the indemnified party in such
defense and make available to the indemnified party, at the indemnifying party's
expense, all such witnesses, records, materials and information in the
indemnifying party's possession or under the indemnifying party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the indemnified party. No such
Third Party Claim may be settled by the indemnifying party without the written
consent of the indemnified party, unless such settlement only requires payment
of money damages which will be indemnified.

            SECTION 8.05. Tax Matters. Anything in this Article VIII (except for
the specific reference to Tax matters in Section 8.01) to the contrary
notwithstanding, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
indemnification for any and all Tax matters shall be governed by Section 5.11.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                             TERMINATION AND WAIVER

            SECTION 9.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

            (a)   by the Purchaser if, between the date hereof and the time
scheduled for the Closing: (i) an event or condition occurs that has resulted in
or that could reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect; or
(ii) the Seller makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any
proceeding shall be instituted by or against the Seller seeking to adjudicate it
a bankrupt or insolvent, or seeking liquidation, winding up or reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of its debts under
any Law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization; or

            (b)   by either the Seller or the Purchaser if the Closing shall not
have occurred by July 31, 1999; provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 9.01(b) shall not be available to any party
whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the
cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or
prior to such date; or

            (c)   by either the Purchaser or the Seller in the event that any
Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any
other action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this 

<PAGE>   68
                                       63


Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final
and nonappealable; or

            (d)   by the mutual written consent of the Seller and the Purchaser.

            SECTION 9.02. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of
this Agreement as provided in Section 9.01, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no liability on the part of either party hereto
except (a) as set forth in Section 5.03 and Article X and (b) that nothing
herein shall relieve either party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement.

            SECTION 9.03. Waiver. Either party to this Agreement may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of
the other party contained herein or in any document delivered by the other party
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
of the other party contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound
thereby. Any waiver of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver
of any subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition,
or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this Agreement. The failure of
any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of
any of such rights.


                                    ARTICLE X

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

shall have occurred.

other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be given or made

affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this

discretion of the Seller and the Purchaser); provided, however, that (i) the
Purchaser may assign this Agreement in whole or in part, or any of its rights
hereunder, to an Affiliate of the Purchaser, without the consent of the Seller

rights of employment for any specified period, under or by reason of this
Agreement.

            SECTION 10.09. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended or

                          facility). Related intercreditor arrangements and
                          collateral sharing arrangements shall be mutually
                          agreed to on a case by case basis as to such
                          facilities. As to those financing facilities pursuant

                          QUALCOMM can structure the financing in QUALCOMM's
                          reasonable discretion.

ECONOMIC TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS:               As to those financing facilities pursuant to which
                          QUALCOMM and Ericsson are both providing financing,
                          the economic terms and conditions of such financing
                          shall be mutually agreed to by QUALCOMM and Ericsson

                          terms and conditions for vendor financing transactions
                          of a similar nature. As to those financing facilities
                          pursuant to which only QUALCOMM is providing financing
                          [*], the economic terms and conditions of such 
                          financing shall be in QUALCOMM's reasonable 
                          discretion.

PARI PASSU; 
RISK OF LOSS SHARING:     For any particular project, the Equipment and Services
                          financing provided by QUALCOMM shall rank pari passu
                          with the corresponding financing, if any, provided by
                          Ericsson. The financing shall be structured such that
                          both QUALCOMM and Ericsson shall have immediate
                          concurrent risk of loss (in their relative
                          percentages), without either party having a "first
                          loss" exposure and without either party providing its
                          relative percentage by means of a back-up guaranty or
                          other "make-whole" arrangement.

                                   ARTICLE II

                        AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES

        Section 2.01. The Advances.

        Revolving Credit Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make advances (each a "Revolving Credit
Advance") to the Borrower from time to time on any Business Day during the
period from the Effective Date until the Maturity Date in an aggregate amount
for each such Advance not to exceed such Lender's





                                       19
<PAGE>   25

Unused Revolving Credit Commitment at such time. Each Borrowing shall be in an
aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof and shall consist of Advances of the same Type made on the same day by
the Lenders ratably according to their respective Revolving Credit Commitments.
Within the limits of each Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment, the Borrower may
borrow under this Section 2.01(a), prepay pursuant to Section 2.10 and, until
the Maturity Date, reborrow under this Section 2.01(a).

        Section 2.02. Making the Advances.

        (a) Each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than 10:00
A.M. (San Francisco time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the
proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate
Advances, or the first Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing
in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof
by telecopier or telex. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "Notice of
Borrowing") shall be by telephone, confirmed promptly in writing, or telecopier
or telex, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the
requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances comprising such
Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a
Borrowing consisting of Eurodollar Rate Advances, initial Interest Period for
each such Advance and (v) the Borrower's deposit account into which funds for
such Advance are to be deposited (the "Borrower's Designated Account"). Each
Lender shall, before 11:00 A.M. (San Francisco time) on the date of such
Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to
the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account, in same day
funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing in accordance with the
respective Commitments under the applicable Facility of such Lender and the
other Lenders. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower in the
Borrower's Designated Account selected by the Borrower in the applicable Notice
of Borrowing.

        (b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding,
(i) the Borrower may not select Eurodollar Rate Advances for the initial
Borrowing hereunder (if the initial Borrowing occurs on, or within 3 Business
Days after, the Effective Date) or for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of
such Borrowing is less than $5,000,000 or if the obligation of the Lenders to
make Eurodollar Rate Advances shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08
or 2.12 and (ii) the Eurodollar Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part of
more than 10 separate Borrowings.

        (c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing
specifies is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Borrower shall
indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender
as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such
Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article III, including, without limitation, any actual loss, cost or expense
incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of
such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on
such date.





                                       20
<PAGE>   26

        (d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in
accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Administrative Agent
may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such
date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not
have so made such ratable portion available to the Administrative Agent, such
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until
the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case
of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising
such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If
such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount,
such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and the Borrower's obligation to make
repayment in respect thereof shall terminate.

        (e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as
part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to
be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

        Section 2.03. Reserved.

        Section 2.04. Fees.

        last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a
        duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such
        Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest

        (b) Default Interest. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of

Lenders shall not furnish such timely





                                       22
<PAGE>   28

information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such
interest rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on
the basis of timely information furnished by the remaining Reference Lenders.

for purposes of Section 2.07(a)(i) or (ii), and the rate, if any, furnished by

Section 2.07(a)(ii).

        (b) If, with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Advances, the Required
Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any
Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to each
of such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective
Eurodollar Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent
shall forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon (i) each
Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing
Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance, and (ii) the
obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist.

        (c) If the Borrower shall fail to select the duration of any Interest
Period for any Eurodollar Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions
contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the
Administrative Agent will forthwith so notify the Borrower and the Lenders and
such Advances will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest
Period therefor, Convert into Base Rate Advances.

Eurodollar Rate Advances comprising any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment
or prepayment or otherwise, to less than $5,000,000, such Advances shall
automatically Convert into Base Rate Advances.

        (e) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default under Section 6.01(a), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor,

comprising the same Borrowing into Advances of the other Type; provided,
however, that any Conversion of Eurodollar Rate Advances into Base Rate Advances
shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar
Rate Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be in an amount not less than the minimum amount specified in
Section 2.02(b) and no Conversion of any Advances shall result in more separate
Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice of a
Conversion shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date
of such Conversion, (ii) the Advances to be Converted, and (iii) if such
Conversion is into Eurodollar Rate Advances,





                                       23
<PAGE>   29

the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice
of Conversion shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower.

        Section 2.10. Optional Prepayments.

        The Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' notice in the case
of Eurodollar Rate Advances and one Business Day's notice in the case of Base
Rate Advances, in each case to the Administrative Agent by no later than 10:00
A.M. (San Francisco time) stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay
the outstanding principal amount of the Advances comprising part of the same
Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the
date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that
in the event of any such prepayment of a Eurodollar Rate Advance, the Borrower
shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to
Section 8.04(d). Each such prepayment shall be applied ratably to the principal
installments thereof.

        Section 2.11. Increased Costs.

        (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction (after the date hereof) of or
any change (after the date hereof) in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation or (ii) the compliance (required after the date hereof) with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost to any Lender Party of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Eurodollar Rate Advances (excluding for purposes of this Section 2.11 any such
increased costs resulting from (i) Taxes or Other Taxes (as to which Section
2.14 shall govern) and (ii) changes in the basis of taxation of overall net
income or overall gross income by the United States or by the foreign
jurisdiction or state under the laws of which such Lender Party is organized or
has its Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof), then
the Borrower shall from time to time, promptly upon demand by such Lender Party
(with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party additional amounts
sufficient to compensate such Lender Party for such increased cost; provided,
however, that a Lender Party claiming additional amounts under this Section
2.11(a) agrees to use reasonable efforts (consistent with its internal policy
and legal regulatory restrictions) to designate a different Applicable Lending
Office if the making of such a designation would avoid the need for, or reduce
the amount of, such increased cost that may thereafter accrue and would not, in
the reasonable judgment of such Lender Party, be otherwise disadvantageous to
such Lender Party.

        (b) If any Lender Party determines that compliance with any law or
regulation or any guideline enacted or promulgated after the date hereof or
request after the date hereof from any central bank or other governmental
authority (whether or not having the force of law) affects or would affect the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by such Lender Party or
any corporation controlling such Lender Party and that the amount of such
capital is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender Party's
commitment to lend hereunder and other commitments of such type, then, promptly
upon demand by such Lender Party (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for
the account of such Lender Party, from time to time as specified by such Lender
Party, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender Party or such
corporation in the light of






                                       24
<PAGE>   30


such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender Party reasonably determines
such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of such Lender Party's
commitment to lend hereunder.

        Section 2.12. Illegality.

        Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender
Party shall notify the Administrative Agent that the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful,
or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful,
for any Lender Party or its Eurodollar Lending Office to perform its obligations
hereunder to make Eurodollar Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Eurodollar
Rate Advances hereunder, (i) each Eurodollar Rate Advance will automatically,
upon such demand, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of
the Lender Parties to make, or to Convert Advances into, Eurodollar Rate
Advances shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lender Parties that the circumstances causing such suspension
no longer exist.

        Section 2.13. Payments and Computations.

        (a) The Borrower shall make each payment, without setoff, counterclaim,
recoupment or other deduction, hereunder and under the Notes, if any, not later
than 11:00 A.M. (San Francisco time) on the day when due in U.S. dollars to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent's Account in same day funds.
The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like
funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or commitment fees
ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.14, 2.18, 2.20
or 8.04(d)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable
Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount
payable to any Lender Party to such Lender Party for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Acceptance and
recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to
Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment
and Acceptance, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments hereunder and
under the Notes, if any, in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the
Lender Party assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and
Acceptance shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods
prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

        (b) The Borrower hereby authorizes each Lender Party, if and to the
extent payment owed to such Lender Party is not made when due hereunder or under
the Note, if any, held by such Lender Party, to charge from time to time against
any or all of the Borrower's accounts with such Lender Party any amount so due.

        (c) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate and of fees,
including commitment fees under Section 2.04(a), shall be made by the
Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may
be, and all computations of interest based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal
Funds Rate shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of
360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day
but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest,
fees or commissions are






                                       25
<PAGE>   31

payable. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate, fee
or commission hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

        (d) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes, if any, shall be
stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made
on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such
case be included in the computation of payment of interest or commitment fee, as
the case may be; provided, however, that, if such extension would cause payment
of interest on or principal of Eurodollar Rate Advances to be made in the next
following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding
Business Day.

        (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder
that the Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent
may assume that the Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative
Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount
equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent the Borrower
shall not have so made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each
Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount
distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays
such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

        Section 2.14. Taxes.

        (a) Except as provided in Section 2.14(f), any and all payments by the
Borrower under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any Taxes. In addition, the
Borrower shall pay all Other Taxes.

        (b) Except as provided in Section 2.14(f), if the Borrower shall be
required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes
from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Lender Party or any
Agent, then:

               (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that,
        after making all required deductions and withholdings (including
        deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under
        this Section), such Lender Party or such Agent, as the case may be,
        receives and retains an amount equal to the sum it would have received
        and retained had no such deductions or withholdings been made;

               (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;
        and

               (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
        to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance with
        applicable law.

        (c) Except as provided in Section 2.14(f), the Borrower agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Lender Party and each Agent for the full amount
of (i) Taxes, (ii) Other Taxes, and (iii) Further Taxes imposed on or paid by
such Lender Party or such Agent (as the case may be) and any liability
(including penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes
were






                                       26
<PAGE>   32

correctly or legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made
within 30 days after the date such Lender Party or such Agent makes written
demand therefor.

        (d) Within 60 days after the date of any payment by the Borrower of
Taxes, Other Taxes or Further Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish to the
Administrative Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original
or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence
of payment satisfactory to such Administrative Agent. In the case of any payment
hereunder by or on behalf of the Borrower through an account or branch outside
the United States or by or on behalf of the Borrower by a payor that is not a
United States person, if the Borrower determines that no Taxes are payable in
respect thereof, the Borrower shall furnish, or cause such payor to furnish, to
the Administrative Agent, at such address, an opinion of counsel acceptable to
the Administrative Agent stating that such payment is exempt from Taxes. For
purposes of this subsection (d) and subsection (e), the terms "United States"
and "United States person" shall have the meanings specified in Section 7701 of
the Internal Revenue Code.

        (e) Each Lender Party organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the United States, on or prior to the date of its execution and delivery of this
Agreement in the case of each Initial Lender, and on the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance pursuant to which it becomes a Lender Party in the case of each
other Lender Party, and from time to time thereafter as requested in writing by
the Borrower and within 60 days of such written request (but only so long as
such Lender Party remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower with two original Internal Revenue Service
Forms 1001 or 4224, as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by
the Internal Revenue Service (including, without limitation, a Form W-8)
certifying that such Lender Party is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate
of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the
Notes, if any. If the form provided by a Lender Party at the time such Lender
Party first becomes a party to this Agreement indicates a United States interest
withholding tax rate in excess of zero, withholding tax at such rate shall be
considered excluded from Taxes unless and until such Lender Party provides the
appropriate forms certifying that a lesser rate applies, whereupon withholding
tax at such lesser rate only shall be considered excluded from Taxes for periods
governed by such form; provided, however, that, if at the date of the Assignment
and Acceptance pursuant to which a Lender Party assignee becomes a party to this
Agreement, the Lender Party assignor was entitled to payments under subsection
(a) in respect of United States withholding tax with respect to interest paid at
such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to
withholding taxes that may be imposed in the future or other amounts otherwise
includable in Taxes) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with
respect to the Lender Party assignee on such date. Such Lender Party agrees to
promptly notify each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of any change
in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or
reduction, and shall provide each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower
with revised versions of the appropriate forms described in this Section 2.14(e)
that reflect such change in circumstance. If any form or document referred to in
this subsection (e) requires the disclosure of information, other than
information necessary to compute the tax payable and information required on the
date hereof by Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 or 4224, that the Lender Party
reasonably considers to be confidential, the Lender Party shall give notice
thereof to the Borrower and shall not be obligated to include in such form or
document such confidential information.






                                       27
<PAGE>   33

        (f) For any period with respect to which a Lender Party has failed to
provide the Borrower with accurate and complete copies of the appropriate form
described in Section 2.14(e) (updated as necessary in accordance therewith)
certifying that such Lender Party is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate
of United States withholding tax on payments pursuant to this Agreement or the
Notes, if any (other than if such failure is due to a change in law occurring
subsequent to the date on which a form originally was required to be provided),
such Lender Party shall not be entitled to indemnification under Section 2.13(a)
or (c) with respect to Taxes imposed by the United States by reason of such
failure; provided, however, that should a Lender Party become subject to Taxes
because of its failure to deliver a form required hereunder, the Borrower shall,
at such Lender Party's expense, take such steps as the Lender Party shall
reasonably request to assist the Lender Party to recover such Taxes.

        (g) If any Lender Party claims exemption from, or reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1001, or
any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, and such
Lender Party sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers
all or part of the obligations of the Borrower to such Lender Party, such Lender
Party agrees to notify each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of the
percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of obligations
of the Borrower to such Lender Party. To the extent of such percentage amount
the Administrative Agent will treat such Lender Party's IRS Form 1001 as no
longer valid and, in the case of a participation, such Lender Party agrees to
undertake sole responsibility for complying with the withholding tax
requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code.

        (h) If any Lender Party claiming exemption from United States
withholding tax by filing IRS Form 4224, or any successor or other form
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, with the Administrative Agent sells,
assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise offers all or part of the
obligations of the Borrower to such Lender Party, such Lender Party agrees to
undertake sole responsibility for complying with the withholding tax
requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Internal Revenue Code.

        (i) If the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental authority
of the United States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the
Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for
the account of any Lender Party (because the appropriate form was not delivered
or was not properly executed, or because such Lender Party failed to notify the
Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason)
such Lender Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts
paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise,
including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by any
jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Administrative Agent under this
Section, together with all cost and expenses (including Attorney Costs). The
obligation of the Lender Parties under this subsection shall survive the payment
of all obligations and the resignation or replacement of the Administrative
Agent.

        Section 2.15. Sharing of Payments, Etc.

        If any Lender Party shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary,
involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on
account of the Advances owing to it (other





                                       28
<PAGE>   34

than pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.14, 2.18, 2.20 or 8.04(d)) in excess of its
ratable share of payments on account of the Advances obtained by all the Lender
Parties, such Lender Party shall forthwith purchase from the other Lender
Parties such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary
to cause such purchasing Lender Party to share the excess payment ratably with
each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess
payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender Party, such purchase
from each Lender Party shall be rescinded and such Lender Party shall repay to
the purchasing Lender Party the purchase price to the extent of such recovery
together with an amount equal to such Lender Party's ratable share (according to
the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender Party's required repayment to
(ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender Party) of any
interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender Party in
respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower agrees that any Lender
Party so purchasing a participation from another Lender Party pursuant to this
Section 2.14 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender Party were the direct creditor of the
Borrower in the amount of such participation.

        Section 2.16. Use of Proceeds.

        The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the Borrower agrees
that it shall use such proceeds) to provide working capital for the Borrower and
for general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries.

        Section 2.17. Extension of Termination Date.

        At least 30 days but not more than 45 days prior to the Maturity Date,
the Borrower, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, may elect to extend
the Termination Date by one calendar year from the Maturity Date. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender Party of such request.
Provided that on the Maturity Date no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, or shall occur as a consequence thereof, the Termination Date shall,
effective as at the Maturity Date, be extended for one calendar year from the
Maturity Date.

        Section 2.18. Substitution of Lenders.

        In the event (a) the obligation of any Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar Rate Advances has been suspended pursuant to Section 2.08(b), (b) any
Lender has demanded compensation under Section 2.11, 2.12, 2.14 or 2.20, which
compensation increases the effective lending rate of such Lender in excess of
the effective lending rate of the other Lenders, or (c) any Lender shall be a
Defaulting Lender, then and in any such event, the Borrower may substitute for
such Lender (the "Affected Lender") another financial institution, which
financial institution shall be an Eligible Assignee, for such Lender to assume
the Commitment of such Affected Lender and to purchase the Note, if any, of such
Affected Lender hereunder in accordance with Section 8.07. Such assumption and
purchase shall be effected by execution and delivery by such Affected Lender and
such replacement Lender of an Assignment and Acceptance, and shall otherwise be
made in the manner described in Section 8.07, provided that the Affected
Lender's obligation to so assign and sell its Commitment and Note, if any, shall
be subject to the condition that all amounts owing to such Affected Lender
(including, without limitation, principal, accrued





                                       29
<PAGE>   35

and unpaid interest and fees, and all amounts owing to such Affected Lender
under Sections 2.11, 2.12, 2.14 and 8.04) shall have been paid in full; provided
that such Affected Lender's rights under Sections 2.11, 2.14 and 8.04, and its
obligations under Section 7.07, shall survive the effective date specified in
the Assignment and Acceptance for such Lender Party as to matters occurring
prior to such date.

        Section 2.19. Evidence of Debt.

        (a) Each Lender Party shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to
such Lender resulting from each Advance owing to such Lender Party from time to
time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
Lender from time to time hereunder. The Borrower agrees that upon notice by any
Lender Party to the Borrower (with a copy of such notice to the Administrative
Agent) to the effect that a promissory note or other evidence of indebtedness is
required or appropriate in order for such Lender Party to evidence (whether for
purposes of pledge, enforcement or otherwise) the Advances owing to, or to be
made by, such Lender Party, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to
such Lender Party, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a promissory note or
other evidence of indebtedness, in the form of Exhibit A hereto or in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and such Lender Party (each a
"Note"), payable to the order of such Lender in a principal amount equal to the
Revolving Credit Commitment of such Lender.

        (b) The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 8.07(d) shall include a control account, and a subsidiary account for
each Lender, in which accounts (taken together) shall be recorded (i) the date
and amount of each Borrowing made hereunder, the Type of Advances comprising
such Borrowing and, if appropriate, the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii)
the terms of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and accepted by it,
(iii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due
and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder, and (iv) the amount of
any sum received by the Administrative Agent from the Borrower hereunder and
each Lender's share thereof.

        (c) Entries made in good faith by the Administrative Agent in the
Register pursuant to subsection (b) above, and by each Lender in its account or
accounts pursuant to subsection (a) above, shall be prima facie evidence of the
amount of principal and interest due and payable or to become due and payable
from the Borrower to, in the case of the Register, each Lender and, in the case
of such account or accounts, such Lender, under this Agreement, absent manifest
error; provided, however, that the failure of the Administrative Agent or such
Lender to make an entry, or any finding that an entry is incorrect, in the
Register or such account or accounts shall not limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement.

        Section 2.20. Additional Interest on Eurodollar Rate Advances.

        The Borrower shall pay to each Lender Party, so long as such Lender
Party shall be required under regulations of the FRB to maintain reserves with
respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency
Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each
Eurodollar Rate Advance of such Lender Party, from the date of such Advance
until such principal amount is paid in full, at an interest rate per annum equal
at all times to the





                                       30
<PAGE>   36

remainder obtained by subtracting (i) the Eurodollar Rate for the Interest
Period for such Advance from (ii) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar
Rate by a percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage
of such Lender for such Interest Period, payable on each date on which interest
is payable on such Advance. Such additional interest shall be determined by such
Lender Party and notified to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent.

        Section 2.21. Presentation of Claims; Certificates.

        Each Lender Party will, within 180 days after obtaining knowledge of any
event occurring after the date hereof, which would entitle such Lender Party to
compensation pursuant to Section 2.11, 2.12, 2.14 or 2.20 (each a "Triggering
Event"), notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such Triggering
Event. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Lender Party
shall be entitled to any compensation pursuant to any such section in respect of
any Triggering Event (a) for any period of time in excess of 180 days prior to
such notice or (b) for any period prior to such notice if such Lender Party
shall not have given notice within 180 days of the date such Triggering Event
shall have been enacted, promulgated, adopted or issued in definitive final
form, except to the extent such Triggering Event is retroactive. Any Lender
Party claiming reimbursement or compensation under any such Section shall
deliver to the Borrower, with a copy to the Administrative Agent, a certificate
setting forth in reasonable detail such claimed amount and such certificate
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

        (f) The Consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries

accountants, duly certified by the chief financial officer of the Borrower,
together with a certificate of said officer stating that such information is
accurate and correct in all material respects, copies of which have been

Borrower's knowledge, threatened action, suit, investigation, litigation or
proceeding affecting the Borrower of any of its Subsidiaries, including without
limitation, any Environmental Action, before any court, governmental agency or

or (ii) purports to affect the




                                       34
<PAGE>   40

legality, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (h) The Borrower is not engaged in the business of extending credit for
the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of
Regulation U issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System),

material liability with respect to "expected post retirement benefit
obligations" within the meaning of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 106.

        (n)(i) Except where it would not be reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, the operations and properties of the Borrower and each
of its Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits, all past non-compliance with such
Environmental Laws and Environmental Permits has been resolved without ongoing
obligations or costs, and no circumstances exist that would be reasonably likely
to (A) form the basis of an Environmental Action against the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their properties that could have a Material Adverse
Effect or (B) cause any such property to be subject to any restrictions on
ownership, occupancy, use or transferability under any Environmental Law that
could have a Material Adverse Effect.

               (i) None of the properties currently or, to the best of the
        Borrower's knowledge, formerly owned or operated by the Borrower or any
        of its Subsidiaries is listed or proposed for listing on the National
        Priorities List under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
        Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("NPL") or on the Comprehensive

<PAGE>   41

        Hazardous Materials are being or have been treated, stored or disposed
        of on any property currently owned or operated by the Borrower or any of
        its Subsidiaries or, to the best of its knowledge, on any property
        formerly owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
        that would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
        there is no asbestos or asbestos-containing material on any property
        currently owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
        that would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
        and Hazardous Materials have not been released, discharged or disposed
        of on any property currently or, to the best of the Borrower's
        knowledge, formerly owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries or, to the best of its knowledge, any adjoining property
        that would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

               (ii) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
        undertaking, and has not completed, either individually or together with
        other potentially responsible parties, any investigation or assessment
        or remedial or response action relating to any actual or threatened
        release, discharge or disposal of Hazardous Materials at any site,
        location or operation, either voluntarily or pursuant to the order of
        any governmental or regulatory authority or the requirements of any
        Environmental Law that would be reasonably likely to result in a
        Material Adverse Effect; and all Hazardous Materials generated, used,
        treated, handled or stored at or transported to or from any property
        currently or, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, formerly owned or
        operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have been disposed
        of in a manner not reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
        Effect.

        (o) The Borrower and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries is in
compliance, in all material respects, with all applicable laws, rules,
regulations and orders and all agreements or instruments evidencing Debt and
other material agreements, in each case by which any of them or their properties
is bound except in any case where the failure to so comply, either individually
or in the aggregate, would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

        (p) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is an "investment
company", an "affiliated person" of an "investment company", or a "promoter" or
"principal underwriter" for an "investment company", as such terms are defined
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Neither the making of any
Advances nor the application of the proceeds therefrom or repayment thereof by
the Borrower, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will
violate any provision of such Act or any rule, regulation or order of the SEC
thereunder.

        (q) There are no Liens of any nature whatsoever on any properties of the
Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries other than Liens permitted under
Section 5.02(a).

        (r) The Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries have filed, have caused to
be filed or have been included in all tax returns (federal, state, local and
foreign) that are, to the best of the Borrower's knowledge after undertaking due
diligence and inquiry in any jurisdiction in which the Borrower has reason to
believe it may be currently subject to taxation (it being understood that the
Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries are under an absolute obligation to
undertake such due diligence and inquiry in each such jurisdiction), required to
be filed or, in the case of





                                       36
<PAGE>   42

income taxes, that are similarly required to be filed and where the failure to
do so would cause the imposition of a penalty or interest, and in each case have
paid all taxes shown thereon to be due, together with applicable interest and
penalties.

        (s) Set forth on Schedule 4.01(s) hereto is a complete and accurate
list, as of the date of the Existing Credit Agreement, of all issued patents,
trademarks, trade names, parties to CDMA license agreements, registered service
marks and registered copyrights of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries,
showing as of the date of the Existing Credit Agreement, the U.S. registration
numbers where applicable.

        (t) Set forth on Schedule 4.01(t) hereto is a complete and accurate
list, as of the date of the Existing Credit Agreement, of all real property
owned or leased by the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with a
book value of $1 million or more or, where no book value is available, with an
annual rent greater than $500,000, in each case, showing as of the date of the
Existing Credit Agreement the street address, county or other relevant
jurisdiction or state, and with respect to any lease, the lessor, lessee,
expiration date and annual rental cost thereof. Each such lease is the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the lessor thereof, enforceable in accordance
with its terms.

        (u) Set forth on Schedule 4.01(u) hereto is a complete and accurate list
as of the date of the Existing Credit Agreement of all categories of Existing
Debt and each individual item of Existing Debt that has a stated value of $5
million or more and, in each case, the amount thereof.

        (v) Set forth on Schedule 4.01(v) hereto is a complete and accurate list
of all equity capital Investments of the Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries as of the date of the Existing Credit Agreement.

        (w) Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure. The Borrower and its Restricted
Subsidiaries have developed and budgeted for a comprehensive program that the
Borrower believes addresses adequately the "Year 2000 problem" (that is, the
inability of computers, as well as embedded microchips in non-computing devices,
to perform properly date-sensitive functions with respect to certain dates prior
to and after December 31, 1999). Based upon such program and the Borrower's
review of the Year 2000 problem performed to date, the Borrower believes that
(1) the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries will substantially avoid the
Year 2000 problem as to all computers, as well as embedded microchips in
non-computing devices, that are material to the Borrower's and its Restricted
Subsidiaries' business, properties or operations taken as a whole and (2) the
failure of its (or its Restricted Subsidiaries') own or a third party's systems
or equipment due to the Year 2000 problem, including those of vendors,
customers, and suppliers, as well as a general failure of or interruption in its
communications and delivery infrastructure, will not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                                   ARTICLE V

                            COVENANTS OF THE BORROWER

        Section 5.01. Affirmative Covenants.

        So long as any Advance shall remain unpaid or any Lender Party shall
have any Commitment hereunder, the Borrower will:

        (a) Compliance with Laws, Etc. Comply, and cause each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to comply, in all material respects, with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and orders, such compliance to include, without limitation,
compliance with ERISA and Environmental Laws as provided in Section 5.01(j).

        (b) Payment of Taxes, Etc. Pay and discharge, and cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to pay and discharge, before the same shall become
delinquent, any and all amounts that either on an individual basis or in the
aggregate equal or exceed $50,000 and that are attributable to (i) all taxes,
assessments and governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its
property and (ii) all lawful claims that, if unpaid, might by law become a Lien
upon its property; provided, however, that neither the Borrower nor any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries shall be required to pay or discharge any such tax,
assessment, charge or claim that is being contested in good faith and by proper
proceedings and as to which appropriate reserves are being maintained, unless
and until any Lien resulting therefrom attaches to its property and becomes
enforceable against its other creditors.

        (c) Maintenance of Insurance. Maintain, and cause each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to maintain, insurance with responsible and reputable insurance
companies or associations in such amounts and covering such risks as is usually
carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning similar properties
in the same general areas in which the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary
operates.

        (d) Preservation of Corporate Existence, Etc. Preserve and maintain, and
cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to preserve and maintain, its
corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided,
however, that the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries may consummate any
merger or consolidation permitted under Section 5.02(b) and provided further
that neither the Borrower nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be
required to preserve any right or franchise if the Board of Directors of the
Borrower or such Subsidiary shall determine that the preservation thereof is no
longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Borrower or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, and that the loss thereof is not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Borrower and the Restricted
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Lender Parties.

        (e) Visitation Rights. At any reasonable time and from time to time, but
in all cases during the Borrower's normal business hours and upon reasonable
notice, permit any Agent or any of the Lender Parties or any agents or
representatives thereof, to examine and make copies of and abstracts from the
records and books of account of, and visit the properties of, the Borrower and
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, and to discuss the affairs, finances and
accounts of the





                                       38
<PAGE>   44

Borrower and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with any of their Responsible
Officers and, upon 5 Business Days' notice to a Responsible Officer, any of the
officers of the Borrower or its Restricted Subsidiaries and with their
independent certified public accountants as may reasonably be necessary to
discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries.

        (f) Keeping of Books. Keep, and cause each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to keep, proper books of record and account, in which full and

each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to maintain and preserve, all of its
properties that are used or useful in the conduct of its business in good
working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted.

        (h) Transactions with Affiliates. Conduct, and cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to conduct, all transactions otherwise permitted under
this Agreement with any of their Affiliates on terms that are fair and
reasonable and no less favorable to the Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiary
than it would obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person not
an Affiliate (it being understood that for purposes of this clause (h), an
"arm's-length transaction" includes a transaction which is (A) commercially
reasonable, (B) conducted in the ordinary course of business of such Borrower or
such Restricted Subsidiary and (C) consistent with past business practices of
such Borrower or such Restricted Subsidiaries).

        (i) Reporting Requirements. Furnish to the Administrative Agent for
distribution promptly to the Lender Parties:

        to GAAP;

        necessary to demonstrate compliance with Section 5.03 provided that, in
        the event of any change in GAAP used in the preparation of such
        financial statements, the Borrower shall also provide, if necessary for
        the determination of compliance with Section 5.03, a statement of
        reconciliation conforming such financial statements to GAAP;

                                   THE AGENTS

        SECTION 7.01. Appointment and Authorization; "Agent"

        Each Lender Party hereby irrevocably (subject to Section 7.09) appoints,
designates and authorizes each Agent to take such action on its behalf under the
provisions of this Agreement and each other Loan Document and to exercise such
powers and perform such duties as are expressly delegated to it by the terms of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, together with this Agreement and each
other Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are
expressly delegated to it by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto;
provided, however, that no Agent shall be required to take any action that
exposes such Agent to personal liability or that is contrary to this Agreement
or applicable law. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document, no Agent shall have
any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor
shall any Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender Party, and no implied covenants, functions. responsibilities, duties,
obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or otherwise exist against such Agent. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term "agent" in this Agreement with
reference to each Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other
implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable
law. Instead, such, term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.

        SECTION 7.02. Delegation of Duties.

        Each Agent may execute any of its duties under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys-in-fact and
shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such
duties.

        SECTION 7.03. Liability of the Agents.

        None of the Agent-Related Persons shall (i) be liable for any action
taken or to be taken by any of them under or in connection with this Agreement
or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby (except for
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct), or (ii) be responsible in any
manner to any of the Lender Parties for any recital, statement, representation
or warranty made by the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of the Borrower,
or any officer thereof, contained in this Agreement or in any other Loan
Document, or in any certificate, report, statement or other document referred to
or provided for in, or received by any Agent under or in connection with, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or the validity, effectiveness,
genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, or for any failure of the Borrower or any other party to any Loan
Document to 




                                       54
<PAGE>   60

perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. No Agent-Related Person shall
be under any obligation to any Lender Party to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records or the Borrower or any of the Borrower's Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

        SECTION 7.04. Reliance by the Agents.

        (a) Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected
in relying, upon any writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate,
affidavit, letter, instrument, telegram, facsimile, telex, telecopier or
telephone message, statement or other document or writing or conversation
believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made
by the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(including counsel to the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by the Agents. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or
refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders
as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by the Lender Parties against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action. Each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document in
accordance with a request or consent of the Required Lenders and such request
and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon
all of the Lender Parties.

        (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Agent (i) may
treat the payee of any Note, if any, as the holder thereof until, in the case of
the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent receives and accepts an
Assignment and Acceptance entered into by the Lender Party that is the payee of
such Note, if any, as assignor, and an Eligible Assignee, as assignee, or, in
the case of any other Agent, such Agent has received notice from the
Administrative Agent that it has received and accepted such Assignment and
Acceptance, in each case as provided in Section 8.07, (ii) makes no warranty or
representation to any Lender Party and shall not be responsible to any Lender
Party for any statements, warranties or representations (whether written or
oral) made in or in connection with any Loan Document; (iii) shall not have any
duty to ascertain or to inquire as to the performance or observance of any of
the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement on the part of the Borrower
or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of the Borrower;
and (iv) shall not be responsible to any Lender Party for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of any
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto.

        (c) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions specified
in Section 3.01, each Lender Party that has executed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter either sent by any Agent to such Lender Party for
consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder to be
consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Lender Party.

<PAGE>   61

        SECTION 7.05. Notice of Default.

        No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence
of any Default or Event of Default, except with respect to defaults in the
payment of principal, interest and fees required to be paid to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders, unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received written notice from a Lender Party or the Borrower
referring to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default". The Administrative Agent will
notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such notice. The Administrative Agent
shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as may
be requested by the Required Lenders in accordance with Article VI; provided,
however, that unless and until the Administrative Agent has received any such
request, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such
action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the
Lender Parties.

        SECTION 7.06. Lender Party Credit Decision.

        Each Lender Party acknowledges that none of the Agent-Related Persons
has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the Agent
hereinafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by
any Agent-Related Person to any Lender Party. Each Lender Party represents to
each Agent that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person and based on the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 and such other documents, and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower
hereunder. Each Lender Party also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent-Related Person and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such investigations as
it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business, prospects, operations,
property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower.
Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly herein required to be
furnished to the Lender Parties by each Agent, no Agent shall have any duty or
responsibility to provide any Lender Party with any credit or other information
concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the possession
of any of the Agent-Related Persons.

        SECTION 7.07. Indemnification of Agents.

        (a) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
each Lender Party shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related Persons (to the
extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of the Borrower and without limiting the
obligation of the Borrower to do so), pro rata, from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities; provided, however, that no Lender Party shall be liable
for the payment to any Agent-Related Person of any portion of such 



                                       56
<PAGE>   62

Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or
willful misconduct as found in a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender Party
shall reimburse the Agents upon demand for its ratable share of any costs or
out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by the Agents in
connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agents are not
reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of the Borrower.

        (b) In the case of any investigation, litigation or proceeding giving
rise to any Agent's Indemnified Liabilities, this Section 7.07 applies whether
any such investigation, litigation or proceeding is brought by any Agent, any
Lender Party or a third party. Without prejudice to the survival of any other
agreement of any Lender Party hereunder, the agreement, obligations and
undertaking of each Lender Party contained in this Section 7.07 shall survive
the payment in full of principal, interest and all other amounts payable
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and the resignation or replacement
of the Agents.

        SECTION 7.08. Agent in Individual Capacity.

        Each of Bank of America, Citibank and their Affiliates may make loans
to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from, acquire
equity interests in and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust,
financial advisory, underwriting or other business with the Borrower and its
Affiliates as though each of Bank of America and Citibank were not an Agent
hereunder and without notice to or consent of the Lenders. The Lender Parties
acknowledge that, pursuant to such activities, Bank of America, Citibank or
their Affiliates may receive information regarding the Borrower and its
Affiliates (including information that may be subject to confidentiality
obligations in favor of the Borrower or such Affiliates) and acknowledge that no
such Agent shall be under any obligation to provide such information to them.
With respect to its Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Note, if any,
issued to it, each of Bank of America and Citibank shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender Party and may exercise the
same as though it were not an Agent.

        SECTION 7.09. Successor Agent.

        Any Agent may, and at the request of the Required Lenders shall, resign
as an Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Lenders. If such Agent resigns under
this Agreement, the Required Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a
successor agent for the Lender Parties which successor agent shall be approved
by the Borrower. If no successor agent is appointed prior to the effective date
of the resignation of such Agent, such Agent may appoint, after consulting with
the Lenders and the Borrower, a successor agent from among the Lender Parties.
Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder, such
successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers, discretion, privileges
and duties of the retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor
agent and the retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as such Agent
shall be terminated. After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Article VII and Section 8.04 shall inure to its benefit
as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was an Agent under
this Agreement. If no 



                                       57
<PAGE>   63

successor agent has accepted appointment as the successor Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Lender Parties shall perform all of the duties of such Agent hereunder until
such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor agent as provided
for above.

        SECTION 7.10. Co-Agents.

        None of the Lender Parties identified on the cover page or signature
pages of this Agreement as a "co-agent" shall have any right, power, obligation,
liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than those
applicable to all Lender Parties as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none
of the Lender Parties so identified as a "co-agent" shall have or be deemed to
have any fiduciary relationship with any other Lender Party. Each Lender Party
acknowledges that it has not relied, and will not rely, on any of the other
Lender Parties so identified in deciding to enter into this Agreement or in
taking or not taking action hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

        SECTION 8.01. Amendments, Etc.

        No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes,
if any, nor consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any
event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Required Lenders and the Borrower with receipt acknowledged by the
Administrative Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in
the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given; provided,
however, that no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and
signed by all the Lender Parties and the Borrower with receipt acknowledged by
the Administrative Agent, do any of the following: (a) waive any of the
conditions specified in Section 3.01, (b) increase the Commitments of the Lender
Parties or subject the Lender Parties to any additional obligations, (c) reduce
the principal of, or interest on, the Notes, if any, or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder, (d) postpone any date fixed for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Notes, if any, or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder, (e) change the percentage of the Commitments or of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Notes, if any, or the number of Lenders
that shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action
hereunder or (f) amend this Section 8.01; and provided further that no
amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agents
in addition to the Lenders required above to take such action, and the Borrower,
affect the rights or duties of the Agents under this Agreement or any Note, if
any.

        SECTION 8.02. Notices, Etc.

        All notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in
writing (including telecopier, telegraphic or telex communication) and mailed,

overnight courier, telecopied, facsimile, delivered to the telegraph company or

counterpart of any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or the
Notes, if any, or of any Exhibit hereto to be executed and delivered hereunder
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof.

        SECTION 8.03. No Waiver; Remedies.

        No failure on the part of any Lender Party or any Agent to exercise, and
no delay in exercising, any right hereunder or under any Note, if any, shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of
any remedies provided by law.

        SECTION 8.04. Costs and Expenses.

        (a) The Borrower shall, whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, pay or reimburse all reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel for the Agents (including in their capacity as Agents) promptly after
demand in connection with the development, preparation, delivery, administration
and execution of, and any amendment, supplement, waiver or modification to (in
each case, whether or not consummated), this Agreement, any Notes, if any, any
other Loan Document and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or
therewith, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including reasonable Attorney Costs incurred by each of Bank of America
and Citibank (including in its capacity as an Agent) with respect thereto; and

        (b) The Borrower shall pay or reimburse the Agents and each Lender Party
within five Business Days after demand (subject to subsection 3.01(f)) for all
costs and expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by them in connection
with the enforcement, attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or
remedies under this Agreement or any other Loan Document during the existence of
an Event of Default or after acceleration of the Loans (including in connection
with any "workout" or restructuring regarding the Loans, and including in any
insolvency proceeding, bankruptcy proceeding, liquidation, winding up,
reorganization, receivership, 



                                       59
<PAGE>   65

arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief of debtors or appellate proceeding
(collectively, an "Insolvency Proceeding")).

        (c) Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
the Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold the Agent-Related Persons, each
Lender Party and each of its Affiliates and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, counsel, agents, advisors and attorneys-in-fact (each, an
"Indemnified Party") harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, claims, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, charges, expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following
repayment of the Advances and the termination, resignation or replacement of any
Agent or replacement of any Lender Party) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted
against any such Person in any way relating to or arising out of or in
connection with or by reason of (including, without limitation, in connection
with any investigation, litigation or proceeding or preparation of a defense in
connection with) (i) this Agreement, any Loan Document or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby
or the actual or proposed use of proceeds of the Advances, or (ii) the actual or
alleged presence of Hazardous Materials on any property of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries or any Environmental Action relating in any way to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or in the case of each of clauses (i) and
(ii) above, any action taken or omitted by any such Person under or in
connection with any of the foregoing, including with respect to any
investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding or
appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Advances or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not any Indemnified
Party is a party thereto and whether or not any such investigation, litigation
or proceeding is brought by the Borrower, its directors, shareholders or
creditors or an Indemnified Party or any other Person, (all the foregoing in
clauses (i) and (ii) above, collectively, being the "Indemnified Liabilities");
provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any
Indemnified Party with respect to Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party as found in
a final, non-appealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. The
Borrower also agrees not to assert any claim against any Agent, any Lender
Party, any of their Affiliates, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, attorneys and agents, on any theory of liability, for special
indirect, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or otherwise relating
to the Notes, if any, this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated
herein or the actual or proposed use of the proceeds of the Advances.

        (d) If any payment of principal of, or Conversion of, any Eurodollar
Rate Advance is made by the Borrower to or for the account of a Lender Party
other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance, as a result
of a payment or Conversion pursuant to Section 2.08(d) or (e), 2.10 or 2.12,
acceleration of the Advances or maturity of the Notes, if any, pursuant to
Section 6.01 or for any other reason, or by an Eligible Assignee to a Lender
Party other than on the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance upon an
assignment of rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to Section
2.18 or pursuant to Section 8.07 as a result of a demand by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 8.07(a), the Borrower shall, upon demand by such Lender
Party (with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender Party any amounts required
to compensate such Lender Party for any additional losses, costs or expenses
that it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or Conversion,
including, without limitation, any loss 



                                       60
<PAGE>   66

(including loss of anticipated profits), cost or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by any
Lender Party to fund or maintain such Advance.

        (e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower contained in
Sections 2.11, 2.14, 2.17, 2.18, 2.20 and 8.04 shall survive the payment in full
of principal, interest and all other amounts payable hereunder and under the
Notes, if any.

        SECTION 8.05. Right of Set-off.
       
        Upon (i) the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of
Default and (ii) the making of the request or the granting of the consent
specified by Section 6.01 to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare the
Advances and the Notes, if any, due and payable pursuant to the provisions of
Section 6.01, each Lender Party and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing
by such Lender Party or such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of
the Borrower against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or
hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Note, if any, held by such
Lender Party, whether or not such Lender Party shall have made any demand under
this Agreement or such Note, if any, and although such obligations may be
unmatured. Each Lender Party agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any
such set-off and application, provided that the failure to give such notice
shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. The rights of
each Lender Party and its Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off)
that such Lender Party and its Affiliates may have.

        SECTION 8.06. Binding Effect; Entire Agreement.

        This Agreement shall become effective (other than Section 2.01, which
shall only become effective upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set
forth in Section 3.01) when it shall have been executed by the Borrower and the
Agents and when the Documentation Agent shall have been notified by each Initial
Lender that such Initial Lender has executed it and thereafter shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each Agent and each Lender Party
and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower shall not
have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the
prior written consent of the Lender Parties. This Agreement, together with the
other Loan Documents, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous proposals,
negotiations, representations, commitments and other communications between or
among the parties, both oral and written, with respect thereto.

        SECTION 8.07. Assignments and Participations.

        (a) Each Lender may and, if demanded by the Borrower pursuant to Section
2.18, will assign to one or more Persons all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes, if
any, held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be



                                       61
<PAGE>   67

of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations under
this Agreement, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to a Person that,
immediately prior to such assignment, was a Lender or an assignment of all of a
Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the
Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned pursuant to each such
assignment (determined as of the date of the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment) shall in no event be less than $10,000,000 or an
integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iii) each such assignment
shall be to an Eligible Assignee, and (iv) the parties to each such assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Borrower for its approval (unless an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing), such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and to the Administrative Agent for its
acceptance and recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance, together
with any Note, if any, subject to such assignment and a processing and
recordation fee of $3,000.

        (b) Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, (x) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender Party hereunder and (y)
the Lender Party assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such Assignment and
Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or
the remaining portion of an assigning Lender Party's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender Party shall cease to be a party hereto).

        (c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender
Party assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with
each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as provided
in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender Party makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with any Loan
Document or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of any Loan Document or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender Party makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the
financial condition of the Borrower or the performance or observance by the
Borrower of any of its obligations under any Loan Document or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms
that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of the
financial statements referred to in Section 4.01 and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will,
independently and without reliance upon any Agent, such assigning Lender Party
or any other Lender Party and based on such documents and information as it
shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee confirms
that it is an Eligible Assignee; (vi) such assignee appoints and authorizes each
Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and
discretion under this Agreement as are delegated to such Agent by the terms
hereof, together with such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental
thereto; and (vii) such assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with
their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement are
required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                                       62
<PAGE>   68

        (d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred to
in Section 8.02 a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lender Parties and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Advances
owing to, each Lender Party from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lender Parties may
treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender Party
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available
for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender Party at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

        (e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender Party and an assignee representing that it is an Eligible
Assignee, (and subject to the Borrower's approval, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) together with any Note or Notes, if any, subject to such
assignment, the Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance
has been completed and is in substantially the form of Exhibit C hereto, (i)
accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained
therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Borrower. In
the case of any assignment by a Lender, within five Business Days after its
receipt of such notice, the Borrower, at its own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note, if
any, a new Note, if any, to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount
equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance
and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to
the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained
by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes, if any, shall be in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered
Note or Notes, if any, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and
Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form of Exhibit A hereto.

        (f) Each Lender Party may sell participations to one or more banks or
other entities that qualify as an Eligible Assignee (other than the Borrower or
any of its Affiliates) in or to all or a portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all or a portion of its
Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note, if any, or Notes, if any,
held by it); provided, however, that (i) such Lender Party's obligations under
this Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment to the Borrower
hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender Party shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) such Lender Party shall remain the holder of any such Note, if any, for
all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrower, the Agents and the other
Lender Parties shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender Party
in connection with such Lender Party's rights and obligations under this
Agreement, (v) no participant under any such participation shall have any right
to approve any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any
Note, if any, or any consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, except
to the extent that such amendment, waiver or consent would reduce the principal
of, or interest on, the Advances and the Notes, if any, or any fees or other
amounts payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such
participation, or postpone any date fixed for any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Advances and the Notes, if any, or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder, in each case to the extent subject to such participation and
(vi) such Lender Party shall give prompt notice to the Borrower of such
participations.

                                       63

        (g) Any Lender Party may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
8.07, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender
Party by or on behalf of the Borrower; provided that, prior to any such
disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
relating to the Borrower received by it from such Lender Party.

        (h) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this Agreement, any
Lender Party may at any time create a security interest in all or any portion of
its rights under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Advances
owing to it and the Note, if any, held by it) in favor of any Federal Reserve
Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.

        SECTION 8.08. Confidentiality.

        Neither any Agent nor any Lender Party shall disclose any Confidential
Information to any other Person without the consent of the Borrower, other than
(a) to such Agent's or such Lender Party's Affiliates and their officers,
directors, employees, agents, auditors, attorneys and advisors and, as
contemplated by Section 8.07(f), to actual or prospective assignees and
participants, and then only on a confidential basis, (b) as required by any law,
rule or regulation or judicial process and (c) as requested or required by any
state, federal or foreign authority or examiner regulating banks or banking. In
the event any Lender Party is contemplating assigning or selling a participation
in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or
more Persons, prior to disclosing any Confidential Information to such Person,
such Person shall be required to execute a confidentiality agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Borrower and such Person.

        SECTION 8.09. Reserved.

        SECTION 8.10. Governing Law.

        This Agreement and the Notes, if any, shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

        SECTION 8.11. Execution in Counterparts.

        This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so
executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a
signature page to this Agreement by telecopier shall be effective as delivery of
a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

        SECTION 8.12. Jurisdiction, Etc.

submits, for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdictions of any
New York State court and any California State court or federal court of the

                                       64

or San Diego, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes, if any, or
for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such New York State
court or any such California State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise
have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the Notes
in the courts of any jurisdiction.

        (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives,
to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Notes in any New
York State or federal court. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court.

_________________________ (the "Lender") for the account of its Applicable

                                                       ASSIGNMENT AND ACCEPTANCE

        Reference is made to the Credit Agreement dated as of March 4, 1999 (as

"Borrower"), the Lender Parties (as defined in the Credit Agreement), Bank of

        1. The Assignor hereby sells and assigns to the Assignee, and the

the Credit Agreement. After giving effect to such sale and assignment, the
Assignee's Commitment and the amount of the Advances owing to the Assignee will

beneficial owner of the interest being assigned by it hereunder and that such

order of the Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by the

retained by the Assignor under the Credit Agreement, respectively, as specified
on Schedule 1 hereto.

        3. The Assignee (i) confirms that it has received a copy of the Credit
Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.01 thereof and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Assignment and Acceptance; (ii) agrees that it will, independently and without

continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
the Credit Agreement; (iii) confirms that it is an Eligible Assignee; (iv)
appoints and authorizes each Agent to take such action as agent on its behalf
and to exercise such powers and discretion under the Credit Agreement as are
delegated to

<PAGE>   77
such Agent by the terms thereof, together with such powers and discretion as are
reasonably incidental thereto; (v) agrees that it will perform in accordance
with their terms all of the obligations that by the terms of the Credit
Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender Party; and (vi)

and Acceptance (the "Effective Date") shall be the date of acceptance hereof by
the Administrative Agent, unless otherwise specified on Schedule 1 hereto.

the Effective Date, (i) the Assignee shall be a party to the Credit Agreement
and, to the extent provided in this Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender Party thereunder and (ii) the Assignor shall, to the
extent provided in this Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under the Credit Agreement.

        6. Upon such acceptance and recording by the Administrative Agent, from
and after the Effective Date, the Administrative Agent shall make all payments
under the Credit Agreement and the Notes in respect of the interest assigned
hereby (including, without limitation, all payments of principal, interest and
facility fees with respect thereto) to the Assignee. The Assignor and Assignee
shall make all appropriate adjustments in payments under the Credit Agreement
and the Notes for periods prior to the Effective Date directly between
themselves.

        7. This Assignment and Acceptance shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

        8. This Assignment and Acceptance may be executed in any number of

which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of Schedule 1 to this Assignment and Acceptance by telecopier shall
be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Assignment
and Acceptance.

To the Lender Parties

dated as of March 4, 1999
among QUALCOMM Incorporated, said Lender
Parties, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, as
Administrative Agent and Syndication Agent and to Citibank, N.A. as

RE:     CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF MARCH 4 1999, AMONG QUALCOMM INCORPORATED,
        AS BORROWER, THE LENDER PARTIES, BANK OF AMERICA NATIONAL TRUST AND
        SAVINGS ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND SYNDICATION AGENT, AND
        CITIBANK, N.A., AS DOCUMENTATION AGENT AND SYNDICATION AGENT

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as counsel for QUALCOMM Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), in connection with the Credit Agreement dated as of March 4, 1999
(the "Credit Agreement"), among the Company, the financial institutions listed
therein as Initial Lenders (the "Lenders"), Bank of America National Trust and
Savings Association as Administrative Agent (the "Administrative Agent") and
Syndication Agent (a "Syndication Agent"), and Citibank, N.A., as Documentation
Agent (the "Documentation Agent") and Syndication Agent (a "Syndication Agent").
We are providing this opinion to you at the request of the Company pursuant to
Section 3.01(g)(v) of the Credit Agreement. Capitalized terms used in this
opinion letter will have the meanings given to such terms in the Credit
Agreement except as otherwise provided in this opinion letter.

In connection with this opinion, we have examined the following documents,:

        1.      the Credit Agreement;

        2.      the Notes dated March 4, 1999 listed on Schedule A hereto;

        3.      the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as
                amended on February 17, 1998, and presently in effect;

        4.      the Bylaws of the Company as adopted August 29, 1991 and
                presently in effect;


<PAGE>   81
The Lender Parties et al.
March 4, 1999
Page Two

        5.      a certificate of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
                dated March 1, 1999, attesting to the continued corporate
                existence and good standing of the Borrower in that State;

        6.      the resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company
                authorizing the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated
                by the Loan Documents adopted at a meeting held on January 27,
                1999; and

        7.      each of the Material Agreements (defined below) set forth on
                Schedule B hereto.

As used herein, the term "Loan Documents" shall mean documents 1 and 2 above.

In connection with this opinion, we have examined and relied upon the
representations and warranties as to factual matters contained in and made
pursuant to the Loan Documents by the various parties and upon originals or
copies certified to our satisfaction of such records, documents, certificates,
opinions, memoranda and other instruments as in our judgment are necessary or
appropriate to enable us to render the opinion expressed below.

Where we render an opinion "to the best of our knowledge" or concerning an item
"known to us" or our opinion otherwise refers to our knowledge, it is based
solely upon (a) an inquiry of attorneys in this firm who perform legal services
for the Company and (b) receipt of a certificate executed by an officer of the
Company covering such matters (the "Company Certificate").

In rendering this opinion, we have assumed, with your consent, the genuineness
and authenticity of all signatures on original documents (other than the
signatures on behalf of the Company on the Loan Documents); the authenticity of
all documents submitted to us as originals; the conformity to originals of all
documents submitted to us as copies; the accuracy, completeness and authenticity
of certificates of public officials; the due authorization, execution and
delivery of all documents, including, without limitation, the due authorization,
execution and delivery of the Loan Documents (except the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company of any Loan Documents) where
authorization, execution and delivery are prerequisites to the effectiveness of
such documents; and that such documents constitute legally valid and binding
obligations of each party thereto (except for the Company) enforceable against
such parties in accordance with their respective terms.

We have also assumed, with your consent, that all individuals executing and
delivering documents have the legal capacity to so execute and deliver; that the
Loan Documents are obligations binding upon the parties thereto (except the
Company); that the Lender Parties and the Agents have filed any required
California franchise or income tax returns and have paid any required California
franchise or income taxes; and that there are no extrinsic agreements or


<PAGE>   82
The Lender Parties et al.
March 4, 1999

understandings among the parties to the Loan Documents that would modify or
interpret the terms of the Loan Documents or the respective rights or
obligations of the parties thereunder.

With your permission, we have assumed, without investigation, that: (a) the
Lenders will disburse the Loans in accordance with the terms of the Credit
Agreement; (b) all Loans required to be disbursed will be disbursed by the
Lender Parties to the Company; (c) all payments of principal and interest due
under the Loan Documents, and all fees and reimbursable costs paid by the
Company with respect thereto, will be received by the Administrative Agent and
the Lender Parties for their own account and applied in payment of the
obligations under the Loan Documents; and (d) at the time of each such
disbursement and payment, all facts and applicable law will be the same as those
existing as of the date of this opinion.

Our opinion is expressed only with respect to the Federal laws of the United
States of America, the laws of the State of California and the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law"). We express no opinion
as to whether the laws of any particular jurisdiction will apply. We note,
however, that the parties to the Loan Documents have designated the laws of the
State of New York as the laws governing the Loan Documents. Our opinion in
paragraph 3 below as to the validity, binding effect and enforceability of the
Loan Documents is premised upon the result that would be obtained if a
California court were to apply the internal laws of the State of California
(notwithstanding the designation of the laws of the State of New York) to the
interpretation and enforcement of the Loan Documents.

We express no opinion (i) relative to the applicability or effect of any law,
rule or regulation relating to securities or to the sale or issuance thereof,
(ii) with respect to the applicability or effect of any pension, employee
benefit or tax laws, including, without limitation, the Internal Revenue Code,
the California Revenue and Taxation Code and the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended, and other similar laws, statutes, acts,
regulations or ordinances, or any decrees or decisional law with respect
thereto, (iii) federal or state antitrust, unfair competition or trade practice
laws or regulations, (iv) compliance with fiduciary requirements, (v) federal or
state environmental laws and regulations, (vi) compliance with any antifraud law
or (vii) federal or state laws and regulations concerning filing requirements,
other than requirements applicable to charter-related documents.

Insofar as any law, rule or regulation of the State of California regarding
maximum allowable interest rates may be applicable, we have, with your
permission, assumed that each of the Agents and each Lender Party is a bank

Our opinions in paragraph 3 below as to the enforceability of any obligations of
the Company under any of the Loan Documents may be limited by or subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency (including, without limitation, all laws relating to
fraudulent transfers), reorganization, moratorium, marshaling or other laws and
rules of law affecting the enforcement generally of creditors' rights and
remedies. In addition, we express no opinion as to the effect of California
Civil Code Section 1717 on the recovery of attorneys' fees in contract actions,
limitations imposed by California law on the appointment of receivers, and the
enforceability of any particular provision of any of the Loan Documents (1)
relating to rights or remedies or as to the availability of any specific or
equitable relief of any kind (and we point out that the enforcement of any of
your rights may be subject in all cases to an implied duty of good faith and
fair dealing and to general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity), (2) where the
breach of such provisions imposes restrictions or burdens upon the debtor,
including the acceleration of indebtedness due under debt instruments, and it
cannot be demonstrated that the enforcement of such restrictions or burdens is
reasonably necessary for the protection of the creditor, (3) whereby any Lender
Party purchasing a participation from another Lender Party may exercise set-off
or similar rights with respect to such participation or (4) relating to (a)
waivers of defenses, rights to trial by jury, or rights to object to
jurisdiction or venue and other rights or benefits bestowed by statute or court
decisions, (b) waivers of provisions which are not capable of waiver under
Section 1-102(3) of the California Uniform Commercial Code or (c) exculpation
clauses, indemnity clauses and clauses relating to releases or waivers of
unmatured claims or rights.

With respect to our opinion in paragraph 4 below, with respect to defaults under
any Material Agreement, we have relied solely upon, (i) an inquiry of officers
of the Company, (ii) a list of agreements certified to us in the Company
Certificate by officers of the Company as all the loan, debt, indenture, note,
mortgage, or similar financing agreements relating to the extension of credit to
Company (a) involving amounts exceeding $15,000,000, or (b) that otherwise
affect or purport to affect the obligation of the Company under any Loan
Document or the right of the Company to borrow money or to consummate the other
transactions contemplated under the Loan Documents (all of which agreements are
listed on Schedule A hereto and are referred to collectively herein as the
"Material Agreements"), and (iii) an examination of the Material Agreements; we
have made no further investigation and reviewed no other documents. With respect
to the list of agreements referred to in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence,
we have with your permission relied solely upon such certificate as to the
accuracy of matters set forth therein even though such certificate may involve
conclusions of law in addition to representations of fact and you understand we
express no opinion as to the accuracy of the certificate or the reasonableness
of reliance thereon.

For purposes of the opinions expressed in paragraphs 4 and 5 below, we have
assumed that the Company will not in the future take any discretionary action
(including a decision not to act)

permitted by the Loan Documents that would cause the payment of the Loan to
violate any California or federal statute, rule or regulation or constitute a
violation or breach of or default under any of the agreements, orders, judgments
or decrees referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 4 or require an
order, consent, permit or approval to be obtained from a California or federal
governmental authority.

We express no opinion as to the effect of non-compliance by the Lender Parties
with any state or federal laws or regulations applicable to the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents because of the nature of the Lenders'
business.

On the basis of the foregoing, in reliance thereon, and with the foregoing
qualifications, we are of the opinion that:

        1.      The Company has been duly incorporated, and is validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, with corporate
power and authority to enter into the Loan Documents and to perform its
obligations thereunder.

        2.      The execution, delivery and performance of the Loan Documents
  have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, and the Loan Documents have been duly executed and delivered by the
Company.

        3.      The Loan Documents constitute legally valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their respective terms.

        4.      The Company's execution and delivery of, and performance of its
obligations on the Effective Date under, the Loan Documents do not (i) violate
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (ii) violate, breach, or
result in a default under, any existing obligation of or restriction on the
Company under any Material Agreement identified in the Company's Certificate, or
(iii) breach or otherwise violate any existing obligation of or restriction on
the Company under any order, judgment or decree of any California or federal
court or governmental authority binding on the Company identified in the
Company's Certificate.

        5.      The execution and delivery by the Company of, and performance of
its obligations under, the Loan Documents do not violate or contravene any
California or federal statute or regulation which, in our experience, is
applicable generally to borrowers in commercial transactions of the nature
contemplated by the Loan Documents.

        6.      No orders, consents, permits or approvals of any California or
federal governmental authority which, in our experience, are applicable
generally to borrowers in commercial transactions of the nature contemplated by
the Loan Documents, are required for the

execution, delivery of, and performance by the Company of its obligations under
the Loan Documents.

        7.      To the best of our knowledge, there are no actions, suits, or
proceedings pending or overtly threatened against the Company which purport to
affect the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of any of the
Loan Documents. Except for those matters described in the Company's Form 10-K
for the Company's fiscal year ending September 27, 1998 filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, we have not given substantive attention on
behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or represented the Company
in connection with, any actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any court, arbitrator or
governmental agency which might have a materially adverse effect upon the
financial condition or operations of the Company or of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. We call your attention to the fact
that our engagement is limited to specific matters as to which we have been
consulted by the Company and its Subsidiaries and to which we have devoted
substantive attention. There may, therefore, be other matters of a legal nature
that could bear on the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to which we
have not been consulted.

Our opinions set forth above are limited to the matters expressly set forth in
this opinion letter, and no opinion may be implied or inferred beyond the
matters expressly stated. This opinion speaks only as to law and facts in effect
or existing as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation or
responsibility to update or supplement this opinion to reflect any facts or
circumstances that may hereafter come to our attention or any changes in or law
which may hereafter occur.

                "Sold," "Sale," "Sell" means put into use, sold, leased or
otherwise transferred and a sale shall be deemed to have occurred upon first use
by a third party, shipment or invoicing, whichever shall first occur.

               "Standards" means those standards which are applicable to CDMA
Applications.

               "Subscriber Units" means (a) complete user terminals which can be
used without any additional equipment or components being attached thereto to
initiate or receive wireless transmissions and (b) CDMA Modules. The term
"Subscriber Units" does not include Infrastructure Equipment or ASICs (other
than those ASICs incorporated and sold in a Party's Subscriber Units).

       2. License Grant By E.

               2.1 License Grant. E hereby grants to Q, effective as of the
Effective Date, a world-wide, nontransferable, non-exclusive license under E's
Licensed Patents to make and Have Made, use, sell, offer for sale, lease or
otherwise dispose of, and import Q's ASICs, test equipment and Globalstar
gateway equipment (collectively, the "Q Licensed Products") for CDMA
Applications. The license further includes (a) the right for the Q Licensed
Products to be [*] and (b) to make and use solely by Q (but not to sell, lease
or otherwise dispose of to third parties) instrumentalities for the development
and manufacture of the Q Licensed Products.

               2.2 Royalties. [*] For the avoidance of doubt, the Sale by Q to a
third party for use in a wireless telephone of a chip or chipset (whether or not
mounted on a circuit card provided that such circuit card is not a finished
product, e.g. a PCMCIA card) that meets the definition of Q's ASICs shall be
treated under this Agreement as an ASIC Sale and not as a Subscriber Unit Sale.

               2.3 Inclusion of Other Patents. At any time and from time to
time, Q can cause any of E's non-Essential Patents to be included in E's
Licensed Patents for CDMA Applications by notifying E, in which case E shall
have the right to cause an equal number of Q's non-Essential Patents to be
included in Q's Licensed Patents for CDMA Applications. The patents so included
by Q or by E shall be deemed to have been so included as of the Effective Date
of this Agreement. In the event that Q causes the same non-Essential Patent of E
to be included in E's Licensed Patents under this Agreement and under the
subscriber unit license agreement of even date herewith, E shall have the right
to cause only a single Patent of Q's non-Essential Patents to be included in Q's
Licensed Patents for use under both agreements.

               2.4 Right to Sublicense. Other than to Manufacturing Licensees as
set forth below and as set forth in Section 2.5, Q shall have the right to grant
sublicenses of the rights set forth in Section 2.1 above only to Affiliates of
Q. In the event that tender requirements or regulatory requirements or
identifiable market requirements in a country so reasonably necessitate, Q, or
Affiliates of Q, may also grant sublicenses to a Manufacturing Licensee(s) to

<PAGE>   6
                                       6



manufacture and supply products designed and developed by Q or by any of its
Affiliates only in the Limited Geographic Territory and only for so long as it
remains a Manufacturing Licensee. Any sublicensed Affiliate shall agree to be
subject in all respects to all of the obligations contained in this Agreement.
Any sublicensed Manufacturing Licensee shall agree in writing to a sublicense
containing terms and conditions not inconsistent with this Agreement, [*]. Any
sublicense granted to a Manufacturing Licensee shall continue only so long as
such Manufacturing Licensee does not assert, either in litigation or by a direct
communication to E, E's Affiliates, E's Manufacturing Licensees or customers for
E Licensed Products, any Essential Patents for CDMA Applications against E
Licensed Products. If such Manufacturing Licensee asserts non-Essential Patents
against E, E's Affiliates, E's Manufacturing Licensees or customers for E
Licensed Products, Q shall use reasonable efforts to cause such Manufacturing
Licensee to withdraw such assertion. Q, in addition to any such sublicensed
Affiliate and Manufacturing Licensee, shall be responsible for failure of any
such sublicensed Affiliate and Manufacturing Licensee to comply with such
obligations and provisions. Any such sublicense shall terminate immediately if
such Affiliate ceases to be an Affiliate of Q or such Manufacturing Licensee
ceases to be a Manufacturing Licensee. Any sublicense to an Affiliate shall be
effective retroactively as of the later of the Effective Date or the date such
Affiliate became an Affiliate. Any sublicense to a Manufacturing Licensee shall
be effective as of the date Q notifies E of such sublicense being granted in
accordance with 2.4.1 below.

               2.4.1 Manufacturing Licensee. Not less than thirty (30) days
prior to commencement of sublicensed operations of any entity which Q desires to
sublicense as a Manufacturing Licensee, Q shall deliver written notice to E
specifying such entity, the nature and percentage of Q's ownership, and the
Limited Geographic Territory in which such Manufacturing Licensee shall
manufacture and sell products and such other information as may be reasonably
requested by E. Q shall ensure that each Manufacturing Licensee exercises the
rights it receives by virtue of becoming a Manufacturing Licensee only in the
Limited Geographic Territory and that each Manufacturing Licensee complies in
all respects with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any breach of
this Agreement by any Manufacturing Licensee shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement by Q.

       2.5 Rights for Q's ASIC Customers.

               2.5.1 Licensed Patents Within Q's ASIC. [*] For the purposes of
this Agreement only, E claims that



* Confidential Treatment Requested
<PAGE>   7
                                       7


all of the Patents In Suit would be infringed by the use of Q's MSM 2300 and MSM
3000 ASICs for their intended purposes and, solely with respect to the rights of
Q and Q's ASIC customers under this Agreement, E agrees not to claim otherwise
and not to claim that any of the Patents In Suit are not Essential Patents to
IS-95 Rev. A and B.

               2.5.2 Essential Patents Not Within Q's ASIC. [*]

               2.5.3 Non-assertion Against E. Any sublicense granted to any ASIC
customer of Q under Section 2.5.1 or 2.5.2 shall continue only so long as such
ASIC customer does not assert, either in litigation or by a direct communication
to E, E's Affiliates, Manufacturing Licensees or customers for E's Licensed
Products, any Essential Patents for CDMA Applications against E's Licensed
Products and such ASIC customer does not dismiss such litigation or withdraw
such assertion or offer a royalty-free license under such patents within thirty
(30) days after Q's receipt of notice from E of such litigation or
communication.

               2.5.4 Royalty Rates for Q's ASIC Customers. E agrees to offer to
Q's ASIC customers, [*] licenses under E's Essential Patents (which have not
been sublicensed in Sections 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above) to make and have made, use,
sell, offer for sale, lease or otherwise dispose of, and import, equipment
incorporating Q's ASICs and used in CDMA Applications other than IS-95 Related
Systems. [*] The royalty rate under such licenses shall be calculated by [*]

[*]

               2.6 No Implied License. The license granted to Q in Section 2.1
and the sublicenses granted to Q's Affiliates and Manufacturing Licensees in
Section 2.4 above specifically exclude, other than as set forth in Sections
2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above, any and all rights to use or sell Q Licensed Products
under circumstances or in a manner which conveys or purports to convey, whether
explicitly, by principles of implied license, patent exhaustion or otherwise, to
any third party user or purchaser of such Q Licensed Products any rights or
licenses under any of E's patents which would not be infringed by the use for
their intended purposes of such Q Licensed Products.

       3. Grant of License from Q to E.

               3.1 License Grant. Q hereby grants to E, effective as of the
Effective Date, a world-wide, non-transferable, non-exclusive license under Q's
Licensed Patents to make and Have Made, use, sell, offer for sale, lease or
otherwise dispose of, and import Infrastructure Equipment for terrestrial-based
CDMA Applications and for satellite-based CDMA Applications to the extent that Q
is not contractually prohibited from granting such license as of the Effective
Date of this Agreement (but should Q on a later date become entitled to license
any additional rights for satellite based CDMA such rights shall be deemed to be
licensed hereunder as of such date conditioned upon E then being willing to
grant a reciprocal license to Q for gateway equipment for satellite
applications) and test equipment for CDMA Applications (collectively, the "E
Licensed Products") and the right to Have Made ASICs for incorporation into E
Licensed Products. Q hereby also grants to E, effective as of the Effective
Date, a world-wide, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to make and Have
Made, use, sell, offer for sale, lease or otherwise dispose of, and import
Infrastructure Equipment and test equipment for terrestrial-based CDMA
Applications under any of Q's patents or patent applications which exist on the
Effective Date and are utilized in the terrestrial-based infrastructure
products/systems used or sold by Q's infrastructure business, and in future
generations of such infrastructure products/systems developed, used or sold by
E. The license further includes [*]

               3.2 [*]

               3.3 Inclusion of Other Patents. At any time and from time to
time, E can cause any of Q's non-Essential Patents to be included in Q's
Licensed Patents for CDMA Applications by notifying Q, in which case Q shall
have the right to cause an equal number of E's non-Essential Patents to be
included in E's Licensed Patents for CDMA Applications. The patents so included
by E or by Q shall be deemed to have been so included as of the Effective Date
of this Agreement. In the event that E causes the same non-Essential Patent of Q
to be included in Q's Licensed Patents under this Agreement and under the
subscriber unit license agreement of even date herewith, Q shall have the right
to cause only a single Patent of E's non-Essential Patents to be included in E's
Licensed Patents for use under both agreements.

               3.4 Right to Sublicense. Other than to Manufacturing Licensees as
set forth below, E shall have the right to grant sublicenses of the rights set
forth in Section 3.1 above only to Affiliates of E. In the event that tender
requirements or regulatory requirements or identifiable market requirements in a
country so reasonably necessitate, E, or its Affiliates, may also grant
sublicenses to a Manufacturing Licensee(s) to manufacture and supply products
designed and developed by E or by any of its Affiliates only in the Limited
Geographic Territory and only for so long as it remains a Manufacturing
Licensee. Any sublicensed Affiliate shall agree to be subject in all respects to
all of the obligations contained in this Agreement. Any sublicensed
Manufacturing Licensee shall agree in writing to a sublicense containing terms
and conditions not inconsistent with this Agreement, [*]. Any sublicense granted
to a Manufacturing Licensee shall continue only so long as such Manufacturing
Licensee does not assert, either in litigation or by a direct communication to
Q, Q's Affiliates, Q's Manufacturing Licensees or customers for Q Licensed
Products, any Essential Patents for CDMA Applications against Q Licensed
Products. If such Manufacturing Licensee asserts non-Essential Patents against
Q, Q's Affiliates, Q's Manufacturing Licensees or customers for Q Licensed
Products, E shall use reasonable efforts to cause such Manufacturing Licensee to
withdraw such assertion. E, in addition to any such sublicensed Affiliate and
Manufacturing Licensee, shall be responsible for failure of any such sublicensed
Affiliate and Manufacturing Licensee to comply with such obligations and
provisions. Any such sublicense shall terminate immediately if such Affiliate
ceases to be an Affiliate of E or such Manufacturing Licensee ceases to be a
Manufacturing Licensee. Any sublicense to an Affiliate shall be effective
retroactively as of the later of the Effective Date or the date such Affiliate
became an Affiliate. Any sublicense to a Manufacturing Licensee shall be
effective as of the date E notifies Q of such sublicense being granted in
accordance with 3.4.1 below.

               3.4.1 Manufacturing Licensee. Not less than thirty (30) days
prior to commencement of sublicensed operations of any entity which E desires to
sublicense as a

<PAGE>   10
                                       10



Manufacturing Licensee, E shall deliver written notice to Q specifying such
entity, the nature and percentage of E's ownership, and the Limited Geographic
Territory in which such Manufacturing Licensee shall manufacture and sell
products and such other information as may be reasonably requested by Q. E shall
ensure that each Manufacturing Licensee exercises the rights it receives by
virtue of becoming a Manufacturing Licensee only in the Limited Geographic
Territory and that each Manufacturing Licensee complies in all respects with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement by any
Manufacturing Licensee shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by E.

               3.5 No Implied License. The license granted to E in Section 3.1
and the sublicenses granted to E's Affiliates and Manufacturing Licensees under
Section 3.4 above specifically exclude any and all rights to use or sell E
Licensed Products under circumstances or in a manner which conveys or purports
to convey, whether explicitly, by principles of implied license, patent
exhaustion or otherwise, to any third party user or purchaser of such E Licensed
Products any rights or licenses under any of Q's patents which would be
infringed by the use for their intended purposes of such E Licensed Products.

       4. Limitations on License Grants.

               4.1 Jointly Owned Patents. With respect to Patents herein
licensed which are owned by a Party jointly with others, the Parties recognize
that there are countries which require the express consent of all inventors or
their assignees to the grant of licenses or rights under patents issued in such
countries for such jointly owned inventions. Each Party hereby expressly gives
such consent, shall obtain such consent from its Affiliates and shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent from its employees and its Affiliates'
employees, and from other third parties, as required to make full and effective
any such licenses and rights granted to the grantee hereunder by such Party and
by another licensor of such grantee.

               If, in spite of such efforts, a Party is unable to obtain such
consents from any such employees or third parties, the resulting inability of
such Party to make full and effective its purported grant of such licenses and
rights shall not be considered to be a breach of this agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, in such case, the licenses and rights shall be considered
granted by each Party to the maximum extent possible, and, consequently, if the
other Party acquires a corresponding license from the employee or third party,
such other Party shall be deemed licensed under the patent.





<PAGE>   11
                                       11



               4.2 Obligations to Third Parties. In the event the exercise of a
license hereunder exposes the grantor or any of its Affiliates to any obligation
to make a payment to a third party (other than payments between a Party and its
Affiliates and its or their employees), or if the license to the grantor imposes
additional obligations on the grantor, [*]. Each Party represents that there is,
at the date of this Agreement, no such obligation to make payments in respect of
any property licensed hereunder.

        5. Release. Subject to settlement of the Litigation, each Party for
itself and its present Affiliates, hereby releases the other Party and the other
Party's present Affiliates and all customers of such other Party and such other
Party's present Affiliates who have purchased or used products herein licensed
to the other Party, from all claims, demands and rights of action which the
first mentioned Party or any of its present Affiliates may have on account of
any act of infringement or alleged infringement of any Licensed Patent prior to
the Effective Date, provided such act would be licensed under this Agreement if
it had occurred subsequent to the Effective Date.

        6. Forbearance. Unless the rights of either Party would be prejudiced
thereby, E and Q agree (to the extent feasible and permitted by law), to forbear
for a reasonable period (not to exceed six months from when each dispute arises)
from bringing (or further actively pursuing) any administrative or court
proceeding contesting the grant or validity of any patent licensed hereunder and
agree to discuss in good faith the resolution of any such dispute. Nothing in or
associated with this Agreement shall be construed as hindering either Party in
any way from challenging the validity of any patent or other intellectual
property right and any such challenge shall not be construed a breach of this
Agreement.

        7. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective
Date hereof and, except as provided in Section 8, continue until the last
Licensed Patent hereunder shall have expired.

        8. Termination.

               8.1 Termination for Breach. If either Party (as the "Defaulting
Party") shall at any time commit any material breach of any material covenant
contained herein and shall fail to remedy any such breach within sixty (60) days
after written notice specifying such breach by the other Party, the
non-defaulting Party may, at its option, terminate all licenses and rights
granted herein to the Defaulting Party. All licenses granted to the Party
terminating the other Party's licenses would survive but only as to Patents
issued prior to the date of termination.

               8.2 Change of Control. In the event that a third party active in
a material way in the field of telecommunications or data communications
acquires 50% or more of the voting



* Confidential Treatment Requested
<PAGE>   12
                                       12



securities of a Party, all licenses granted herein to such Party shall only be
exercisable in manufacturing facilities where and to like degree previously
exercised by such Party and shall not extend to the operations of such owning or
controlling entity without the express consent of the other Party but the other
Party shall have no right to select patents of the acquiring party in accordance
with Section 2.3 or 3.3.

               8.3 Termination of Asset Purchase Agreement. This Agreement shall
terminate automatically and without any further action on the part of either
Party upon any termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

        9. Miscellaneous Provisions.

               9.1 Representations and Disclaimers:

               9.1.1. Representations. Each Party represents and warrants that
it has the right and power to enter into this Agreement and the right to and
authority to grant to the other Party the licenses and rights granted herein.

               9.1.2. Disclaimers. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
construed as:

               (a)    a warranty or representation that any manufacture, sale,
                      lease, use or importation will be free from infringement
                      of patents, copyrights or other intellectual property
                      rights of others, and it shall be the sole responsibility
                      of the licensee Party to make such determination as is
                      necessary with respect to the acquisition of licenses
                      under patents and other intellectual property of third
                      parties;

               (b)    an agreement to bring or prosecute actions or suits
                      against third parties for infringement;

               (c)    an obligation to furnish any manufacturing or technical
                      information or assistance;

               (d)    conferring any right to use, in advertising, publicity or
                      otherwise, any name, trade name or trademark, or any
                      contraction, abbreviation or simulation thereof; and

               (e)    an obligation upon either Party to make any determination
                      as to the applicability of any patent to any product of
                      the other Party.

               Neither Party makes any representations, extends any warranties
               of any kind and assumes no responsibility whatever with respect
               to the manufacture, sale, lease, use or importation of any
               product, or part thereof, by the other Party or any of its



<PAGE>   13
                                       13



               Affiliates or any of its Manufacturing Licensees or any direct or
               indirect supplier or vendee or other transferee of the other
               Party or its Affiliates.

               9.2 No Waiver. No waiver of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, or the failure of either Party strictly to enforce any such term or
condition on one or more occasions shall be construed as a waiver of the same or
of any other term or condition of this Agreement on any other occasion.

               9.3 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any license or rights
hereunder, in whole or in part, shall be assignable or otherwise transferable by
any Party without the written consent of the other Party.

               9.4 Severability. If any term, clause, or provision of this
Agreement shall be judged to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity or
enforceability of any other term, clause or provision, shall not be affected;
and such invalid or unenforceable term, clause, or provision shall be deemed
deleted from this Agreement, and this Agreement shall continue in force, and in
the event such invalid or unenforceable provision is considered a material
element of this Agreement, the Parties shall promptly negotiate a replacement
provision in good faith that best meets the intent of the Parties.

               9.5 Notice. Any notice, request or information shall be deemed to
be sufficiently given to the addressee when forwarded by prepaid, registered or
certified first class mail or by facsimile transmission or hand delivery to the

               9.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire
agreement and understanding between the Parties as to the subject matter hereof,
and merges all prior discussions between them, and no Party hereto shall be
bound by any conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or
representations with respect to such subject matter other than as expressly
provided herein, or as duly set forth on or subsequent to the date hereof in

               9.8 Dispute Resolution.

                      9.8.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in
        accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New York,
        U.S.A.

                      9.8.2 Resolution Procedures. In the event of any alleged
        breach of the Agreement or any dispute between the Parties arising under
        this Agreement, the Parties shall adopt the following procedures for
        resolution of the matter:

                      9.8.2.1 Negotiated Resolution. The Parties shall first
               attempt to resolve the matter by a meeting between executive
               level managers of both parties to review a presentation by each
               Party concerning the alleged breach or matter in dispute. Only if
               the executive level managers are unable to resolve the alleged
               breach or dispute within thirty (30) days of the meeting shall
               either Party be free to proceed under Section 9.1 or to institute
               a claim or action under Section 9.8.2.2.

                      9.8.2.2 Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out

        its Affiliate or Manufacturing Licensee, although such products may be
        co-branded with the trademarks, trade names, or other commercial indicia
        of the reseller or distributor of such products. The requirements of
        this subparagraph (iv) shall not apply where a customer requires that
        the product bear only such customer's trademarks, trade names, or other
        commercial indicia.

               "Infrastructure Equipment" means network equipment, including but

               2.2 Royalties. The license to Q in Section 2.1 shall be [*] with

                                       7



patents so included by Q or by E shall be deemed to have been so included as of
the Effective Date of this Agreement. In the event that Q causes the same
non-Essential Patent of E to be included in E's Licensed Patents under this
Agreement and under the Multi-Product License Agreement of even date herewith, E
shall have the right to cause only a single Patent of Q's non-Essential Patents
to be included in Q's Licensed Patents for use under both agreements.

               2.4 Right to Sublicense. Other than to Manufacturing Licensees as
set forth below, Q shall have the right to grant sublicenses of the rights set
forth in Section 2.1 above only to Affiliates of Q. In the event that tender
requirements or regulatory requirements or identifiable market requirements in a
country so reasonably necessitate, Q, or Affiliates of Q, may also grant
sublicenses to a Manufacturing Licensee(s) to manufacture and supply products
designed and developed by Q or by any of its Affiliates only in the Limited
Geographic Territory and only for so long as it remains a Manufacturing
Licensee. Any sublicensed Affiliate shall agree to be subject in all respects to
all of the obligations contained in this Agreement, including but not limited to
the payment of royalties on any Subscriber Units sold by such Affiliate. Any
sublicensed Manufacturing Licensee shall agree in writing to a sublicense
containing terms and conditions not inconsistent with this Agreement, including
but not limited to the payment of royalties on any Subscriber Units sold by such
Manufacturing Licensee, [*]. Any sublicense granted to a Manufacturing Licensee
shall continue only so long as such Manufacturing Licensee does not assert,
either in litigation or by a direct communication to E, E's Affiliates, E's
Manufacturing Licensees or customers for E Licensed Products, any Essential
Patents for CDMA Applications against E Licensed Products. If such Manufacturing
Licensee asserts non-Essential Patents against E, E's Affiliates, E's
Manufacturing Licensees or customers for E Licensed Products, Q shall use
reasonable efforts to cause such Manufacturing Licensee to withdraw such
assertion. Q shall report to E the Net Selling Price for all Reportable
Subscriber Units Sold by each Affiliate and Manufacturing Licensee that is
granted a sublicense. Q, in addition to any such sublicensed Affiliate and
Manufacturing Licensee, shall be responsible for failure of any such sublicensed
Affiliate and Manufacturing Licensee to comply with such obligations and
provisions. Any such sublicense shall terminate immediately if such Affiliate
ceases to be an Affiliate of Q or such Manufacturing Licensee ceases to be a
Manufacturing Licensee. Any sublicense to an Affiliate shall be effective
retroactively as of the later of the Effective Date or the date such Affiliate
became an Affiliate. Any sublicense to a Manufacturing Licensee shall be
effective as of the date Q notifies E of such sublicense being granted in
accordance with 2.4.1 below.

                    2.4.1 Manufacturing Licensee. Not less than thirty (30) days
prior to commencement of sublicensed operations of any entity which Q desires to
sublicense as a Manufacturing Licensee, Q shall deliver written notice to E
specifying such entity, the nature and percentage of Q's ownership, and the
Limited Geographic Territory in which such Manufacturing Licensee shall
manufacture and sell products and such other information as may be reasonably
requested by E. Q shall ensure that each Manufacturing Licensee exercises the

rights it receives by virtue of becoming a Manufacturing Licensee only in the
Limited Geographic Territory and that each Manufacturing Licensee complies in
all respects with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any breach of
this Agreement by any Manufacturing Licensee shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement by Q.

               2.5 [*]

               2.6 No Implied License. The license granted to Q in Section 2.1
and the sublicenses granted to Q's Affiliates and Manufacturing Licensees in
Section 2.4 above specifically exclude any and all rights to use or sell Q
Licensed Products under circumstances or in a manner which conveys or purports
to convey, whether explicitly, by principles of implied license, patent
exhaustion or otherwise, to any third party user or purchaser of such Q Licensed
Products any rights or licenses under any of E's patents which would not be
infringed by the use for their intended purposes of such Q Licensed Products.

Effective Date, a world-wide, non-transferable, non-exclusive [*] license under
Q's Licensed Patents to make and Have Made, use, sell, offer for sale, lease or
otherwise dispose of, and import Subscriber Units, designed by E or its
Affiliates and which design is owned by E or its Affiliates, for CDMA
Applications (the above licensed Subscriber Units are hereafter referred to as
the "E Licensed Products") and the right to Have Made ASICs for incorporation
into E Licensed Products. The license further includes [*]. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, E is not granted a license
under any of Q's patents to sell any CDMA Modules or ASICs to any third party,
directly or indirectly, for incorporation into a wireless telephone.

               3.2 Royalties. Within sixty (60) days after the end of each
calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement, E agrees to pay Q a royalty
equal to [*]

                    3.2.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
maximum royalty payable by E on any Subscriber Unit (other than telephones) Sold

where Q holds Patents which would be infringed by the importation or Sale of
such Subscriber Units.

                    3.2.3 If E sells a CDMA Module to an Affiliate or
Manufacturing Licensee of E for incorporation into a Subscriber Unit, then the
royalty shall be [*].

               3.3 Inclusion of Other Patents. At any time and from time to
time, E can cause any of Q's non-Essential Patents to be included in Q's
Licensed Patents for CDMA Applications by notifying Q, in which case Q shall
have the right to cause an equal number of E's non-Essential Patents to be
included in E's Licensed Patents for CDMA Applications. The patents so included
by E or by Q shall be deemed to have been so included as of the Effective Date
of this Agreement. In the event that E causes the same non-Essential Patent of Q
to be included in Q's Licensed Patents under this Agreement and under the
Multi-Product License Agreement of even date herewith, Q shall have the right to
cause only a single Patent of E's non-Essential Patents to be included in E's
Licensed Patents for use under both agreements.

               3.4 Right to Sublicense. Other than to Manufacturing Licensees as
set forth below, E shall have the right to grant sublicenses of the rights set
forth in Section 3.1 above only to Affiliates of E. In the event that tender
requirements or regulatory requirements or identifiable market requirements in a
country so reasonably necessitate, E, or its Affiliates, may also grant
sublicenses to a Manufacturing Licensee(s) to manufacture and supply products
designed and developed by E or by any of its Affiliates only in the Limited
Geographic Territory and only for so long as it remains a Manufacturing
Licensee. Any sublicensed Affiliate shall agree to be subject in all respects to
all of the obligations contained in this Agreement, including but not limited to
the payment of royalties on any Subscriber Units Sold by such Affiliate. Any
sublicensed Manufacturing Licensee shall agree in writing to a sublicense
containing terms and conditions not inconsistent with this Agreement, including
but not limited to the payment of royalties on any Subscriber Units sold by such
Manufacturing Licensee, [*]. Any sublicense granted to a Manufacturing Licensee
shall continue only so long as such Manufacturing Licensee does not assert,
either in litigation or by a direct communication to Q, Q's Affiliates, Q's
Manufacturing Licensees or customers for Q Licensed Products, any Essential
Patents for CDMA Applications against Q Licensed Products. If such Manufacturing
Licensee asserts non-Essential Patents against Q, Q's Affiliates, Q's
Manufacturing Licensees or customers for Q Licensed Products, E shall use
reasonable efforts to cause such Manufacturing Licensee to withdraw such
assertion. E shall report to Q the Net Selling Price for all Subscriber Units
Sold by each Affiliate and Manufacturing Licensee that is granted a sublicense.
E, in addition to any such sublicensed Affiliate and Manufacturing Licensee,
shall be responsible for failure of any such sublicensed Affiliate and
Manufacturing Licensee to comply with such

obligations and provisions. Any such sublicense shall terminate immediately if
such Affiliate ceases to be an Affiliate of E or such Manufacturing Licensee
ceases to be a Manufacturing Licensee. Any sublicense to an Affiliate shall be
effective retroactively as of the later of the Effective Date or the date such
Affiliate became an Affiliate. Any sublicense to a Manufacturing Licensee shall
be effective as of the date E notifies Q of such sublicense being granted in
accordance with 3.4.1 below.

                    3.4.1 Manufacturing Licensee. Not less than thirty (30) days
prior to commencement of sublicensed operations of any entity which E desires to
sublicense as a Manufacturing Licensee, E shall deliver written notice to Q
specifying such entity, the nature and percentage of E's ownership, and the
Limited Geographic Territory in which such Manufacturing Licensee shall

[*]

               3.6 [*]

               3.7 No Implied License. The license granted to E in Section 3.1
and the sublicenses granted to E's Affiliates and Manufacturing Licensees under
Section 3.4 above specifically exclude any and all rights to use or sell E
Licensed Products under circumstances or in a manner which conveys or purports
to convey, whether explicitly, by principles of implied license, patent
exhaustion or otherwise, to any third party user or purchaser of such E Licensed
Products any rights or licenses under any of Q's patents which would be
infringed by the use for their intended purposes of such E Licensed Products.

       4. Limitations on License Grants.

               4.1 Jointly Owned Patents. With respect to Patents herein
licensed which are owned by a Party jointly with others, the Parties recognize
that there are countries which require the express consent of all inventors or
their assignees to the grant of licenses or rights under patents issued in such
countries for such jointly owned inventions. Each Party hereby expressly gives
such consent, shall obtain such consent from its Affiliates and shall use all
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent from its employees and its Affiliates'
employees, and from other third parties, as required to make full and effective
any such licenses and rights granted to the grantee hereunder by such Party and
by another licensor of such grantee.

               If, in spite of such efforts, a Party is unable to obtain such
consents from any such employees or third parties, the resulting inability of
such Party to make full and effective its purported grant of such licenses and
rights shall not be considered to be a breach of this agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, in such case, the licenses and rights shall be considered
granted by each Party to the maximum extent possible, and, consequently, if the
other Party

                                       13



acquires a corresponding license from the employee or third party, such other
Party shall be deemed licensed under the patent.

               4.2 Obligations to Third Parties. In the event the exercise of a
license hereunder exposes the grantor or any of its Affiliates to any obligation
to make a payment to a third party (other than payments between a Party and its
Affiliates and its or their employees), or if the license to the grantor imposes
additional obligations on the grantor, the grantee shall, at the request of the
grantor, [*]

        5. Release. Subject to settlement of the Litigation, each Party for
itself and its present Affiliates, hereby releases the other Party and the other
Party's present Affiliates and all customers of such other Party and such other
Party's present Affiliates who have purchased or used products herein licensed
to the other Party, from all claims, demands and rights of action which the
first mentioned Party or any of its present Affiliates may have on account of
any act of infringement or alleged infringement of any Licensed Patent prior to
the Effective Date, provided such act would be licensed under this Agreement if
it had occurred subsequent to the Effective Date.

        6. Purchases from Licensed Sources. Subject to Sections 2.2.2 and 3.2.2,
royalties shall be payable under this Agreement on Subscriber Units Sold by a
Party which use any of the other Party's Licensed Patents (including but not
limited to by use of an ASIC from whomsoever purchased). If either Party (as the
"Purchasing Party") purchases Subscriber Units (other than CDMA Modules) from a
third party, which third party is licensed under all of the other Party's
Licensed Patents contained in such Subscriber Unit, then, as long as the
Purchasing Party is not purchasing such Subscriber Units under its Have Made
rights granted to it under this Agreement, the Purchasing Party shall not be
required to pay royalties to the other Party with respect to such Subscriber
Units. For CDMA Modules purchased by the Purchasing Party from a CDMA Modules
manufacturer exercising license rights granted by the other Party to manufacture
and sell such CDMA Modules for its own account, the Purchasing Party shall be
entitled to [*] in calculating the Net Sales Price of the Subscriber Unit
containing such CDMA Module for royalty calculation purposes under Section 2.2
or Section 3.2 provided that such third party is licensed to convey to
purchasers all necessary rights under the non-Purchasing Party's Licensed
Patents to use such CDMA Module. [*]

        7. Taxes. Withholding taxes and any other taxes levied anywhere in the
world upon payments by the paying Party to the licensor Party of royalties under
this Agreement and



* Confidential Treatment Requested
<PAGE>   14
                                       14



required to be withheld from such payments shall be withheld and paid by the [*]
to the appropriate tax authorities. In connection therewith, the gross amounts
to be paid shall be adjusted in such a manner that all such taxes are for [*].
Promptly after each such tax payment, the official tax receipts or other
evidence issued by the tax authority concerned shall be forwarded to [*] to
enable it to support a claim for tax credit.

        8. Conversion to U.S. Dollars. Royalties shall be paid in U.S. dollars
by wire-transfer and at a bank to be designated by the payee. To the extent that
the Net Selling Price for Subscriber Units Sold outside of the United States is
paid to the selling Party other than in U.S. dollars, then such Party shall
convert the portion of the royalty payable to the licensor from such Net Selling
Price into U.S. dollars at the official rate of exchange of the currency of the
country from which the Net Selling Price was paid, as quoted by the U.S. Wall
Street Journal (or the Chase Manhattan Bank or another agreed-upon source if not
quoted in the Wall Street Journal) for the last business day of the calendar
quarter in which such Subscriber Units were Sold. If the transfer of or the
conversion into U.S. dollars is not lawful or possible, the payment of such part
of the royalties as is necessary shall be made by the deposit thereof, in the
currency of the country where the sale was made on which the royalty was based
to the credit and account of the licensor Party or its nominee in any commercial
bank or trust company of the licensor Party's choice located in that country,
prompt notice of which shall be given by the paying Party to the licensor Party.

        9. Forbearance. Unless the rights of either Party would be prejudiced
thereby, E and Q agree (to the extent feasible and permitted by law), to forbear
for a reasonable period (not to exceed six months from when each dispute arises)
from bringing (or further actively pursuing) any administrative or court
proceeding contesting the grant or validity of any patent licensed hereunder and
agree to discuss in good faith the resolution of any such dispute. Nothing in or
associated with this Agreement shall be construed as hindering either Party in
any way from challenging the validity of any patent or other intellectual
property right and any such challenge shall not be construed a breach of this
Agreement.

        10. Third Party Infringement. Upon discovery by either Party (Licensee
Party) of any infringement by a third party (the "Infringer") of any Licensed
Patent(s) of the other Party (Licensor Party) which results in a material
competitive disadvantage to the Licensee party in a country or countries by
virtue of its being a licensee under this Agreement, the Licensee Party shall
promptly notify the Licensor Party of such infringement. [*]

[*]

        11. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective
Date hereof and, except as provided in Section 13, continue until the last
Licensed Patent hereunder shall have expired.

        12. Records and Remittances.

               12.1 Audits. Each Party (and each of its sublicensed Affiliates
and Manufacturing Licensees), as a licensee, shall keep clear and accurate
records with respect to Subscriber Units. Each Party, as a licensor, shall have
the right, through independent certified public accountants of its choosing (but
reasonably acceptable to the other Party) to receive a list of all sublicensed
Affiliates during the audit period and to examine and audit, during normal
business hours, semi-annually (or at less frequent intervals) all such records
and such other records and accounts as may under recognized accounting practices
contain information bearing upon the amount of royalties payable to it under
this Agreement. Prompt adjustment shall be made by any Party who has made any
error or omission disclosed by such examination or audit to compensate for any
errors or omissions disclosed by such examination or audit. Neither such right
to examine and audit, nor the right to receive such adjustments, shall be
affected by statements to the contrary appearing on checks or otherwise, unless
any such right is expressly waived by the Party having such right. Each Party,
as a licensee, shall furnish the other whatever additional information the other
Party may reasonably prescribe from time to time to enable such other Party to
ascertain whether Subscriber Units Sold by the licensee Party or any of its
Affiliates or Manufacturing Licensees are subject to payment of royalties
hereunder and the amount payable thereon. If the adjustment payable to the
licensor Party after such audit is equal to 10% or greater of the amount
actually remitted to the licensor Party for that period, the licensee Party
shall bear the cost of the audit.

               12.2 Certified Statement. Within sixty (60) days following the
end of each calendar quarter during the term of this Agreement, each Party, as a
licensee, shall furnish the other Party, as a licensor, with a statement, in a
form reasonably acceptable to the licensor Party, certified by an officer of the
licensee Party, recording: i) the Net Selling Price of all Subscriber Units Sold
during such calendar quarter in countries not exempted from royalty payments
with a separate itemization of the Net Selling Price of CDMA Modules, ii) the
amount of royalties payable thereon, and iii) the countries in which the
manufacture, sale or use of Subscriber Units took place which are believed to be
exempt from the payment of royalties, and briefly, the reason therefor. If no
Subscriber Units have been Sold for that calendar quarter, that fact shall be
shown on such statement.

               12.3 Late Payments. Payments when provided for in this Agreement
shall, when overdue, bear interest computed monthly (prorated for periods of
time less than one month) at [*] If the amount of such charge exceeds the
maximum permitted by law, such charge shall be reduced to such maximum.

        13. Termination.

               13.1 Termination for Breach. If either Party (as the "Defaulting
Party") shall at any time materially default in the payment of any royalty or
the making of any report hereunder, or shall commit any material breach of any
material covenant contained herein, or shall make any material false report and
shall fail to remedy any such default, breach or report within sixty (60) days
after written notice specifying such default, breach or report by the other
Party, the non-defaulting Party may, at its option, terminate all licenses and
rights granted herein to the Defaulting Party. All licenses granted to the Party
terminating the other Party's licenses would survive but only as to Patents
issued prior to the date of termination. However, in respect of any alleged
breach or default due to failure to report, a false report, or to make payment
of royalties under this Agreement, the Party alleging such breach or default
shall exhaust all of the Dispute Resolution Procedures under Section 14.8.2.1
before giving notice of breach or default and termination of this Agreement to
the Party alleged to be in breach or default.

               13.2 Change of Control. In the event that a third party active in
a material way in the field of telecommunications or data communications
acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of a Party, all licenses granted
herein to such Party shall only be exercisable in manufacturing facilities where
and to like degree previously exercised by such Party and shall not extend to
the operations of such owning or controlling entity without the express consent
of the other Party but the other Party shall have no right to select patents of
the acquiring party in accordance with Section 2.3 or 3.3.

               13.3 Termination of Asset Purchase Agreement. This Agreement
shall terminate automatically and without any further action on the part of
either Party upon any termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement.

               13.4 Rights upon Termination. Any termination or expiration of
this Agreement shall not relieve the licensee Party from its obligations to make
a report or from its liability for payment of royalties on Subscriber Units Sold
on or prior to the date of such termination or expiration and shall not
prejudice the right to recover the full amount of any royalties or other sums
due or accrued at the time of such termination or expiration and shall not
prejudice any cause of action or claim accrued or to accrue on account of any
breach or default. Furthermore, any termination or expiration of this Agreement
under this Section shall not prejudice the right of the licensor Party to
conduct a final audit of the records of the licensee Party in accordance with
the provisions of Section 12.1 hereof.

                             intellectual property rights of others, and it
                             shall be the sole responsibility of the licensee
                             Party to make such determination as is necessary
                             with respect to the acquisition of licenses under
                             patents and other intellectual property of third
                             parties;

                      (b)    an agreement to bring or prosecute actions or suits

                      (c)    an obligation to furnish any manufacturing or

                             simulation thereof; and

                      (e)    an obligation upon either Party to make any
                             determination as to the applicability of any patent
                             to any product of the other Party.

               Neither Party makes any representations, extends any warranties
               of any kind and assumes no responsibility whatever with respect
               to the manufacture, sale, lease, use or importation of any
               product, or part thereof, by the other Party or any of its

Agreement, or the failure of either Party strictly to enforce any such term or

hereunder, in whole or in part, shall be assignable or otherwise transferable by
any Party without the written consent of the other Party.

               14.4 Severability. If any term, clause, or provision of this
Agreement shall be judged to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity or
enforceability of any other term, clause or provision, shall not be affected;
and such invalid or unenforceable term, clause, or provision shall be deemed
deleted from this Agreement, and this Agreement shall continue in force, and in
the event such invalid or unenforceable provision is considered a material
element of this Agreement, the Parties shall promptly negotiate a replacement
provision in good faith that best meets the intent of the Parties.

to be sufficiently given to the addressee when forwarded by prepaid, registered

                      14.7.2 Resolution Procedures. In the event of any alleged
        breach of the Agreement or any dispute between the Parties arising under
        this Agreement, the Parties shall adopt the following procedures for
        resolution of the matter:

                      14.7.2.1 Negotiated Resolution. The Parties shall first
               attempt to resolve the matter by a meeting between executive
               level managers of both parties to review a presentation by each
               Party concerning the alleged breach or matter in dispute. Only if
               the executive level managers are unable to resolve the alleged
               breach or dispute within thirty (30) days of the meeting shall
               either Party be free to proceed under Section 13.1 or to
               institute a claim or action under Section 14.7.2.2.

                      14.7.2.2 Arbitration. Any controversy or claim arising out
               of or relating to this Agreement, its interpretation,
               performance, or termination, or the breach thereof that has not
               been resolved under Section 14.7.2.1 shall be settled by
               arbitration conducted in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration
               of the International Chamber of Commerce then in effect on the
               date of such controversy or claim. Any such arbitration shall
               take place in the City of New York and shall be conducted before
               a panel of three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such
               Rules (each Party shall select one impartial arbitrator who shall
               together select the third arbitrator) and the decision of the
               selected arbitrators shall be binding and conclusive upon the
               parties, their successors and assigns, who shall comply with such
               decision in good faith as if it were a final decision of a court
               of competent jurisdiction. Judgment upon the arbitrators' award
               may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the
               event either Party disputes its obligation to pay the other Party
               royalties and prevails in such dispute, then any royalties paid
               under protest by such Party from the date it first gave notice of
               its desire to invoke the procedures of Section 14.7.2.1 with
               respect to such disputed royalties shall be repaid by the other
               Party with interest from such date computed at the rate set forth
               in Section 12.3.

                    SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE

     This SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE (this "Release") is entered 
into as of March 24, 1999 by and between QUALCOMM Incorporated, a Delaware 
corporation, and QUALCOMM Personal Electronics, a California partnership 
(collectively, "QUALCOMM"), on the one hand, and Telefonaktiebolaget LM 
Ericsson (publ), a Swedish corporation, and Ericsson Inc., a Delaware 
corporation (collectively, "Ericcson"), on the other hand.

                                    RECITALS

     A.   QUALCOMM and Ericsson are parties in the civil action entitled 
"Ericsson Inc. et al. v. QUALCOMM Inc. et al.," Civil Action No. 
2:96cv183-DF/HWM (Consolidated), in the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division, as well as the civil action 
untitled "OKI America, Inc. v. Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, Sweden and 
Ericsson Inc.," No. C-96 20747 RMW (EAI), in the United States District Court 
for the Northern District of California, San Jose Division (together, the 
"Litigation"), and by entering into this Release agree to stay and ultimately 
to settle and dismiss their respective claims in the Litigation and to release 
all existing claims relating thereto, subject to the terms and conditions 
hereof;

     B.   Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Release, 
QUALCOMM and Ericsson have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset 
Purchase Agreement") pursuant to which Ericsson has agreed to purchase and 
QUALCOMM has agreed to sell substantially all the assets and liabilities of 
QUALCOMM's infrastructure business (the "Acquired Business"), subject to 
the terms and conditions thereof; and

     C.   Also simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Release, 
in connection with the settlement of the Litigation and the purchase and sale 
of the Acquired Business, QUALCOMM and Ericsson have entered into a 
Multi-Product License Agreement and a Subscriber Unit License Agreement (the 
"License Agreements") pursuant to which each party has agreed to grant the 
other party a license under the specific patents identified in the License 
Agreements and such other patents as may be designated under the terms of the 
License Agreements for use in CDMA applications, including but not limited to, 
in cdmaone (including 1S-95, 1S-95A, 1S-95B, ANSI J-STD-008 and Q-CDMA), 
cdma2000 and W-CDMA, contingent upon the Closing of the purchase and sale of 
the Acquired Business pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement.

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the License Agreements, the receipt
and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby agree as 
follows:

<PAGE>   2
                                       2


     1.   Stay.  Upon the execution of this Release, Ericsson and QUALCOMM agree
to stay the Litigation for a period of four months, and shall jointly move for 
an immediate stay of all proceedings and of all pending decisions by each court 
in the Litigation for such period. The parties agree that in the event of any 
termination of the Asset Purchase Agreement prior to the end of such period, 
the stay shall be lifted, and the parties shall jointly move therefor.

     2.   Dismissal.  Upon the Closing (as defined in the Asset Purchase

        THIS FIRST AMENDMENT TO REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (this "Amendment"),
dated as of March 4, 1999 is entered into by and among QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a
Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the banks, financial institutions and
other institutional lenders (the "Initial Lenders") listed on the signature
pages hereof, Bank of America N.T. & S.A. ("BankAmerica"), as administrative
agent (the "Administrative Agent"), initial issuing bank (the "Initial Issuing
Bank"), and syndication agent, and Citibank, N.A. ("Citibank"), as documentation
agent (the "Documentation Agent") and syndication agent (together with
BankAmerica, the "Syndication Agents"), for the Lender Parties (as hereinafter
defined), agree as follows.

                                    RECITALS

        WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent are
parties to the U.S. $400,000,000.00 Credit Agreement, dated as of March 11, 1998
(the "Credit Agreement"), pursuant to which the Lenders have extended certain
credit facilities to the Borrower;

        WHEREAS, the Borrower, the Lenders, and the Administrative Agent now
hereby wish to amend the Credit Agreement in certain respects, all as set forth
in greater detail below;

        NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and for other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.      Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings assigned in the Credit Agreement.

2.      Amendment to Credit Agreement.

               (a) Amendment to Section 1.01. Section 1.01 of the Credit
Agreement is hereby amended to add each of the following terms in its property
alphabetical order:

               "364-Day Credit Agreement" means the U.S. $200,000,000 Credit
               Agreement (364-Day) dated as of March 4, 1999 among the Borrower,
               Bank of America National Trust & Savings Association as
               Administrative Agent and Syndication Agent, Citibank, N.A. as
               Documentation Agent and Syndication Agent, and the other
               financial institutions party thereto.

               "Year 2000 problem" has the meaning specified in subsection
4.01(w).

               (b) Amendment to subsection 2.04(a). The fifth line of subsection
2.04(a) is hereby amended to delete the word "average" and insert the word
"actual" in its stead.

               (c) Amendments to Section 4.01.

                      (i) Section 4.01 is hereby amended to add the following
subsection (w):


<PAGE>   2
                      (w) Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure. The Borrower and its
                      Restricted Subsidiaries have developed and budgeted for a
                      comprehensive program that the Borrower believes addresses
                      adequately the "Year 2000 problem" (that is, the inability
                      of computers, as well as embedded microchips in
                      non-computing devices, to perform properly date-sensitive
                      functions with respect to certain dates prior to and after
                      December 31, 1999). Based upon such program and the
                      Borrower's review of the Year 2000 problem performed to
                      date, the Borrower believes that (1) the Borrower and its
                      Restricted Subsidiaries will substantially avoid the Year
                      2000 problem as to all computers, as well as embedded
                      microchips in non-computing devices, that are material to
                      the Borrower's and its Restricted Subsidiaries' business,
                      properties or operations taken as a whole and (2) the
                      failure of its (or its Restricted Subsidiaries') own or a
                      third party's systems or equipment due to the Year 2000
                      problem, including those of vendors, customers, and
                      suppliers, as well as a general failure of or interruption
                      in its communications and delivery infrastructure, will
                      not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                      (ii) Subsection 4.01(b)(ii) is hereby amended to read in
its entirety as follows:

                      (ii) Each Subsidiary of the Borrower (x) is duly
                      organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
                      laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and (y) has
                      all requisite power and authority (including, without
                      limitation, all governmental licenses, permits and other
                      approvals) to own or lease and operate its properties and
                      to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed
                      to be conducted.

                      (iii) Subsection 4.01(b)(iii) is hereby deleted.

               (d) Amendment to subsection 5.02(d). Item (II) of subsection
5.02(d)(i)(D) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety
as follows:

               (II) either (x) the maturity thereof is at least one year after
               the Termination Date in effect at the time of the incurrence of
               such Debt and any amortization thereof shall commence no earlier
               than such Termination Date, or (y) such Debt is incurred pursuant
               to the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents (as
               defined in the 364-Day Credit Agreement) and

               (e) Amendment to subsection 5.02(i). Item (A) of subsection
5.02(i)(i) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended to read in its entirety as
follows:

               (A) the prepayment of the Advances in accordance with the terms
               of this Agreement or the prepayment of the "Advances" in
               accordance with the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement,

               (f) Amendments to Section 6.01.


                                       2


<PAGE>   3
                    (i) Subsection 6.01(m) is hereby amended to add the word
                "or" after the semicolon.

                    (ii) Section 6.01 is hereby amended to add the following
                subsection (n):

                        (n) there shall occur any "Event of Default" as defined
                        in the 364-Day Credit Agreement;

3. Representations and Warranties. The Borrower hereby represents and warrants
to the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders as follows:

               (a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of
this Amendment have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other
action and do not and will not require any registration with, consent or
approval of, notice to or action by, any Person (including any governmental
authority) in order to be effective and enforceable. The Credit Agreement as
amended by this Amendment constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its respective
terms, without defense, counterclaim or offset.

               (b) All representations and warranties of the Borrower contained
in the Credit Agreement are true and correct as though made on and as of the
date hereof (except to the extent such representations and warranties
specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case they were true and correct
as of such earlier date).

               (c) The Borrower is entering into this Amendment on the basis of
its own investigation and for its own reasons, without reliance upon the Agents,
any Lender or any other person.

4. Effective Date. This Amendment will become effective as of March 4, 1999,
provided that each of the following has occurred:

               (a) The Administrative Agent has received from the Borrower and
the Required Lenders a duly executed original or facsimile of this Amendment;
and

               (b) All conditions precedent to the first Loan under the 364-Day
Credit Agreement (as defined in Section 2 above) other than the effectiveness of
this Amendment shall have occurred.

5. Miscellaneous.

               (a) Except as herein expressly amended, all terms, covenants and
provisions of the Credit Agreement are and shall remain in full force and
effect, and all references therein and in the other Loan Documents to the Credit
Agreement shall henceforth refer to the Credit Agreement as amended by this
Amendment. This Amendment shall be deemed incorporated into, and a part of, the
Credit Agreement.

<PAGE>   4
               (b) This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties to the Credit Agreement and their respective successors and
assigns. No third party beneficiaries are intended in connection with this
Amendment.

accordance with the law of the State of New York.

               (d) This Amendment may be executed in any number of counterparts,

together, shall be deemed to constitute but one and the same instrument.

               (e) This Amendment, together with the Credit Agreement, contains
the entire and exclusive agreement of the parties hereto with reference to the
matters discussed herein and therein. This Amendment supersedes all prior drafts

               (f) If any term or provision of this Amendment shall be deemed
prohibited by or invalid under any applicable law, such provision shall be
invalidated without affecting the remaining provisions of this Amendment or the
Credit Agreement, respectively.

               (g) The Borrower hereby covenants to pay or to reimburse the
Administrative Agent, upon demand, for all costs and expenses (including
