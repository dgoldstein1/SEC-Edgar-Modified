*  Excludes the Common Stock held by executive officers, directors and
   stockholders whose ownership exceeds 5% of the Common Stock outstanding at
   November 21, 1997. Exclusion of such shares should not be construed to

                              EXPLANATORY STATEMENT

    This Amendment No. 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for QUALCOMM
Incorporated (the "Company") for the fiscal year ended September 28, 1997 is
being filed to amend Item 14 (a) (3) by adding as Exhibits, certain amended and
restated financial data schedules.

    As reported in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended September 28, 1997 (the "Initial Form 10-K"), the Company was required to
adopt, in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128 ("FAS 128"), "Earnings Per Share," which required a
retroactive change in the method used to compute and display earnings per share
information. Although pro forma earnings per share information in accordance
with FAS No. 128 was presented in the Initial Form 10-K, financial data
schedules restated in accordance with FAS No. 128, were not required to be filed
at that time and were not included. Such restated financial data schedules are
now being filed pursuant to this Amendment No. 1. This Amendment No. 1 is also
being filed to amend certain amounts in the restated financial data schedules,
as footnoted, to properly state information required by Regulation S-K, Item 601
(c), Appendix A.
