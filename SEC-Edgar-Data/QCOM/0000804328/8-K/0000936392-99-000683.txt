        such conversion is dilutive.

"except that it shall include", the phrase [***].

       (ix)   Section 2.08(b)(ii) of the Purchase Agreement is amended by adding
at the end of the first sentence thereof the following:

       "; provided further, however, that the Purchaser may not dispute amounts
       reflected on the Closing Statement of Net Assets on the basis that the
       [***] do not comply with U.S. GAAP (it being understood that the
       Purchaser may dispute amounts solely on the basis that such amounts were
       not arrived at on a basis consistent with the preparation of the January
       Statement of Net Assets (except to the extent such inconsistency is
       mandated by Section 2.08(a)), that such amounts reflect clerical or
       mathematical error or that such amounts do not properly adjust to
       include only the book value of the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
       and to eliminate the book value of the Excluded Assets and the Excluded
       Liabilities)".

       (x)    The second sentence of Section 2.08(c) of the Purchase Agreement

to continuing our work together in support of a single CDMA standard to connect
