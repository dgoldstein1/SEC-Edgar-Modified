ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

        On March 1, 2000, QUALCOMM Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
("QUALCOMM"), completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock
of SnapTrack, Inc., a California corporation ("SnapTrack"). The acquisition was
effected pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"), dated January 25, 2000 by and among
QUALCOMM, Falcon Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM ("Merger Sub"), and SnapTrack, whereby Merger Sub
was merged with and into SnapTrack (the "Merger"), with SnapTrack being the
surviving corporation in the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM.
In addition, QUALCOMM assumed all of the outstanding options and warrants to
purchase capital stock of SnapTrack in connection with the Merger and such
options and warrants are now exercisable for shares of QUALCOMM common stock.
The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and
will be accounted for as a "purchase." For a detailed description of the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement, reference is made to such agreement,
which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

        As a result of the Merger, QUALCOMM is obligated to issue up to
7,433,792 shares of its common stock to the securityholders of SnapTrack;
provided however, that 10% of the total shares will be subject to an escrow for
a period of one year (which one-year period could be extended in the event any
claims are made) to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the SnapTrack
securityholders that run in favor of QUALCOMM and its affiliates.

        Certain stockholders of SnapTrack who are entitled to receive an
aggregate of 1,949,509 shares of QUALCOMM common stock in the Merger have
executed lock-up agreements that impose certain limitations on such
stockholders' ability to sell or otherwise transfer such shares. For a detailed
description of the terms and conditions of the lock-up agreements, reference is
made to such agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 2.2 through 2.5 hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 7.(b)(1) UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
OF QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

        On March 1, 2000 (the "Closing Date"), QUALCOMM completed the
acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of SnapTrack (see "Item 2.
Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.") in a transaction accounted for as a
purchase. The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
data present the effect of QUALCOMM`s acquisition of SnapTrack. The unaudited
pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet presents the consolidated
financial position of QUALCOMM as of December 26, 1999, assuming that the
acquisition had occurred as of that date. Such pro forma information is based
upon the historical balance sheet data of QUALCOMM as of December 26, 1999 and
SnapTrack as of December 31, 1999. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated statements of income for the year ended September 30, 1999 and for
the three months ended December 26, 1999 give effect to earnings as if the
acquisition had occurred on October 1, 1998. The unaudited pro forma condensed
consolidated financial data are prepared using the purchase method of
accounting.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data are based
on the estimates and assumptions set forth in the notes to such statements,
which are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing such
pro forma information. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
data are not necessarily an indication of the results that would have been
achieved had the transaction been consummated as of the dates indicated.

        The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial data should be
read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto
of QUALCOMM, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
September 30, 1999 and the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
December 26, 1999, and the historical financial statements of SnapTrack for the
year ended December 31, 1999, included herein.

                              QUALCOMM INCORPORATED

    NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Note 1 - Basis of Presentation

        On the Closing Date, QUALCOMM completed the acquisition of all of the
outstanding capital stock of SnapTrack (see "Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition
of Assets.") in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The fair value of the
QUALCOMM common stock issuable to effect the purchase is estimated to be
approximately $139.56 per share based on the average closing price of QUALCOMM's
common stock for the four-day period ending on the Closing Date. The average
fair value of 1,543,876 replacement options and 86,193 warrants to purchase
QUALCOMM's common stock is estimated to be approximately $138.42 per share,
determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model assuming a 6.5%
risk-free interest rate, 54% volatility and an expected life of 3.5 years. The
purchase price of the SnapTrack acquisition is estimated to be approximately $1
billion, including the value of the QUALCOMM shares, the value of vested and
unvested options and warrants issued at the Closing Date and estimated
transaction costs of $1.6 million.

        The preliminary allocation of the purchase price using balances at March
1, 2000 is summarized below (in thousands):

        The preliminary purchase price allocation is based on the estimated fair
values of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities and an independent
appraisal of intangible assets. The Company expects to finalize the purchase
price allocation within one year and does not anticipate material adjustments to
the preliminary purchase price allocation presented. The amount allocated to
in-process technology represents the purchased in-process technology for
projects that, as of the date of the acquisition, had not yet reached
technological feasibility and had no alternative future use. The value of these
projects was determined by estimating the resulting net cash flows from the sale
of the products from completion of the projects, reduced by the portion of
revenue attributable to developed technology and the percentage completion of
the project. The resulting cash flows were then discounted back to their present
value at appropriate discount rates. The amounts allocated to in-process
technology were charged to the statement of income in the second quarter of
QUALCOMM's fiscal year 2000.

Note 2 - Pro Forma Adjustments

(a)     Reflects cash proceeds paid by QUALCOMM to SnapTrack shareholders for
        fractional shares.

(b)     Reflects deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the
        acquisition and the preliminary purchase price allocation described in
        Note 1.

                                       8.
<PAGE>   9

(c)     Reflects goodwill resulting from the acquisition based on the
        preliminary purchase price allocation described in Note 1 as if the
        acquisition had occurred on December 26, 1999.

(d)     Reflects $7 million in deferred tax assets and other intangible assets
        resulting from the acquisition based on the preliminary purchase price
        allocation described in Note 1 as if the acquisition had occurred on
        December 26, 1999.

(e)     Reflects accrued liabilities related to transaction costs incurred by
        QUALCOMM.

(f)     Reflects an adjustment to reduce SnapTrack's unearned revenue to fair
        value.

(g)     Reflects the estimated value of common stock issuable to effect the
        purchase.

(h)     Reflects the elimination of SnapTrack's equity.

(i)     Reflects amounts allocated to in-process technology based on the
        preliminary purchase price allocation described in Note 1.

(j)     SnapTrack research and development expense includes $0.2 million and
        $1.3 million for the first three months in fiscal 2000 and the year
        ended September 30, 1999, respectively, in amortization of deferred
        stock compensation related to SnapTrack cheap stock issuance. Such cost
        is duplicative, as the fair value of the stock has been included in the
        purchase price which results in additional goodwill amortization, and
        will not be recorded by QUALCOMM in periods subsequent to the purchase.

(k)     SnapTrack selling, general and administrative expense includes $0.2
        million and $1.2 million for the first three months in fiscal 2000 and
        the year ended September 30, 1999, respectively, in amortization of
        deferred stock compensation related to SnapTrack cheap stock issuance.
        Such cost is duplicative, as the fair value of the stock has been
        included in the purchase price which results in additional goodwill
        amortization, and will not be recorded by QUALCOMM in periods subsequent
        to the purchase.

(l)     Reflects amortization of patents, assembled workforce, completed
        technology, customer base and goodwill over their estimated useful lives
        of four years as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of
        the periods presented. The amount allocated to in-process technology has
        not been included in the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
        statements of operations as it is nonrecurring. This amount was expensed
        in the second quarter of QUALCOMM's fiscal 2000.

(m)     Reflects the estimated tax benefit related to SnapTrack's net loss and
        the change in deferred tax liabilities resulting from the amortization
        of certain of the intangible assets recorded as part of the acquisition.

(n)     Basic and diluted net earnings per share is computed using the weighted
        average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Unaudited
        pro forma basic and diluted net earnings per share include 5,792,120
        shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the acquisition
        of SnapTrack. Unaudited pro forma diluted net earnings per share for the
        three months ended December 26, 1999 include 1,641,618 dilutive shares
        issuable in connection with replacement stock options and warrants; such
        shares have not been considered in calculating net loss per common share
        for the year ended September 30, 1999 because their effect would be
        anti-dilutive. QUALCOMM effected a four-for-one stock split in December
        1999; pro forma net

                                       9.

        earnings per common share for the year ended September 30, 1999 are
        presented giving retroactive effect to the stock split.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of
  SnapTrack, Inc. and Subsidiary

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SnapTrack, Inc.
and subsidiary (a development stage company) as of December 31, 1999 and 1998,
and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income,
shareholders' deficit and cash flows for the years then ended and cumulative
from August 31, 1995 (inception) through December 31, 1999. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SnapTrack, Inc. and its subsidiary
as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the results of their operations and their
cash flows for the periods stated above, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

1.      BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

        ORGANIZATION - SnapTrack Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on August
        31, 1995 in California, and is engaged in the development of an
        ultra-high performance tracking system that integrates a Global
        Positioning Satellite System receiver, a two-way wireless transceiver,
        and a Geographic Information System. The Company has developed a
        prototype for this device and is continuing to refine and enhance its
        technical capabilities. The Company is subject to the risks associated
        with a development stage enterprise, including the need to refine its
        product technology, to extend its marketing and distribution channels
        and to continue to raise financing.

        DEVELOPMENT STAGE - The Company is in the development stage as of
        December 31, 1999. Successful completion of the Company's developmental
        program and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations is
        dependent upon future events, including future financing, successfully
        completing product development, and achieving a sufficient level of
        sales and market demand to become an established operating enterprise.
        The activities of the Company have been accounted for as set forth in
        Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 7, "Accounting and
        Reporting by Development Stage Enterprises."

        ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
        generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make
        estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, and
        liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
        date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues
        and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
        from those estimates.

        The Company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves a
        number of risks, some of which are beyond the Company's control, and
        could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,
        operating results, and financial condition. These risks include
        variability and uncertainty of revenues and operating results; product
        concentration, technological change, and new products; competition;
        intellectual property/litigation; management of growth; dependence on
        key personnel; limited sources of component supply; licenses from third
        parties; geographic concentration; acquisitions and investments;
        international operations; regulatory requirements; expansion of
        distribution channels; and year 2000 compatibility issues.

        CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK - Financial instruments which potentially
        subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily
        of cash equivalents and receivables. The Company invests only in
        high-quality credit instruments.

        CASH AND EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid debt
        instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
        equivalents. Cash equivalents at December 31, 1999 consisted of
        commercial paper. The carrying amount of the Company's cash equivalents
        approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of those
        investments.

        RECEIVABLES - At December 31, 1999, receivables consists entirely of
        amounts billed in connection with five software licenses and related
        consulting. Revenue recognition on these contracts has been deferred
        pending completion of contractual obligations. At December 31, 1998,
        receivables consist entirely of amounts billed in connection with two
        service contracts.

        PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are recorded at cost
        less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
        straight-line method over estimated useful lives of one to three years
        or the lease term, if shorter.

        LONG-LIVED ASSETS - The Company evaluates long-lived assets for
        impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
        carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

        REVENUE RECOGNITION - Service revenues related to installation, training
        and customer support are recognized upon completion. For contracts
        requiring customer acceptance, revenue recognition is deferred pending
        such acceptance.

        In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Position ("SOP") 97-2,
        "Software Revenue Recognition," which requires revenue earned on
        software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to
        each element based on the relative fair values of the elements. Revenue
        for software licenses is recognized upon delivery provided that
        collection is probable. Software support and maintenance revenue are
        deferred and amortized over the maintenance period on a straight-line
        basis. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the
        Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT - Research and development expenses are charged
        to operations as incurred.

        INCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of
        temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and
        liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
        income tax purposes, as well as net operating loss and tax credit
        carryforwards, net of a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax
        assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realizable.

        STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION - The Company accounts for stock-based awards
        issued to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with
        Accounting Principles Board Opinion (APB) No. 25, "Accounting for Stock
        Issued to Employees."

        RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD - In June 1998, the Financial
        Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for
        Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires
        companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets or
        liabilities, measured at fair value. Gains or losses resulting from
        changes in the values of those derivatives would be accounted for
        depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for
        hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 will be effective for the Company's year
        ending December 31, 2001. The Company has not completed its assessment
        of the impact on this statement of the Company's financial position,
        results of operations or cash flows.

        In connection with both the equipment term loan agreement and the
        venture loan agreement, the Company issued certain Series D preferred
        stock warrants (Note 5). The value of the warrants are being amortized
        on a straight-line basis over the term of the loans.

5.      SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

        CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

        Significant terms of the Series A, B, C and D preferred stock are as
        follows:

        -       Each share is convertible into one share of common stock
                (subject to adjustments for events of dilution) at any time at
                the option of the holder. Conversion is automatic in the event
                of a firm underwritten public offering of common stock meeting
                certain criteria.

        -       Each share has voting rights equal to the number of shares of
                common stock into which it may convert.

        -       In the event of liquidation, merger, dissolution or winding up
                of the Company, preferred shareholders shall first receive $0.50
                per share for Series A, $0.625 per share for Series B, $1.375
                per share for Series C and $4.815 per share for Series D, plus
                any declared and unpaid dividends. After payment of preferential
                amounts, the holders of common stock shall be entitled to
                receive all remaining assets of the Company.

        -       To the extent declared, annual per share dividends of $0.025 on
                Series A, $0.03125 on Series B, $0.07 on Series C and $0.24 on
                Series D must be paid prior to any common stock dividends.

        STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

        Under the 1995 Stock Purchase Plan, 859,500 shares of common stock were
        authorized for issuance to key personnel at fair market value. At
        December 31, 1999, all shares had been sold under this plan, and 2,503
        shares are subject to repurchase by the Company at the original issue
        price if the purchaser's employment with the Company is terminated. The
        Company's repurchase rights lapse ratably over a four-year period.

        STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS

        In March 1999, in connection with the venture and equipment loan
        agreements (Note 4), the Company issued warrants to purchase 22,700
        shares of Series D preferred stock at a price of $4.815 per share. The
        warrants were valued at $70,340 and expire in March 2007.

        In February 1998, in connection with the venture loan agreement (Note
        4), the Company issued warrants to purchase 105,454 shares of Series C
        preferred stock at a price of $1.375 per share. The warrants were valued
        at $72,658 and expire in March 2005.



                                      -10-
<PAGE>   11

        In April 1998, in connection with a users consortium agreement, the
        Company issued warrants to purchase 30,000 shares of common stock at a
        price of $1.375 per share. The warrants had nominal value and expire in
        April 2003.

        In December 1997, in connection with the equipment term and venture loan
        agreement (Note 4), the Company issued warrants to purchase 54,544
        shares of Series C preferred stock at $1.375 per share. The warrants
        were valued at $20,917 and expire in December 2004.

        The value of the above warrants have been estimated using the
        Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:
        expected life, the term of the option, risk free interest rate of 4.66%
        in 1999, 5.43% in 1998 and 5.73% in 1997, 75% volatility in 1999 and 50%
        volatility in 1998 and 1997 and no dividend during the expected term.

        STOCK OPTION PLAN

        Under the 1995 Stock Option Plan, 4,318,500 shares of common stock have
        been authorized for the grant of incentive or nonqualified stock
        options. Options must be granted at not less than fair market value (85%
        of fair value for nonqualified options). Such options generally vest
        over four years and expire in ten years.

        Stock option activity is as follows:

        At December 31, 1999, exercisable options had a weighted average
        exercise price of $0.487. At December 31, 1998, options to purchase
        795,694 shares were exercisable with a weighted average exercise price
        of $0.10. At December 31, 1999, options to purchase 302,312 shares of
        common stock were available for future grant.

        DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION

        In connection with grants of certain stock options in 1999, the Company
        recorded deferred stock compensation of $33,461,426 for the difference
        between the estimated fair value for accounting purposes and the stock
        price as determined by the Board of Directors on the date of grant. This
        amount is being amortized to expense using the straight-line approach
        over the vesting period of the related stock options, generally four
        years. Amortization of deferred stock compensation for the year ended
        December 31, 1999 was $2,939,525.

        ADDITIONAL STOCK PLAN INFORMATION

        As discussed in Note 1, the Company accounts for its stock-based awards
        using the intrinsic value method in accordance with APB No. 25,
        "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" and its related
        interpretations. Accordingly, no compensation expense has been
        recognized in the financial statements for employee stock arrangements
        which are granted with exercise prices equal to or less than the fair
        market value at grant date.

        SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," requires the
        disclosure of pro forma net loss had the Company adopted the fair value
        method. Under SFAS 123, the fair value of stock-based awards to
        employees is calculated through the use of option pricing models, even
        though such models were developed to estimate the fair value of freely
        tradable, fully transferable options without vesting restrictions, which
        significantly differ from the Company's stock option awards. These
        models also require subjective assumptions, including expected time to
        exercise, which greatly affect the calculated values. The Company's
        calculations were made using the minimum value option pricing model with
        the following weighted average assumptions: expected life, five years;
        risk free interest rate, ranging from approximately 4.7% to 6.1% in 1999
        and approximately 5.4% in 1998, respectively; and no dividend payments
        during the expected term. The Company's calculations are based on a
        single option valuation approach and forfeitures are recognized as they
        occur. If the computed fair values of the options had been amortized to
        expense over the vesting period of the awards, the effect on pro forma
        net loss would not have been material. However, the 1999 and 1998 pro
        forma adjustments may not be indicative of future period pro forma
        adjustments.

        On December 15, 1998, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one
        stock split effective January 18, 1999. All references to share and per
        share amounts in the accompanying financial statements give retroactive
        effect to reflect the split.

6.      INCOME TAXES

        Significant components of the Company's deferred income tax assets and
        liabilities are as follows:

</TABLE>

        Due to the uncertainties surrounding the utilization of its net deferred
        tax assets, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance to fully
        provide against its otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets at
        December 31, 1999 and 1998.

        Current federal and California tax laws include substantial restrictions
        on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event
        of an "ownership change" of a corporation.

7.      LEASE COMMITMENTS

        The Company occupies facilities under leases which expire at various
        dates through July 2004. Rental expense for the years ended December 31,
        1999, 1998 and cumulative from inception was approximately $342,265,
        $158,000, and $500,265, respectively. Future minimum lease payments are
        approximately $493,153, $395,908, $143,201, $53,509 and $31,430 in 2000,
        2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

8.      RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

        The Company obtains legal services from shareholders. Legal expenses
        with these shareholders for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998
        and cumulative from inception were approximately $590,000, $646,000, and
        $1,560,000, respectively.

9.      PENDING LITIGATION

        The Company is involved in various legal proceedings. Management, after
        reviewing these proceedings with legal counsel, believes the aggregate
        liability, if any, will not materially affect the consolidated financial
        condition or results of operations of the Company. However, the outcome
        of litigation is inherently uncertain and no assurance can be given as
        to the ultimate resolution.

10.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

        On March 1, 2000 the Company shareholders sold 100% of the stock of the
        Company to Qualcomm, Inc. for approximately $1 billion in Qualcomm, Inc.
        stock.
