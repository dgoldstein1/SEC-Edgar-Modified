          QUALCOMM REPORTS THIRD FISCAL QUARTER REVENUES OF $1 BILLION
    - OPERATING EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $.75, EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING CHARGES -

ALL OF THE SHARE AND PER-SHARE AMOUNTS IN THIS RELEASE HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO
REFLECT THE 2:1 STOCK DISTRIBUTION THAT WAS PAID MAY 10, 1999 TO QUALCOMM
STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD ON APRIL 21, 1999.


SAN DIEGO - July 19, 1999 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM) today reported
revenues of $1 billion and net income of $59 million, or $.35 per share
(diluted), for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 (see Financial Data comparisons,
pg. 6). Excluding non-recurring charges of $117 million associated primarily
with the sale of the Company's terrestrial Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
wireless infrastructure business, the Company reported record net income in the
third quarter of $135 million, or $.75 earnings per share (diluted). This
represents an increase in net income, excluding non-recurring items, of 445
percent over the third quarter of fiscal 1998. Revenues in the third quarter of
fiscal 1999 increased 15 percent over revenues of $875 million for the year ago
quarter. This revenue growth was due to increased communications systems
revenues consisting of sales of Application Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASICs), OmniTRACS units and CDMA phones, as well as a significant increase in
royalties.

"We are pleased to report very strong third fiscal quarter results. Revenues
reached the billion dollar mark and we had record net income," said Dr. Irwin
Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM Incorporated. "We achieved several
important milestones this quarter, including closing the sale of the terrestrial
CDMA wireless infrastructure business, attaining the number two position in
digital phone market share in the U.S.

(according to  Dataquest),  and shipping over 11 million MSM chips to CDMA phone
manufacturers worldwide. We are also pleased to have been selected for inclusion
in the S&P 500 index."

PRO FORMA RESULTS
(EXCLUDING INFRASTRUCTURE BUSINESS AND NON-RECURRING CHARGES)

Pro forma financial information is provided for the purpose of evaluating what
the Company's operating results would have been excluding both non-recurring
charges and operating results of the terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure
business. For the third quarter of fiscal 1999, pro forma revenues were $966
million, pro forma gross profit was 42 percent, pro forma net income was $154
million, and pro forma earnings per share were $.86 (diluted).

Non-recurring pre-tax charges of $117 million were reported in connection with
the sale of the terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure business (primarily
employee-related costs) and including the write-down of certain infrastructure
business related assets not being acquired.

HIGHLIGHTS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

Communications Systems

Communications systems revenues increased 9 percent to $824 million in the third
quarter of fiscal 1999 from $759 million in the year ago quarter, with increased
sales of ASICs, OmniTRACS units and CDMA phones. Communications systems revenues
in the third quarter of fiscal 1998 included significantly higher revenues from
Globalstar gateways, terrestrial CDMA wireless infrastructure products and
QUALCOMM Personal Electronics (QPE) sales to Sony. Excluding these items in the
year ago quarter, revenue growth would have been 49 percent. Communications
systems gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 was 35 percent
compared to 24 percent in the third quarter of fiscal

1998, reflecting improved margins in all product areas with the exception of
infrastructure products.

Total CDMA phone shipments for the third fiscal quarter of 1999 were over 1.7
million units (cumulatively over 12 million). Component shortages limited
production growth and margin improvement of the Company's phone products in the
third fiscal quarter of 1999. These shortages are expected to continue and could
affect the Company's results in the fourth fiscal quarter of 1999. Total MSM
phone chip shipments for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 were over 11 million
units (cumulatively over 50 million). In addition to substantial growth in the
shipment of MSM phone chips, the book-to-bill ratio for the ASICs business was
1.2 for the third quarter of fiscal 1999. The book-to-bill ratio means the
Company has $1.20 in ASICs orders for every $1.00 of product shipped. Total
OmniTRACS shipments were approximately 12 thousand units (cumulatively over
290,000).

License, Royalty and Development Fees
License, royalty and development fees for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 were
$93 million, including $6 million of license fees, compared to $77 million last
quarter and $47 million for the year ago quarter.

Contract Services
Contract services revenues were $88 million in the third quarter of fiscal 1999
compared to $70 million for the year ago quarter. The increase in revenues was
attributable to the development agreement with Globalstar, the activities of
which are expected to decline in future quarters.

Operating Income/Expenses
Operating income excluding non-recurring charges more than quadrupled,
increasing 303 percent to $215 million in the third quarter of fiscal 1999
compared to $53 million during the year ago quarter. The increase was
attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins in all product areas
with the exception of infrastructure products. Operating

income as a percent of revenues more than tripled, increasing to 21 percent for
the third quarter of fiscal 1999 from 6 percent in the year ago quarter.
Operating expenses (research and development, selling and marketing and general
and administrative) excluding non-recurring charges for the third quarter of
fiscal 1999 decreased to 20 percent of revenues compared to 23 percent of
revenues during the year ago quarter.

Taxes
The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 is currently estimated to be 35
percent compared to an effective tax rate of 30 percent in fiscal 1998. The
effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 may increase as a result of higher earnings
relative to investment tax credits.
