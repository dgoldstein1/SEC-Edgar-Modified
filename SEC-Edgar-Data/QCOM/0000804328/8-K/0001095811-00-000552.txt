ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

        On March 1, 2000, QUALCOMM Incorporated, a Delaware corporation
("QUALCOMM") completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock
of SnapTrack, Inc., a California corporation ("SnapTrack"). The acquisition was
effected pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization dated January 25, 2000 by and among QUALCOMM, Falcon Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM
("Merger Sub") and SnapTrack, whereby Merger Sub was merged with and into
SnapTrack (the "Merger"), with SnapTrack being the surviving corporation in the
Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM. In addition, QUALCOMM assumed
all of the outstanding options and warrants to purchase capital stock of
SnapTrack in connection with the Merger and such options and warrants are now
exercisable for shares of QUALCOMM Common Stock. The Merger is intended to
qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and will be accounted for as a
"purchase." For a detailed description of the terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement, reference is made to such agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 2.1
hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

        As a result of the Merger, QUALCOMM is obligated to issue up to
7,433,792 shares of its Common Stock to the securityholders of SnapTrack;
provided however, that 10% of the total shares will be subject to an escrow for
a period of one year (which one-year period could be extended in the event any
claims are made) to satisfy the indemnification obligations of the SnapTrack
securityholders that run in favor of QUALCOMM and its affiliates.

        Certain stockholders of SnapTrack who are entitled to receive an
aggregate of 1,949,509 shares of QUALCOMM Common Stock in the Merger have
executed lock-up agreements that impose certain limitations on such
stockholders' ability to sell or otherwise transfer such shares. For a detailed
description of the terms and conditions of the lock-up agreements, reference is
made to such agreements, which are filed as Exhibits 2.2 through 2.5 hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.

                              AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
                            MERGER AND REORGANIZATION


        THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is
made and entered into as of January 25, 2000, by and among: QUALCOMM
INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); FALCON ACQUISITION CORPORATION,
a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub");
and SNAPTRACK, INC., a California corporation (the "Company"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

                                    RECITALS

        A. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of
Merger Sub into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance with this Agreement and
the California General Corporation Law (the "CGCL"). Upon consummation of the
Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.

        B. It is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code").

        C. This Agreement has been approved by the respective boards of
directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and has been adopted by Parent,
as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub.

        D. In connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain shareholders of the Company are executing and delivering to Parent (i)
certain Voting Agreements of even date herewith regarding, among other things,
the voting of such shareholders' shares of Company capital stock; (ii) certain
Noncompetition Agreements whereby such shareholders have agreed to refrain from
engaging in certain competitive activities; and (iii) certain Lock-Up Agreements
whereby such shareholders have agreed to certain restrictions on the transfer of
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be received by such shareholder in the
Merger.

                                    AGREEMENT

        The parties to this Agreement agree as follows:

and simultaneously with or as soon as practicable following the Closing filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of California, along with appropriate

Certificates"), and (ii) a certificate of merger satisfying the applicable
requirements of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Delaware Certificate
of Merger") shall be duly executed by the Company and simultaneously with or as
soon as practicable following the Closing filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the latest of: (a)
the date and time of the filing of the California Agreement of Merger and the
Officers' Certificates with the Secretary of State of the State of California,
or (b) such other date and time as may be specified in the California Agreement
of Merger (such latest date being referred to as the "Effective Time").

        1.4 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS; DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Unless
otherwise determined by Parent prior to the Effective Time:

               (a) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Company as in effect as of the
date hereof;

               (b) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the Bylaws
of the Company as in effect as of the date hereof; and

               (c) the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time shall be the individuals who shall be the
officers and directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time.

        1.5 CONVERSION OF SHARES.

               (a) Subject to Sections 1.8(a), 1.9 and 1.10, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company:

                      (i) each share of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive that fraction of a share of the common stock, par value $.0001 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal to the "Exchange Ratio" (as
defined in Section 1.5(c)(i)), it being understood that certain of the shares


                                       2.


<PAGE>   10
of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1.5(a)(i) shall be held
in escrow in accordance with Section 1.10;

                      (ii) each share of Company Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to
receive that fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock equal to (A) that number
of shares of Company Common Stock into which each such share of Company
Preferred Stock is convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time,
multiplied by (B) the Exchange Ratio, it being understood that certain of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Section 1.5(a)(ii) shall
be held in escrow in accordance with Section 1.10; and

                      (iii) each share of the common stock of Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

               (b) In the event that any Company Options (as defined in Section
2.3(b)) assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 1.6 that are cancelled or expire
unexercised within 355 days of the Closing Date (the "Expired Options"), a
certificate representing the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
underlying such Expired Options shall be delivered to and in the name of the
Escrow Agent (as defined in Section 1.10) and such shares shall be deemed for
all purposes to be Escrow Shares (as defined in Section 1.10). Upon the
expiration of the Escrow Period (as defined in Section 1.10), the shares of
Parent Common Stock underlying the Expired Options that were placed in escrow
will be distributed to the holders of Company securities in accordance with the
same procedures as all other Escrow Shares; provided however, that the portion
of the Escrow Shares comprised of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying
Expired Options that are allocable to any Company Options or Company Warrants
that have not been exercised as of the Expiration of the Escrow Period, shall
not be distributed to the holders of such Company Options or Company Warrants
and shall instead be retired and returned to Parent as authorized and unissued
shares of Common Stock of Parent. Without limiting the foregoing, no holder of
Company Options or Company Warrants shall be entitled to receive any Escrow
Shares relating to such Company Options or Company Warrants (including the
shares of Parent Common Stock underlying the Expired Options that were placed in
escrow) until such time as such Company Options or Company Warrants are
exercised.

               (c) For purposes of this Agreement:

                      (i) The "Exchange Ratio" shall be determined by dividing
(A) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $1,000,000,000 less the Excess
Expenses (as defined in Section 11.3), if any, set forth on the Closing Expenses
Statement (as defined in Section 5.13), by (2) the Average Trading Price (as
defined in the next sentence), by (B) the Fully Diluted Company Share Amount.
The "Average Trading Price" shall be the average of the closing sales prices for
one share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the 15
consecutive trading days ending (and including) one day prior to the Closing
Date; provided, that if the Average Trading Price is equal to or greater than
$172.50, then the Average Trading Price shall be $172.50; provided further, that
if the Average Trading Price is equal to or less than $127.50, the Average
Trading Price shall be $127.50. If, between the date of this Agreement and the


                                       3.


<PAGE>   11
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares or other similar transaction,
then the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted.

                      (ii) The "Fully Diluted Company Share Amount" shall be the
sum of (A) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any such shares that are
subject to a repurchase option or risk of forfeiture under any restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement), (B) the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to all
Company Options and all Company Warrants (as defined in Section 2.3(b))
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (C) the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock into which the shares of Company Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time would be convertible, and
(D) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock issuable pursuant to warrants, convertible securities and any other rights
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                      (iii) The "Merger Consideration" receivable by a holder of
capital stock of the Company shall consist of (i) the shares of Parent Common
Stock (other than Escrow Shares (as defined in Section 1.10)) issuable to such
holder in accordance with Section 1.5(a) upon the surrender of the certificate
or certificates representing capital stock of the Company held by such holder,
(ii) the rights of such holder with respect to the Escrow Shares held by the
Escrow Agent on behalf of such holder, and (iii) the right of such holder to
receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance
with Section 1.8(a).

                      (iv) The "Merger Shares" shall mean the (1) shares of
Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5(a)(i) and Section
1.5(a)(ii), plus (2) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of all Company Options and Company Warrants.

               (d) If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock
purchase agreement or other agreement with the Company, then the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock
will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition, and the certificates representing such shares of
Parent Common Stock may accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The
Company shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and
after the Effective Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase
option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement
or other agreement.

        1.6 COMPANY OPTIONS AND COMPANY WARRANTS.

               (a) At the Effective Time, each then outstanding Company Option,
Company Warrant, and each other outstanding option to purchase Common Stock of
the Company issued


                                       4.


<PAGE>   12
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, whether vested or unvested,
shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the
date of this Agreement) of such Company Stock Option Plan under which such
Company Option was issued and the stock option agreement or warrant agreement by
which such Company Option or Company Warrant is evidenced. Subject to the escrow
provisions set forth in Section 1.10, all rights with respect to Company Common
Stock and Company Preferred Stock under outstanding Company Options and Company
Warrants shall thereupon be converted into rights with respect to Parent Common
Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, (a) each Company Option
and Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of
Parent Common Stock, (b) subject to any adjustments contemplated by this Section
1.6(a), Sections 1.6(b) and 1.6(c), the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
subject to each such assumed Company Option and Company Warrant shall be equal
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that
were subject to such Company Option or Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (c) the per share exercise price for
the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such assumed Company
Option or Company Warrant shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock subject to such Company
Option or Company Warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise price to the nearest
whole cent, and (d) all restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed
Company Option and Company Warrant shall continue in full force and effect, and
the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such Company
Option and Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided however,
that each such assumed Company Option and Company Warrant shall, in accordance
with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other
similar transaction effected by Parent after the Effective Time; and provided
further, however, that in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of
the Code applies, the exercise price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant
to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be
determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. In addition to
any adjustment made at the Effective Time as provided for above, the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of a Company Option or
a Company Warrant shall be further adjusted and increased as of the end of the
Escrow Period by that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying
such Company Option or Company Warrant, multiplied by (2) the quotient obtained
by dividing (A) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock underlying
all of the Expired Options that were not distributed at the end of the Escrow
Period pursuant to Section 1.5(b), if any, by (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock issuable under the Company Options and Company Warrants
that are outstanding as of the end of the Escrow Period (assuming such Company
Options and Company Warrants had been outstanding as of the Effective Time).

               (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to
contrary, (i) no shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued with respect to
Company Options and Company Warrants assumed by Parent pursuant to Section
1.6(a) until the exercise of such options or warrants, and (ii) in the event
that any Company Options or Company Warrants assumed by


                                       5.


<PAGE>   13
Parent pursuant to Section 1.6(a) are exercised prior to the end of the Escrow
Period, the holder of such Company Options or Company Warrants shall be entitled
to receive 90% of the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Company
Options or Company Warrants and the remaining 10% of the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such Company Options or Company Warrants shall be placed in
escrow in accordance with Section 1.10 and shall be deemed for all purposes to
be Escrow Shares.

               (c) In the event an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9 of this Agreement, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable upon the exercise of any Company Options or Company Warrants
shall be adjusted pro rata based upon the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to which the Indemnitee is entitled.

               (d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
register with the SEC the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of the Company Options on a Form S-8 registration statement and shall use its
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein)
for so long as any of such options remain outstanding and unexercised. Parent
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company
Options and Company Warrants assumed in accordance with this Section 1.6. The
Company and Parent shall take all action that may be necessary (under all
Company Stock Option Plans and otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 1.6.

        1.7 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time,
holders of certificates representing shares of capital stock of the Company that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock of the
Company outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of capital stock of the Company shall be made on such stock
transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
certificate previously representing any shares of capital stock of the Company
(a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged
as provided in Section 1.8.

        1.8 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

               (a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent will
send to each of the registered holders of Company Stock Certificates a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Company Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Company Stock Certificate to Parent for exchange, together with a
duly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may be
reasonably required by Parent, Parent shall (i) deliver to the holder of such
Company Stock Certificate a certificate representing 90% of the shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5,
and (ii) deliver to the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement (as defined in
Section 1.10) on behalf of such holder a certificate in the name of the Escrow
Agent representing


                                       6.


<PAGE>   14
10% of the total number of shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.5, provided that the certificates
representing Parent Common Stock to be delivered to the holder of a Company
Stock Certificate under clause (i) above and to the Escrow Agent under clause
(ii) above shall, in each case, represent only whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and in lieu of any fractional shares to which such holder would otherwise
be entitled, the holder of such Company Stock Certificate shall be paid in cash
an amount equal to the sum of (1) the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) determined by multiplying the Average Trading Price by the fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be deliverable to such
holder under clause (i) above and (2) the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
whole cent) determined by multiplying the Average Trading Price by the fraction
of a share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be deliverable to the
Escrow Agent under clause (ii) above. In the event two or more Company Stock
Certificates represent shares of Company Common Stock by any holder, all
calculations respecting the number of shares and amount of cash to be delivered
to the holder and the Escrow Agreement shall be made based on the aggregate
number of shares represented by such Company Stock Certificates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Parent may deliver to the Escrow Agent one certificate
representing the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be held in
escrow pursuant to this Section 1.8(a) in lieu of issuing separate certificates
representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each holder
of Company capital stock pursuant to Section 1.5(a) to be held in escrow. All
Company Stock Certificates so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered
as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each Company Stock Certificate shall be
deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. If any
Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent may,
in its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of any
certificate representing Parent Common Stock or the payment of cash in lieu of
fractional shares, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company
Stock Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate.

               (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with
respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash
payment in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any such holder, until
such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with this
Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled to receive all such
dividends and distributions and such cash payment).

               (c) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to
any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be required to
deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

               (d) Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable
to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company for any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for
any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

        1.9 DISSENTING SHARES.

               (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the Effective
Time, are or may become "dissenting shares" within the meaning of Section
1300(b) of the CGCL shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5 (or cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.8(a)), and the holder or holders
of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such
holder or holders in Chapter 13 of the CGCL; provided, however, that if the
status of any such shares as "dissenting shares" shall not be perfected, or if
any such shares shall lose their status as "dissenting shares," then, as of the
later of the Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status or
the loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and
shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate
or certificates representing such shares) the Merger Consideration in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section
1.5 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.8(a)).

               (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demand received by the Company prior to the Effective Time to require
the Company to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company pursuant to
Chapter 13 of the CGCL and of any other demand, notice or instrument delivered
to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the CGCL, and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand
unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement
offer.

        1.10 ESCROW OF PARENT COMMON STOCK. Upon the Closing, Parent shall
withhold (i) 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued to the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section 1.5, and (ii) upon exercise of any Company Options or
Company Warrants assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 1.6 at any time during
the Escrow Period, 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issued upon exercise of such Company Options and Company Warrants (such
aggregate number of shares withheld, along with 10% of any shares of Parent
Common Stock underlying Company Options and Company Warrants that have not yet
been exercised, being collectively referred to herein as the "Escrow Shares")
and deliver such shares to Harris Trust Company of California or such other
national bank or trust company mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company, as
escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent"), to be held by the Escrow Agent as collateral
to secure the rights of the Indemnitees under Section 9 hereof. The Escrow
Shares shall be held pursuant to the provisions of an escrow agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow
Shares will be represented by a certificate or certificates issued in the name
of the Escrow Agent and will be held by the Escrow Agent for a


                                       8.


<PAGE>   16
period of one year from the Closing Date (the "Escrow Period"); provided however
that in the event any Indemnitee has made a claim under Section 9 prior to the
end of the Escrow Period, then the Escrow Period shall continue with respect to
such claim until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event that
this Agreement is adopted by the Company's shareholders, then all such
shareholders shall, without any further act of any Company shareholder, be
deemed to have consented to and approved (i) the use of the Escrow Shares as
collateral to secure the rights of the Indemnitees under Section 9 in the manner
set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement; (ii) the appointment of the
Company Shareholders' Representative (as defined in Section 11.1) as the
representative under this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement of the Persons
receiving shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (whether pursuant to
Section 1.5, upon exercise of Company Options or Company Warrants or otherwise)
and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each such Person
(other than holders of dissenting shares); and (iii) the indemnification of the
Company Shareholders' Representatives by the Company shareholders contemplated
by the Escrow Agreement.

        1.11 TAX CONSEQUENCES. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Treasury Regulations.

        1.12 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent
with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of
Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in
the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

pursuant to which any Person has any right (whether or not currently
exercisable) to use, license or otherwise exploit any Company Proprietary Asset.

               (b) The Company has taken reasonable measures and precautions to
protect and maintain the confidentiality, secrecy and value of all material
Company Proprietary Assets (except Company Proprietary Assets whose value would
be unimpaired by disclosure). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
except as set forth in Part 2.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) all
current and former employees of the Company who are or were involved in, or who
have contributed to, the creation or development of any material Company
Proprietary Asset have executed and delivered to the Company an agreement
(containing no exceptions to or exclusions from the scope of its coverage) that
is substantially identical to the form of Confidential Information and Invention
Assignment Agreement previously delivered by the Company to Parent, and (ii) all
current and former consultants and independent contractors to the Company who
are or were involved in, or who have contributed to, the creation or development
of any material Company Proprietary Asset have executed and delivered to the
Company an agreement (containing no exceptions to or exclusions from the scope
of its coverage) that is substantially identical to the form of Consultant
Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement previously delivered
to Parent. No current or former employee, officer, director, shareholder,
consultant or independent contractor of or to the Company has any right, claim
or interest in or with respect to any Company Proprietary Asset.

               (c) Except as set forth in Part 2.9(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (i) all patents, trademarks, service marks and copyrights held by the
Company and that are material to its business are valid, enforceable and
subsisting; (ii) none of the Company Proprietary Assets and no Proprietary Asset
that is currently being developed by the Company (either by itself or with any
other Person) infringes, misappropriates or conflicts with any Proprietary Asset
owned or used by any other Person; (iii) none of the products that are or have
been designed, created, developed, assembled, manufactured or sold by the
Company is infringing, misappropriating or making any unlawful or unauthorized
use of any Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other Person, and none of such
products has at any time infringed, misappropriated or made any unlawful or
unauthorized use of, and the Company has not received any notice or other
communication (in writing or otherwise) of any actual, alleged, possible or
potential infringement, misappropriation or unlawful or unauthorized use of, any
Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other Person; and (iv) to the knowledge
of the Company, no other Person is


                                      16.

infringing, misappropriating or making any unlawful or unauthorized use of, and
no Proprietary Asset owned or used by any other Person infringes or conflicts
with, any material Company Proprietary Asset.

               (d) The Company Proprietary Assets constitute all the Proprietary
Assets necessary to enable the Company to conduct its business in the manner in
which such business has been or is being conducted. The Company has not (i)
licensed any of the material Company Proprietary Assets to any Person on an
exclusive basis, or (ii) entered into any covenant not to compete or Contract
limiting its ability to exploit fully any material Company Proprietary Assets or
to transact business in any market or geographical area or with any Person.

               (e) Except as set forth in Part 2.9(e)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has not disclosed or delivered to any Person,
or permitted the disclosure or delivery to any escrow agent or other Person, of
any Company Source Code. No event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition
exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of time) will, or could reasonably
be expected to, result in the disclosure or delivery to any Person of any
Company Source Code. Part 2.9(e)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Contract pursuant to which the Company has deposited or is
required to deposit with an escrowholder or any other Person any Company Source
Code, and further describes whether the execution of this Agreement or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby could reasonably be
expected to result in the release or disclosure of any Company Source Code.

               (f) To the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth in Part
2.9(f)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each computer, computer program
and other item of software (whether installed on a computer or on any other
piece of equipment, including firmware) that is owned, licensed or used by the
Company for its internal business operations is Year 2000 Compliant. Except as
set forth in Part 2.9(f)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, each computer
program and other item of software that has been designed, developed, sold,
licensed or otherwise made available to any Person by the Company is Year 2000
Compliant. Except as set forth in Part 2.9(f)(iii) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has conducted sufficient Year 2000 compliance testing for
each computer, computer program and item of software referred to in the
preceding two sentences to be able to determine whether such computer, computer
program and item of software is Year 2000 Compliant, and has obtained warranties
or other written assurances from each of its suppliers to the effect that the
products and services provided by such suppliers to the Company is Year 2000
Compliant. As used in this Section 2.9, "Year 2000 Compliant" means, with
respect to a computer, computer program or other item of software (i) the
functions, calculations, and other computing processes of the computer, program
or software (collectively, "Processes") perform in a consistent and correct
manner without interruption regardless of the date on which the Processes are
actually performed and regardless of the date input to the applicable computer
system; (ii) the computer, program or software accepts, calculates, compares,
sorts, extracts, sequences, and otherwise processes date inputs and date values,
and returns and displays date values, in a consistent and correct manner
regardless of the dates used; (iii) the computer, program or software accepts
and responds to year input, if any, in a manner that resolves any ambiguities as
to century in a defined, predetermined, and appropriate manner; (iv) the
computer, program or software stores and displays date information in ways that
are unambiguous as to the determination of the century; and (v) leap


                                      17.

years will be determined by the following standard (A) if dividing the year by 4
yields an integer, it is a leap year, except for years ending in 00, but (B) a
year ending in 00 is a leap year if dividing it by 400 yields an integer.

               (g) Except with respect to demonstration or trial copies, no
product, system, program or software module designed, developed, sold, licensed
or otherwise made available by the Company to any Person contains any "back
door," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "worm," "drop dead device," "virus" or other
software routines or hardware components designed to permit unauthorized access
or to disable or erase software, hardware or data without the consent of the
user.

its business in the manner in which its business is currently being conducted.

that have been incurred by the Company since the date of the Unaudited Interim

        2.14 TAX MATTERS.

               (a) All Tax Returns required to be filed by or on behalf of the

Returns filed since the Company's inception.

               (b) The Company Financial Statements fully accrue all actual and
contingent liabilities for Taxes with respect to all periods through the dates

disclose the dollar amount of such reserves to Parent at least three (3) days
prior to the Closing Date.

               (c) No Company Return relating to income Taxes has ever been

Parent accurate and complete copies of all audit reports and similar documents
(to which the Company has access) relating to the Company Returns. Except as set
forth in Part 2.14(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, no extension or waiver
of the limitation period applicable to any of the Company Returns has been
granted (by the Company or any other Person) that is still outstanding, and no
such extension or waiver has been requested from the Company.

               (d) Except as set forth in Part 2.14(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no claim or Proceeding is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
has been threatened against or with respect to the Company in respect of any
Tax. There are no unsatisfied liabilities for Taxes (including liabilities for
interest, additions to tax and penalties thereon and related expenses) with
respect to any notice of deficiency or similar document received by the Company
with respect to any Tax (other than liabilities for Taxes asserted under any
such notice of deficiency or similar document which are being contested in good
faith by the Company and with respect to which adequate reserves for payment
have been established). There are no liens for Taxes upon any of the assets of
the Company except liens for current Taxes not yet due and payable. The Company
has not entered into or become bound by any agreement or consent pursuant to
Section 341(f) of the Code. The Company has not been, and the Company will not

provision under state or foreign Tax laws as a result of transactions or events
occurring, or accounting methods employed, prior to the Closing.

expected to, give rise directly or indirectly to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G or Section 162 of the Code. The
Company is not, and has never been, a party to or bound by any tax indemnity
agreement, tax sharing agreement, tax allocation agreement or similar Contract.

               (f) The Company has not taken any action which would reasonably

               (b) Except as set forth in Part 2.15(b) of the Company Disclosure

of ERISA) for the benefit of Employees or former Employees (a "Pension Plan").

               (c) The Company maintains, sponsors or contributes only to those
employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, whether or
not excluded from coverage under specific Titles or Merger Subtitles of ERISA)

                                      22.

Code).

               (e) The Company is not required to be, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, has never been required to be, treated as a single employer with
any other Person under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or Section 414(b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code. The Company has never been a member of an "affiliated
service group" within the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code. To the
knowledge of the Company, the Company has never made a complete or partial
withdrawal from a multiemployer plan, as such term is defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal liability," as such term is defined in
Section 4201 of ERISA (without regard to subsequent reduction or waiver of such
liability under either Section 4207 or 4208 of ERISA).

               (f) The Company does not have any plan or commitment to create
any additional Welfare Plan or any Pension Plan, or to modify or change any
existing Welfare Plan or Pension Plan (other than to comply with applicable law)
in a manner that would affect any Employee.

               (g) Except as set forth in Part 2.15(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no Welfare Plan provides death, medical or health benefits (whether or
not insured) with respect to any current or former Employee after any such
Employee's termination of service (other than (i) benefit coverage mandated by
applicable law, including coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the
Code, (ii) deferred compensation benefits accrued as liabilities on the


                                      23.


<PAGE>   31
Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet, and (iii) benefits the full cost of which are
borne by current or former Employees (or the Employees' beneficiaries)).

               (h) With respect to each of the Welfare Plans constituting a
group health plan within the meaning of Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code, the
provisions of Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA") have been complied with in all
material respects.

               (i) Each of the Plans has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, including
but not limited to ERISA and the Code.

               (j) Each of the Plans intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination from the Internal
Revenue Service, and the Company is not aware of any reason why any such
determination letter should be revoked.

               (k) Except as set forth in Part 2.15(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, will result in any payment (including any bonus, golden
parachute or severance payment) to any current or former Employee or director of
the Company (whether or not under any Plan), or materially increase the benefits
payable under any Plan, or result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits.

               (l) Part 2.15(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a
list of all salaried employees of the Company as of the date of this Agreement,
and correctly reflects, in all material respects, their salaries, any other
compensation payable to them (including compensation payable pursuant to bonus,
deferred compensation or commission arrangements), their dates of employment and
their positions. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining
contract or other Contract with a labor union involving any of its Employees.
All of the Company's employees are "at will" employees.

               (m) Part 2.15(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies
each Employee who is not fully available to perform work because of disability
or other leave and sets forth the basis of such leave and the anticipated date
of return to full service.

               (n) The Company is in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Legal Requirements and Contracts relating to employment,
employment practices, wages, bonuses and terms and conditions of employment,
including employee compensation matters.

               (o) Except as set forth in Part 2.15(o) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company has good labor relations, and has no reason to believe
that (i) the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will materially adversely effect the Company's
labor relations, or (ii) any of the Company's employees intends to terminate his
or her employment with the Company.

        2.16 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. The Company is in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Environmental Laws, which compliance includes the
possession by the


                                      24.


<PAGE>   32
Company of all permits and other Governmental Authorizations required under
applicable Environmental Laws, and compliance with the terms and conditions
thereof. The Company has not received any notice or other communication (in
writing or otherwise), whether from a Governmental Body, citizens group,
employee or otherwise, that alleges that the Company is not in compliance with
any Environmental Law, and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no
circumstances that may prevent or interfere with the Company's compliance in all
material respects with any Environmental Law in the future. To the knowledge of
the Company, no current or prior owner of any property leased or controlled by
the Company has received any notice or other communication (in writing or
otherwise), whether from a Government Body, citizens group, employee or
otherwise, that alleges that such current or prior owner or the Company is not
in compliance with any Environmental Law. All Governmental Authorizations
currently held by the Company pursuant to Environmental Laws are identified in
Part 2.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. (For purposes of this Section
2.16: (i) "Environmental Law" means any federal, state, local or foreign Legal
Requirement relating to pollution or protection of human health or the
environment (including ambient air, surface water, ground water, land surface or

material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the

days, after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall solicit the written
consent of the Company shareholders to approve the principal terms of this

                                      35.


<PAGE>   43
Securities Act ("Rule 502"). Parent shall promptly furnish to the Company
information concerning Parent that may be required to satisfy the information
requirements of Rule 502 in connection with any action contemplated by this
Section 5.2. If any event relating to any party hereto occurs, or if any party
hereto becomes aware of any information, in either case that should be disclosed
in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, then such party
shall promptly inform the others thereof and the Company, with the assistance of
such other parties, shall prepare and distribute such amendment or supplement to
the shareholders of the Company. Each party shall take all actions necessary or
advisable to exempt the issuance of the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger under Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. In
connection with the distribution of the Information Statement to the Company
shareholders, the Company shall include, and shall use its best efforts to cause
each Company shareholder to complete and return, an investor status
questionnaire in a form provided by Parent (the "Status Letter"), which form
will require each Company shareholder who is not an "accredited investor" (as
defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act ("Rule
501")) to agree to be represented by a "purchaser representative" (as defined in
Rule 501) in connection with evaluating the merits and risks if investing in
Parent Common Stock.

               (b) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals and other information
(including obtaining properly completed Status Letters from each Company
shareholder) needed to ensure that the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger will be registered or qualified under the securities law of every
jurisdiction of the United States in which any registered holder of capital
stock of the Company has an address of record on the record date for determining
the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote on the principal terms of
this Agreement and the Merger; provided however, that Parent shall not be
required (i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now qualified, or (ii) to file a general consent
to service of process in any jurisdiction.

               (c) The Company shall take all action necessary under all
applicable Legal Requirements to solicit the written consent of the shareholders
of the Company entitled to vote upon the principal terms of this Agreement and
the Merger and will, within thirty days of the date of this Agreement, mail to
each holder of capital stock of the Company a copy of the Information Statement,
a form of written consent, a Status Letter and such other documents as Parent
deems are necessary to comply with applicable law or are otherwise reasonably
appropriate. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
ensure that the Required Company Shareholder Vote will be obtained as promptly
as practicable after the Information Statement is first sent to the shareholders
of the Company. The Company shall ensure that the Required Company Shareholder
Vote is obtained in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements.

               (d) The board of directors of the Company shall unanimously
recommend that the Company's shareholders approve the principal terms of this
Agreement and the Merger. The Information Statement shall include a statement to
such effect. Neither the board of directors of the Company nor any committee
thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw,
amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the unanimous recommendation of
the board of directors of the Company that the Company's shareholders approve
the principal


                                      36.


<PAGE>   44
terms of this Agreement and the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, said

                      (i) the discovery by such party of any event, condition,
fact or circumstance that occurred or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement and that caused or constitutes an inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement;

                      (ii) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that
occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement and that would cause
or constitute an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made
by such party in this Agreement if (A) such representation or warranty had been
made as of the time of the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event,
condition, fact or circumstance, or (B) such event, condition, fact or
circumstance had occurred, arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this
Agreement;

                      (iii) any breach of any covenant or obligation of such
party; and

                      (iv) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would
make the timely satisfaction of any condition set forth in Section 6 or Section
7 impossible or unlikely.

               (b) If any event, condition, fact or circumstance that is
required to be disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(a) above requires any change in
the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case
may be, or if any such event, condition, fact or circumstance would require such
a change assuming the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as the case may be, were dated as of the date of the occurrence,
existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or circumstance, then the
Company shall promptly deliver to Parent an update to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, or Parent shall deliver to the Company an update to the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, specifying such change. No such update
shall be deemed to supplement or amend the Company Disclosure Schedule or the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, for the purpose of (i)
determining the accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, in this Agreement, or (ii)
determining whether any condition set forth in Section 6 or 7, as the case may
be, has been satisfied.

        5.4 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. During the Pre-Closing Period, (a) the Company
shall not (and the Company shall not permit any of its Representatives to) issue
any press release or make any public statement regarding this Agreement or the
Merger, or regarding any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, without Parent's prior written consent, and (b) Parent will use
reasonable efforts to consult with the Company prior to issuing any press
release or making any public statement regarding the Merger and to consider in
good faith any suggestions or concerns raised by the Company, provided that
nothing herein shall be deemed to

prohibit Parent from making any public disclosure Parent deems necessary or

addressed in such letters are factually correct. Neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor
the Company will take any action, or will fail to take any action, either before
or after the Closing of the Merger, which could reasonably be expected to cause
the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the
Code. Parent shall report, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to report,
the Merger for federal income tax purposes as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

may substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or policies of comparable
coverage, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an
annual premium for the Existing Policy (or for any substitute policies) in
excess of $75,000. In the event any future annual premium for the Existing

any substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for an
annual premium equal to $75,000.

accordance with Section 11.3.

5.14. Further, until such time that the continuing Company employees are covered

applicable law, Parent also agrees to provide each such continuing employee with
full credit for service as an employee of the Company or any affiliate thereof
prior to the Effective Time for the following purposes only: for purposes of

to be authorized for listing on Nasdaq.

        5.16 WORKING CAPITAL LOAN. Subject to the last sentence of this Section
5.16, in the event the Merger fails to close for any reason (other than as the
result of a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(a))
and the Company requires additional working capital funds, Parent shall, at the
request of the Company made within 60 days of the date of the termination of
this Agreement, loan to the Company, when and as needed, on a mutually agreeable

provided by the Company to Parent when the request for the loan is made. Parent

and warranties, (i) all "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other

SECTION 8. TERMINATION

        8.1 TERMINATION EVENTS. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the
Closing:

               (a) by Parent if (i) any of the Company's representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate as of the date of
this Agreement, or shall have become inaccurate as of a date subsequent to the
date of this Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date), such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.1 would not be satisfied (it being understood
that, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such representations and
warranties as of the date of this Agreement or at any subsequent date, (A) all
"Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and other materiality qualifications,
and any similar qualifications, contained in such representations and warranties
shall be disregarded and (B) any update of or modification to the Company

breach or inaccuracy that is curable by the Company unless the Company fails to
cure such inaccuracy or breach within 30 days after receiving written notice

qualifications and other materiality qualifications, and any similar
qualifications, contained in such representations and warranties shall be
disregarded and (B) any update of or modification to the Parent Disclosure
Schedule made or purported to have been made after the date of this Agreement
shall be disregarded), or (ii) any of Parent's covenants contained in this
Agreement shall have been breached such that the condition set forth in Section
7.2 would not be satisfied; provided, however, that the Company shall not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) on account of any breach or
inaccuracy that is curable by Parent unless Parent fails to cure such inaccuracy
or breach within 30 days after receiving written notice from the Company of such
inaccuracy or breach;

               (c) by either Parent or the Company if the Closing has not taken
place on or before March 15, 2000 (the "Termination Date") (unless the failure
to consummate the Merger is attributable to a failure on the part of the party
seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform any material obligation required
to be performed by such party at or prior to the Effective Time); provided
however that if a request for additional information is received from the
Federal Trade Commission of the United States Department of Justice under the
HSR Act, such date shall be extended to the 60th day following acknowledgement
by such Governmental Body that Parent and the Company have complied with such
request, but in no event shall such date be extended to a date after July 31,
2000;

               (d) by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent

having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the Merger;

               (e) by the mutual consent of Parent and the Company; or

               (f) by Parent in the event the Federal Trade Commission or the
Department of Justice fails to grant the requisite approvals to the Merger under

        8.2 TERMINATION PROCEDURES. If Parent wishes to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(a), Section 8.1(c), Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(f),
Parent shall deliver to the Company a written notice stating that Parent is
terminating this Agreement and setting forth a brief description of the basis on
which Parent is terminating this Agreement. If the Company wishes to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section 8.1(c), or Section 8.1(d),
the Company shall deliver to Parent a written notice stating that the Company is
terminating this Agreement and setting forth a brief description of the basis on
which the Company is terminating this Agreement.

        8.3 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall
terminate; provided, however, that: (a) neither the Company nor Parent shall be
relieved of any obligation or liability arising from any willful or intentional
inaccuracy or prior willful or intentional breach by such party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other provision of this Agreement; (b) the
parties shall, in all events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the
provisions set forth in Section 11; (c) Parent shall, in all events, remain

subject to Section 5.17. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the
event Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(f) and elects to

upon the execution of the License Agreement by Parent and the Company.

SECTION 9. INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

        9.1 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, ETC.

               (a) The representations and warranties made by the Company
(including the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2 and the
representations set forth in the Company Compliance Certificate) shall survive
the Closing and shall expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date;
provided, however, that if, at any time prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, any Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the Company
Shareholders' Representative a written notice alleging the existence of an
inaccuracy in or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
Indemnitee's belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and asserting a
claim for recovery under Section 9.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach,
then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the first anniversary of
the Closing until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. All
representations and warranties made by Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and
expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and any liability of Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to such representations and warranties shall
thereupon cease.

               (b) The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of
the Company, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the
Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any
information furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of
the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

               (c) For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or other item
of information set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in any update to
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

        9.2 INDEMNIFICATION. From and after the Closing Date (but subject to
Section 9.1(a)), each Indemnitee shall be held harmless and indemnified from and
against, and shall be compensated, reimbursed and paid for, any Damages which
are directly or indirectly suffered or incurred by any Indemnitee or to which
any Indemnitee may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any third-party claim) and which arise from or as a result of,
or are directly or indirectly connected with: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement
(without giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality
qualification or any similar qualification contained or incorporated directly or
indirectly in such representation or warranty, and without giving effect to any
update to the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to


                                      47.


<PAGE>   55
Parent prior to the Closing) or in the Company Compliance Certificate; (ii) any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
this Agreement (without giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect" or other
materiality qualification or any similar qualification contained or incorporated
directly or indirectly in such representation or warranty, and without giving
effect to any update to the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company
to Parent prior to the Closing) or in the Company Compliance Certificate as if
such representation or warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date, (iii)
any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company (including the covenants
set forth in Sections 4 and 5); (iv) any Excess Expenses incurred by the Company
or the Surviving Corporation which were not reflected on the Closing Expenses
Statement; (v) any infringement claims or Legal Proceedings made or brought by
any Person relating to any patents or patent applications set forth, identified
or otherwise referred to in Part 2.9(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
"Part 2.9(c) Claims"); or (vi) any amounts owed by the Company to Aisys in
excess of $77,000 as a result of the DoCoMo transaction.

        9.3 THRESHOLD. No Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2 (other than claims to indemnification under Sections
9.2(iv), 9.2(v) and 9.2(vi), to which claims the limitations contained in this
Section 9.3 shall not apply) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
Company's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement or the
Company Compliance Certificate until such time as the total amount of all
Damages (including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach and all
other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies in or breaches of any
representations or warranties) that have been directly or indirectly suffered or
incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or more of
the Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds $1,000,000 in the
aggregate, provided that if the total amount of such Damages exceeds $1,000,000,
then any Indemnitee that has suffered or incurred any Damages shall be entitled
to be indemnified against and compensated, reimbursed and paid for all such
Damages and not merely that portion of such Damages that exceed $1,000,000.

        9.4 RIGHT OF OFFSET OF INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS. Subject to Section 9.3,
in the event any Indemnitee shall suffer any Damages for which such Indemnitee
is entitled to indemnification under this Section 9, such Indemnitee shall be
entitled, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, to recover such Damages
by obtaining that number of Escrow Shares equal in value (as determined in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement) to the
aggregate amount of such Damages, and, consistent with the terms of Section 9.9,
such recourse shall represent such Indemnitee's sole and exclusive right and
remedy in such event. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall be entitled
to offset against the Escrow Shares, and the Company Shareholders'
Representative shall not assert any defense with respect to any claims made
under Section 9.2(iv) for Excess Expenses.


                                      48.


<PAGE>   56
        9.5 TREATMENT OF PART 2.9(c) CLAIMS.

               (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event an Indemnitee suffers or incurs any Damages to which
Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification under Section 9.2(v), then the
following shall apply:

                      (i) With respect to the first $25,000,000 in any such
Damages, Parent shall be entitled to offset 90% of any such Damages against the
Escrow Shares and Parent shall be liable for the remaining 10% of any such
Damages;

                      (ii) With respect to the next $25,000,000 in any such
Damages, Parent shall be entitled to offset 10% of any such Damages against the
Escrow Shares and Parent shall be liable for the remaining 90% of any such
Damages; and

                      (iii) With respect to any such Damages that exceed
$50,000,000, Parent shall be entitled to offset 50% of any such Damages against
the Escrow Shares to the full extent of all Escrow Shares then available in
escrow and Parent shall be liable for the remaining 50% of any such Damages.

               (b) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person
of Part 2.9(c) Claim (whether against the Surviving Corporation, against Parent
or against any other Person) with respect to which any of the Indemnitees may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(v), Parent shall have the
right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of such Part 2.9(c) Claim on
its own. In addition, Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or
compromise any such Part 2.9(c) Claim with the consent of either of the Company
Shareholders' Representatives; provided however, that such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If Parent determines to settle, adjust or compromise any
such Part 2.9(c) Claim, Parent shall deliver to the Company Shareholders'
Representatives a written statement of the terms of any such proposed
settlement, adjustment or compromise including the amount thereof (the
"Settlement Amount"). In the event that the Company Shareholders'
Representatives shall withhold consent and Parent proceeds with the defense of
such Part 2.9(c) Claim, then Parent shall be entitled to offset against the
Escrow Shares any Damages incurred by Parent in connection with any such Part
2.9(c) Claim.

               (c) Except to the extent specifically altered by this Section
9.5, Part 2.9(c) Claims shall be governed by the provisions of Section 9.7.

               (d) The limitations contained in Section 9.3 shall not apply to
the provisions of this Section 9.5.

        9.6 NO CONTRIBUTION. The Company shareholders shall not have and shall
not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Surviving
Corporation in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other
liability to which such shareholders may become subject under or in connection
with this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.


                                      49.


<PAGE>   57
        9.7 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against the
Surviving Corporation, against Parent or against any other Person) with respect
to which any of the Indemnitees may be entitled to indemnification or any other
remedy pursuant to this Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its election,
to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own. If
Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

               (a) all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim
or Legal Proceeding shall be satisfied out of the Escrow Shares in the manner
set forth in the Escrow Agreement; and

               (b) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise
such claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of the Company Shareholders'
Representative; provided, however, that such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

        Parent shall give the Company Shareholders' Representative prompt notice
of the commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation; provided, however, that any failure on the part of Parent to so
notify the Company Shareholders' Representative shall not limit any of the
Indemnitees' rights to indemnification under this Section 9 (except to the
extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding).
If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal
Proceeding, the Company Shareholders' Representative may proceed with the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Parent; provided, however, that the Company Shareholders' Representative may
not settle, adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld).

        9.8 EXERCISE OF REMEDIES BY INDEMNITEES OTHER THAN PARENT. No Indemnitee
(other than Parent or any successor thereto or assign thereof) shall be
permitted to assert any indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under
this Agreement or under the Escrow Agreement unless Parent (or any successor
thereto or assign thereof) shall have consented to the assertion of such
indemnification claim or the exercise of such other remedy.

        9.9 INDEMNIFICATION EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Except for claims based on fraud,
willful misconduct or other tortious conduct, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) recourse by an Indemnitee against the
Escrow Shares shall be the sole and exclusive right and remedy exercisable by
such Indemnitee with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto or noncompliance by the Company with any covenant contained in this
Agreement, and (ii) Parent shall not be entitled to pursue any claims for
indemnification under this Section 9 or other contractual damages arising out of
this Agreement against any of the former Company shareholders directly or
personally.

SECTION 10. REGISTRATION OF SHARES

        10.1 REGISTRATION STATEMENT.


                                      50.


<PAGE>   58
               (a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing (and in any
event within 20 days after the Closing), Parent shall file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-3 (the "First Registration Statement")
registering for resale the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant
to Sections 1.5(a)(i), 1.5(a)(ii) and upon the exercise of any Company Warrants
assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 1.6 (such shares of Parent Common Stock
being referred to collectively as the "First Registration Statement Shares").
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts: (a) to cause the First
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as
practicable after the Closing; and (b) cause the First Registration Statement to
remain effective until the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, or (ii) the date on which all of the First Registration Statement Shares
covered by the First Registration Statement have been sold.

               (b) As promptly as practicable after the end of the Escrow Period
(and in any event within 20 days after the end of the Escrow Period), Parent
shall file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Second
Registration Statement") registering for resale the shares of Parent Common
Stock underlying the Expired Options, if any (such shares being referred to as
the "Second Registration Statement Shares"). Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts: (a) to cause the Second Registration Statement to be
declared effective by the SEC as soon as practicable after the end of the Escrow
Period; and (b) cause the Second Registration Statement to remain effective
until the earlier of (i) the first anniversary of the end of the Escrow Period,
or (ii) the date on which all of the Second Registration Statement Shares
covered by the Second Registration Statement have been sold.

               (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, the First Registration
Statement and the Second Registration Statement shall collectively be referred
to herein as the "Registration Statements" and the First Registration Statement
Shares and the Second Registration Statement Shares shall collectively be
referred to herein as the "Registrable Securities." Parent shall (at its own
expense):

                      (i) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments to the
Registration Statements, and such supplements to the related prospectuses, as
may be required in order to comply with the applicable provisions of the
Securities Act;

                      (ii) promptly furnish to the holders of Registrable Shares
such numbers of copies of a prospectus conforming to the requirements of the
Securities Act as they may reasonably request in order to facilitate the
disposition of the Registrable Shares covered by the Registration Statements;
and

                      (iii) use reasonable efforts to register and qualify the
Registrable Shares under the securities laws of such states as the holders of
Registrable Shares may reasonably request, provided, however, that Parent shall
not be required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to
do business or to file a general consent to service of process in any of such
states.

               (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Person who receives Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall have any rights
under this Section 10 unless


                                      51.


<PAGE>   59
such Person (i) executes a written agreement satisfactory in form and content to
Parent, confirming that such Person wishes to be allowed to sell Parent Common
Stock pursuant to the Registration Statements and agrees to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 10, which written agreement shall be delivered to the
Company shareholders with the Information Statement contemplated by Section 5.2,
and (ii) delivers such written agreement (as executed by such Person) to Parent
within 10 days after the Closing. A Person who receives Registrable Shares in
the Merger pursuant to Section 1.5(a) and who executes and delivers such an
agreement is referred to in this Section 10 as a "Participating Holder."

               (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
all of Parent's obligations under this Section 10.1 (including its obligation to
file and maintain the effectiveness of the Registration Statements) shall
terminate and expire as to the earliest date on which all Registrable Shares can
be sold without registration pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act.

        10.2 INDEMNIFICATION.

               (a) Parent agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law,
each Participating Holder against all Damages suffered by such Participating
Holder as a result of any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact
contained in either of the Registration Statements or in the related
prospectuses or preliminary prospectuses (or in any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) or as a result of any omission or alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, except insofar as such untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or omission results from or is contained in any
information furnished in writing to Parent by such Participating Holder for use
therein or results from such Participating Holder's failure to deliver a copy of
the Registration Statements or related prospectuses (or any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto) after Parent has furnished such Participating Holder with a
sufficient number of copies thereof.

               (b) In connection with the Registration Statements, each
Participating Holder (i) shall furnish to Parent in writing such information and
affidavits as Parent reasonably requests for use in connection with such
Registration Statements or the related prospectuses, and (ii) to the extent
permitted by law, will indemnify Parent, its directors and officers and each
Person who controls Parent (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
all Damages resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material
fact contained in such Registration Statements or in the related prospectuses or
preliminary prospectuses (or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) or
from any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to
the extent that such untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission results from or is contained in any information or affidavit furnished
in writing by such Participating Holder.

               (c) Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 10
will (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with
respect to which it seeks indemnification, and (ii) unless in the indemnified
party's reasonable judgment a conflict of


                                      52.


<PAGE>   60
interest exists between the indemnified party and the indemnifying party with
respect to such claim, permit the indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party will not be subject to any
liability for any consent to the entry of any judgment or any settlement made by
the indemnified party without the indemnifying party's consent (but such consent
will not be unreasonably withheld). An indemnifying party who is not entitled
to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim will pay the fees and
expenses of only one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying
party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any
indemnified party a conflict of interest exists between such indemnified party
and any other indemnified party with respect to such claim (in which case the
indemnifying party will pay the fees and expenses of additional counsel).

        10.3 TRANSFERABILITY OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS. The rights of Participating
Holders under this Section 10 are not transferable except in connection with:
(a) a transfer by will or intestacy; and (b) estate planning transfers
consisting of gifts to the spouse or issue of the transferor, or to a charity
qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code: and (c) a distribution of any of
the Registrable Securities, without additional consideration, to the underlying
beneficial owners thereof (such as the general partners, limited partners,
shareholders or trust beneficiaries of a Company shareholder), in which event in
each such case such transferee or distributee shall be deemed to be a
"Participating Holder" for purposes of this Section 10 and shall be required to
comply with the provisions of Section 10.1(c).

        10.4 DELAY OF REGISTRATION. For a period not to exceed 60 days, Parent
may delay the filing or effectiveness of either of the Registration Statements,
or suspend the use of the Registration Statements (and the Participating Holders
hereby agree not to offer or sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to the
Registration Statements during such period) after receiving notice of such delay
or suspension), at any time when Parent, in its reasonable judgment after
consultation with counsel, believes that there is or may be in existence
material nonpublic information or events involving Parent, the failure of which
to be disclosed in the prospectus included in either of the Registration
Statements could result in a violation of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
or any provision of any state securities law (the "Suspension Right"). In the
event Parent exercises the Suspension Right, such suspension shall continue for
the period of time, and only such period of time, reasonably necessary for
disclosure to occur at a time that is not detrimental to Parent or its
stockholders or until such time as the information or event is no longer
material, each as determined in good faith by Parent after consultation with
counsel. Parent will promptly give the Participating Holders notice of any such
delay or suspension and prompt notice of the cessation of suspension or delay.
In the event Parent reasonably believes that any of the foregoing circumstances
are continuing after such 60-day period, it may, with the consent of the holders
of a majority of the Registrable Shares (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) extend such 60-day period for one additional 30-day period. Parent
will use all reasonable efforts to minimize the length of any suspension or
delay under this Section 10.4; provided however that nothing contained in this
Section 10.4 shall be deemed to require Parent to make any disclosures.

        10.5 AMENDMENT OF SECTION 10. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 10 may be amended by
Parent at any time with


                                      53.

the consent of the holders of a majority of the Registrable Shares (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

SECTION 11. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

        11.1 COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE. The shareholders of the
Company, by adopting this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
hereby irrevocably appoint Bruce W. Dunlevie and M. Kenneth Oshman as their
agents to act, jointly and severally, on their behalf for purposes of Section 9
and the Escrow Agreement (each a "Company Shareholders' Representative"). Parent
shall be entitled to deal exclusively with either Company Shareholders'
Representative on all matters relating to Section 9 and the Escrow Agreement,
and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Company shareholder by either Company Shareholders' Representative, and on
any other action taken or purported to be taken on behalf of any Company
shareholder by either Company Shareholders' Representative, as fully binding
upon such Company shareholder. The rights and obligations of such Company
Shareholders' Representatives shall be as set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

        11.2 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request (prior
to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

        11.3 FEES AND EXPENSES. Each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay
all fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and accounting fees) that
have been incurred or that are incurred by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by such party in connection with or by virtue of (a) the
investigation and review conducted by Parent and its Representatives with
respect to the Company's business (and the furnishing of information to Parent
and its Representatives in connection with such investigation and review), (b)
the negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement (including the Company
Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c) the preparation and submission
of any filing or notice required to be made or given in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the obtaining of any
Consent required to be obtained in connection with any of such transactions, and
(d) the consummation of the Merger; provided however, that, to the extent the
total amount of all such fees, costs and expenses incurred by or for the benefit
of the Company (including all such fees, costs and expenses incurred prior to
the date of this Agreement) exceeds $1,200,000 in the aggregate (any such amount
in excess of $1,200,000 being referred to as the "Excess Expenses"), such fees,
costs and expenses shall be paid and satisfied by reducing the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.5(a) by that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock determined by dividing (1) the total Excess
Expenses, by (2) the Average Trading Price (as defined in Section 1.8(a).

power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part
of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy
and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power,
right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim

extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

respective successors and assigns (if any).

        11.16 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement and the other agreements referred
to herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof; provided, however, that the mutual non-disclosure
agreement executed by Parent and the Company in connection with the Merger shall
not be superseded by this Agreement and shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms until the earlier of (a) the Effective Time, or (b) the date on
which such Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement is terminated in accordance with its
terms.

                                ESCROW AGREEMENT


<PAGE>   73
                                ESCROW AGREEMENT


        THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT is entered into as of March 1, 2000, by and among:
QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"); SNAPTRACK, INC., a
California corporation (the "Company"); HARRIS TRUST COMPANY OF CALIFORNIA (the
"Escrow Agent"); and BRUCE W. DUNLEVIE and M. KENNETH OSHMAN (each a "Company
Shareholders' Representative"). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings given them in the Merger Agreement (as
defined below).

                                    RECITALS

        A. Parent, Falcon Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent and the Company have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated as of January 25, 2000 (the "Merger
Agreement") pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company whereby the Company will be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

        B. The Merger Agreement provides that an escrow account will be
established as collateral for certain indemnification obligations owed to the
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9 of the Merger Agreement.

        C. The parties hereto desire to establish the terms and conditions
pursuant to which such escrow account will be established and maintained.

                                    AGREEMENT

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:

        1. ESCROW ACCOUNT.

               (a) ESCROW OF SHARES. At the time and date as of which the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are
required to take place ("Closing Date"), Parent shall deliver to the Escrow
Agent notification of the Closing Date and a certificate or certificates for
seven hundred forty-three thousand three hundred seventy-nine (743,379) shares
of Parent Common Stock ( the "Escrow Shares") to be issued in the name of the
Escrow Agent or its nominee. If prior to the end of one year from the Closing
Date (the "Escrow Period") any Company Options or Company Warrants assumed by
Parent in connection with the Merger are exercised, then Parent shall deliver to
the Escrow Agent an additional certificate or certificates representing 10% of
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon any such exercise to be
deposited into escrow and the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by any
such additional certificate or certificates shall be deemed for all purposes to
be Escrow Shares. In addition, on the date that is not later than 360 days after
the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to the Escrow Agent an additional
certificate representing all of the shares of Parent Common Stock underlying any
Expired Options and the shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such
additional certificate shall be deemed for all purposes to be Escrow Shares. The
Escrow Shares shall be held as an escrow fund and shall not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any creditor
of any party hereto. The Escrow Agent


                                       1.


<PAGE>   74
agrees to accept delivery of the Escrow Shares and to hold the Escrow Shares in
an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

               (b) DIVIDENDS, ETC. Any securities distributable in respect of or
in exchange for any of the Escrow Shares, whether by way of stock dividend,
stock splits or otherwise, shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent, who shall
hold such securities in the Escrow Account. Such securities shall be issued in
the name of the Escrow Agent or its nominee and shall be considered Escrow
Shares for all purposes hereof. Parent shall or shall cause any cash dividend or
property (other than securities) distributable in respect of the Escrow Shares
to be distributed to the Persons whom have an interest in the Escrow Shares (the
"Company Securityholders") at the addresses on file with Parent for such
Persons.

               (c) VOTING OF SHARES. On any matter brought before the
stockholders of Parent for a vote, the Company Shareholders' Representatives
shall deliver notice to the Escrow Agent ("Voting Notice") setting forth the
manner in which, in proportion to the votes cast by the Company Securityholders,
the Escrow Agent shall vote the Escrow Shares. Such Voting Notice shall be
delivered to the Escrow Agent at least five days prior to the date of the taking
of any vote of the stockholders of Parent (the "Voting Notice Date"). The Escrow
Agent shall have no obligation to vote any of the Escrow Shares if no Voting
Notice is received prior to the Voting Notice Date, if such notice does not
clearly set forth the manner in which the Escrow Agent shall vote the Escrow
Shares, or if such notice is disputed by either Company Shareholders'
Representative.

               (d) TRANSFERABILITY. The interests of the Company Securityholders
in the Escrow Shares shall not be assignable or transferable, other than by
operation of law. Notice of any such assignment or transfer by operation of law
shall be given to the Escrow Agent and Parent, and no such assignment or
transfer shall be valid until such notice is given.

               (e) ESCROW AGENT'S POWER TO TRANSFER. The Escrow Agent is hereby
granted the power to effect any transfer of the Escrow Shares permitted under
the terms of this Agreement. Parent will cooperate with the Escrow Agent in
causing Parent's transfer agent to promptly issue stock certificates to effect
such transfers.

               (f) ACTS OF COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVES. The Company
Shareholders' Representatives shall be entitled to act jointly or severally on
behalf of the Company Securityholders. Accordingly, all notices, certificates,
agreements, consents, instructions or other instruments required to be delivered
to Parent or the Escrow Agent by the Company Shareholders' Representatives may
be executed by either or both of the Company Shareholders' Representatives and
any notice, certificate, agreement, consent, instruction or other instrument
executed by a single Company Shareholders' Representative shall be deemed for
all purposes of this Agreement to be executed by both Company Shareholders'
Representatives. Parent and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any
act or omission to act of any Company Shareholder Representative (including any
notice, certificate, agreement, consent, instruction or other instrument
executed by a single Company Shareholder Representative) as the act or omission
to act of both Company Shareholders' Representatives. In the event that Parent
or the Escrow Agent receive any notice, certificate, agreement, consent,
instruction or other instrument from a Company Shareholders' Representative that
conflicts with


                                       2.


<PAGE>   75
any notice, certificate, agreement, consent, instruction or other instrument
received from the other Company Shareholders' Representative, neither Parent nor
the Escrow Agent shall have any obligation to conduct any investigation or
inquiry with respect thereto and Parent and the Escrow Agent may rely (without
any liability for such reliance) on either such notice, certificate, agreement,
consent, instruction or other instrument as the act of both of the Company
Shareholders' Representatives. Any notice, certificate, agreement, consent,
instruction or other instrument delivered by Parent or the Escrow Agent to
either Company Shareholders' Representative shall be deemed delivered to both
Company Shareholders' Representatives.

        2. ADMINISTRATION OF ESCROW ACCOUNT. The Escrow Agent shall administer
the Escrow Account as follows:

               (a) DELIVERY OF CLAIM NOTICE. If any Indemnitee has incurred or
suffered any Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification under
the Merger Agreement, the Parent shall, on behalf of such Indemnitee and on or
prior to the Termination Date (as defined below), give written notice of such
claim (a "Claim Notice") to either Company Shareholders' Representative and the
Escrow Agent. Each Claim Notice shall state the basis for such claim, the amount
of Damages incurred or suffered by such Indemnitee and the number of Escrow
Shares corresponding to said Damages (the "Claimed Amount"). No Indemnitee shall
make any claim for Damages after February 29, 2001 (the "Termination Date").

               (b) RESPONSE NOTICE; UNCONTESTED CLAIMS. Within 30 days of the
date a Claim Notice was received by the Escrow Agent (the "Response Date"),
either or both of the Company Shareholders' Representatives shall provide to
Parent and to the Escrow Agent a written response (the "Response Notice") in
which the Company Shareholders' Representatives shall: (i) agree that the number
of Escrow Shares stated in the Claim Notice and having a Fair Market Value (as
calculated pursuant to Section 4 hereof) equal to the full Claimed Amount may be
released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee, (ii) agree that a stated
number of Escrow Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to part, but not all,
of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") may be released from the Escrow
Account to the Indemnitee or (iii) contest that any of the Escrow Shares may be
released from the Escrow Account to the Indemnitee. The Company Shareholders'
Representatives may contest the release of Escrow Shares having a Fair Market
Value equal to all or a portion of a Claimed Amount only based upon a good faith
belief that all or such portion of the Claimed Amount does not constitute
Damages for which the Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under the Merger
Agreement. If no Response Notice is delivered by the Company Shareholders'
Representatives to the Escrow Agent by the Response Date, the Company
Shareholders' Representatives shall be deemed to have agreed that Escrow Shares
having a Fair Market Value equal to the entire Claimed Amount may be released to
the Indemnitee from the Escrow Account.

               (c) UNCONTESTED CLAIM. If either of the Company Shareholders'
Representatives in the Response Notice agrees or is deemed pursuant to the last
sentence of subsection (b) above to have agreed that Escrow Shares having a Fair
Market Value equal to the Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account
to the Indemnitee, the Escrow Agent shall, no later than ten days after receipt
of the Response Notice, transfer, deliver, and assign to such Indemnitee such
number of Escrow Shares stated in the Claim Notice (or such lesser number of
Escrow Shares as is then held in the Escrow Account).


                                       3.


<PAGE>   76
               (d) PARTIALLY CONTESTED CLAIMS. If either of the Company
Shareholders' Representatives in the Response Notice agree that a stated amount
of Escrow Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount may be released from the Escrow Account to such Indemnitee, the
Escrow Agent shall, no later than ten days after receipt of the Response Notice,
transfer, deliver and assign to such Indemnitee such number of Escrow Shares as
set forth in the Response Notice (or such lesser number of Escrow Shares as is
then held in the Escrow Account).

               (e) CONTESTED CLAIMS.

                      (i) If both of the Company Shareholders' Representatives
in the Response Notice contest the release of all or part of the Escrow Shares
having a Fair Market Value equal to all or part of the Claimed Amount (the
"Contested Amount"), the Company Shareholders' Representatives and Parent shall
attempt in good faith for a period of up to 30 days to agree upon the rights of
the respective parties with respect to the claims at issue. If the Company
Shareholders' Representatives and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by Parent and either of the
Company Shareholders' Representatives and shall be furnished to the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon such memorandum and
distribute the Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account in accordance with the
terms of the memorandum.

                      (ii) If no such agreement can be reached after such good
faith negotiation, either Parent or both of the Company Shareholders'
Representatives may, by written notice to the other (with a copy to the Escrow
Agent), demand arbitration of the matter unless the Contested Amount is at issue
in pending litigation or other dispute resolution procedure with a third party,
in which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is
ascertained or both Parent and the Company Shareholders' Representatives agree
to early arbitration of the matter. All arbitration proceedings contemplated by
this subsection (e) shall be held in San Diego or San Francisco, California. All
claims shall be settled by three arbitrators in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the
"Rules"). The Company Shareholders' Representatives and Parent shall each
designate one arbitrator within 15 days of the delivery of the Response Notice
contesting the Claimed Amount. Such designated arbitrators shall mutually agree
upon and shall designate a third arbitrator; provided however, that (i) in the
event the two designated arbitrators fail to reach agreement with respect to the
designation of the third arbitrator within 15 days of delivery of the Response
Notice, the third arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the Rules and
(ii) if either the Company Shareholders' Representatives or Parent fail to
timely designate an arbitrator, the dispute shall be resolved by the one
arbitrator timely designated. There shall be limited discovery prior to the
arbitration hearing, subject to the discretion of the arbitrators, as follows:
(a) exchange of witness lists and copies of documentary evidence and documents
related to or arising out of the issues to be arbitrated, (b) depositions of all
party witnesses, and (c) such other depositions as may be allowed by the
arbitrators upon a showing of good cause. Depositions shall be conducted in
accordance with the California Code of Civil Procedure. The arbitrators shall
decide the matter to be arbitrated pursuant hereto within 60 days after the
appointment of the last arbitrator. The arbitrators' decision shall relate
solely to (i) whether Parent is entitled to receive the Contested Amount (or a
portion thereof) pursuant to the applicable terms of the Merger Agreement and
this Agreement, and (ii) which party shall be deemed to be the


                                       4.


<PAGE>   77
"prevailing party" in arbitration for the purposes of subparagraph (iii) below.
The final decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be furnished to the
Company Shareholders' Representatives, Parent and the Escrow Agent in writing
and shall constitute a conclusive determination of the issue in question,
binding upon the Company Shareholders' Representatives, the Company
Securityholders, the Company, Parent and the Escrow Agent and shall not be
contested by any of them. Such decision may be used in a court of law only for
the purpose of seeking enforcement of the arbitrators' award. After delivery of
a Response Notice that the Claimed Amount is contested by both of the Company
Shareholders' Representatives, the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold in the
Escrow Account a number of Escrow Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the
Contested Amount (up to the number of Escrow Shares then available in the Escrow
Account), notwithstanding the occurrence of the Termination Date, until (i)
delivery of a copy of a settlement agreement executed by Parent and either
Company Shareholders' Representative setting forth instructions to the Escrow
Agent as to release of Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account, if any, that shall
be made with respect to the Contested Amount, or (ii) delivery of a copy of the
final award of the majority of the arbitrators setting forth instructions to the
Escrow Agent as to the release of Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account, if any,
that shall be made with respect to the Contested Amount. The Escrow Agent shall
thereupon release Escrow Shares from the Escrow Account (to the extent Escrow
Shares are then held in the Escrow Account) in accordance with such agreement or
instructions.

                      (iii) The non-prevailing party in any such arbitration
proceeding shall pay its own expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the
administration fee of the American Arbitration Association, and the expenses,
including without limitation, the reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, incurred
by the prevailing party to the arbitration.

        3. RELEASE OF ESCROW SHARES.

               (a) Upon the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall provide to
the Escrow Agent a schedule setting forth the allocation of the Escrow Shares
then placed in escrow to the Company Securityholders whom then have an interest
in such shares. In order to facilitate the preparation of stock certificates
representing any Escrow Shares to be distributed to the Company Securityholders
as provided herein, within 10 days after the Termination Date, Parent shall
prepare, and the Company Shareholders' Representatives shall confirm in writing,
an updated schedule setting forth the allocation of the Escrow Shares then held
in escrow (taking into account any increases or decreases in the Escrow Shares
and any Company Securityholders who no longer have an interest in the Escrow
Shares). Parent shall provide such updated allocation schedule to the Escrow
Agent and to its transfer agent. Within 20 days after receipt by the Escrow
Agent of the updated allocation schedule, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock then held in escrow
to Parent's transfer agent. Parent shall promptly cause its transfer agent to
prepare certificates in the amounts and in the names of the Company
Securityholders reflected on the updated allocation schedule. Parent shall
instruct the transfer agent to mail or otherwise deliver such certificates to
the Company Securityholders to the addresses for such Company Securityholders
that are then on file with the transfer agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any Indemnitee shall have asserted a claim for indemnification prior to the
Termination Date and such claim has not yet been resolved, the Escrow Agent
shall retain in the Escrow Account after the Termination Date a number of Escrow
Shares having a Fair Market Value equal to the Claimed Amount or


                                       5.


<PAGE>   78
Contested Amount, as the case may be, which has not then been resolved, upon the
terms set forth in Section 2.

               (b) Notwithstanding Section 3(a), the Escrow Agent shall at the
written direction of the Parent withhold the distribution of that portion of the
Escrow Shares otherwise distributable to the Company Securityholders who have
not, according to written notice provided by Parent to the Escrow Agent prior to
such distribution, surrendered their respective Company Stock Certificates in
accordance with Section 1.8 of the Merger Agreement. Any such withheld amounts
shall be delivered to Parent promptly after the Termination Date, and shall be
delivered by Parent to a Company Securityholder to whom such shares would have
otherwise been distributed upon surrender of their respective Company Stock
Certificates.

               (c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be
distributed to the Company Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement. In lieu
of any fractional shares to which such Company Securityholder would otherwise be
entitled, such Company Securityholders shall be paid in cash an amount equal to
the sum of the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by
multiplying the Fair Market Value by the fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock that would otherwise be deliverable to such Company Securityholders
hereunder. As soon as practicable after the Termination Date, Parent shall
deposit cash with its transfer agent in a sufficient amount to pay all
fractional shares in accordance with this Section 3(c).

        4. VALUATION OF ESCROW SHARES. For purposes of this Agreement, the Fair
Market Value of the Escrow Shares shall be determined based upon the average of
the closing prices of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ National Stock Market
for the fifteen (15) trading-day period ending (and including) one day prior to
the Closing Date (the "Closing Sales Price").

        5. FEES AND EXPENSES.

               (a) Upon execution of this Agreement, an acceptance fee of
$3,500.00 will be payable to the Escrow Agent. This acceptance fee will cover
the initial twelve months of the escrow. If the period which the Escrow Agent is
required to maintain the Escrow Account continues beyond the Termination Date
pursuant to Section 3(a), fees will be payable in accordance with the Escrow
Agent's fee schedules in effect from time to time. The Escrow Agent will also be
entitled to reimbursement for extraordinary expenses incurred in performance of
its duties hereunder.

               (b) Parent shall pay the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent
for the services to be rendered by the Escrow Agent hereunder.

               (c) At the end of the Escrow Period, either of the Company
Shareholders' Representatives shall deliver to Parent and the Escrow Agent an
accounting of all fees, costs and other expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Company Shareholders' Representatives in the performance of
their duties hereunder. All such fees, costs and other expenses incurred by the
Company Shareholders' Representatives in connection with the performance of its
duties hereunder shall be paid by the Company Securityholders; provided however
that, if at the end of the Escrow Period there are Escrow Shares that will be
delivered to


                                       6.


<PAGE>   79
the Company Securityholders pursuant to Section 3(a), the reasonable fees of the
Company Shareholders' Representatives shall be paid by the delivery to such
Company Shareholders' Representatives that number of Escrow Shares equal to the
total amount of such fees divided by the Closing Sales Price. Any such reduction
in shares shall be taken into account in determining the updated allocation
schedule referred to in Section 3(a). Neither Parent nor the Escrow Agent shall
have any liability whatsoever for any fees, costs, or other expenses incurred by
the Company Shareholders' Representatives or for any Escrow Shares delivered to
the Company Shareholders' Representatives in satisfaction of such fees, costs or
other expenses.

        6. DUTIES OF ESCROW AGENT.

               (a) The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order,
judgment, certificate, demand, notice, instrument or other writing delivered to
it hereunder without being required to investigate the validity, accuracy or
content thereof. The Escrow Agent shall not be responsible for the validity or
sufficiency of this Agreement. In all questions arising under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agent may rely on the advice of counsel, and for anything done,
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Escrow Agent based on such advice, the
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to anyone. The Escrow Agent shall not be
required to take any action hereunder involving any expense unless the payment
of such expense is made or provided for in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
it.

               (b) In the event conflicting demands are made or conflicting
notices are served upon the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow Shares, the
Escrow Agent will have the absolute right, at the Escrow Agent's election, to do
either or both of the following: (i) resign as Escrow Agent so a successor can
be appointed pursuant to clause (d) of this Section 6, or (ii) file a suit in
interpleader and obtain an order from a court of competent jurisdiction
requiring the parties to interplead and litigate in such court their several
claims and rights among themselves. In the event such interpleader suit is
brought, the Escrow Agent will thereby be fully released and discharged from all
further obligations imposed upon it under this Agreement, and Parent will pay
the Escrow Agent all costs, expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees expended or
incurred by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the exercise of the Escrow Agent's
rights under this Section 6(b) (such costs, fees and expenses will be treated as
extraordinary fees and expenses for the purposes of Section 5 hereof).

               (c) The Escrow Agent shall be indemnified, jointly and severally,
and saved harmless by the Parent, from and against any and all liability,
including all expenses reasonably incurred in its defense, to which the Escrow
Agent shall be subject by reason of any action taken or omitted or any
investment or disbursement of any part of the Escrow Agent made by the Escrow
Agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, except as a result of the Escrow
Agent's own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The costs and expenses of
enforcing this right of indemnification shall also be paid by the Parent. This
right of indemnification shall survive the termination of this Escrow Agreement,
and the removal or resignation of the Escrow Agent.

               (d) The Escrow Agent shall have no interest in the Escrow Shares,
but is serving as escrow holder only and having only possession thereof.


                                       7.


<PAGE>   80
               (e) The Escrow Agent may resign as Escrow Agent at any time and
for any reason whatsoever. In the event the Escrow Agent desires to resign as
Escrow Agent under this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall deliver a notice to
Parent and the Company Shareholders' Representatives stating the date upon which
such resignation shall be effective; provided however, that any such resignation
shall not be effective until at least the 30th day after Parent and the Company
Shareholders' Representatives receive such notice. Upon the receipt of any such
notice from the Escrow Agent, Parent may appoint a successor escrow agent
without the consent of the Company Shareholders' Representatives so long as such
successor is a bank or trust company with assets of at least $50 million or a
bank or trust company with a parent company with assets of at least $50 million,
and may appoint any other successor escrow agent with the consent of either of
the Company Shareholders' Representatives, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. In the case of the appointment of any successor escrow
agent requiring the consent of either of the Company Shareholders'
Representatives as set forth in the preceding sentence, Parent and either of the
Company Shareholders' Representatives shall deliver a written notice to the
Escrow Agent designating the successor escrow agent. Upon the effectiveness of
the resignation of the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow
Shares to any successor escrow agent properly designated hereunder, whereupon
the Escrow Agent shall be discharged from any and all further obligations
arising hereunder. If upon the effective date of resignation of the Escrow Agent
a successor escrow agent has not been duly designated, the Escrow Agent's sole
responsibility after that time shall be to retain and safeguard the Escrow
Shares until receipt of a designation of successor escrow agent or a final
nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

               (f) In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable to any party for
any special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind, even if the
Escrow Agent has been previously advised of the possibility of such loss or

anyone (except on a need to know basis to individuals who agree to treat such
information confidentially).

               (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Company
Shareholders' Representatives shall constitute a decision of all of the Company
Securityholders for whom shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable to
them are deposited in the Escrow Account and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each such Company Securityholder.

RE:     MERGER PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION
        (THE "REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT"), DATED AS OF JANUARY 25, 2000, BY AND
        AMONG QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, A DELAWARE CORPORATION ("PARENT"), FALCON
        ACQUISITION CORPORATION, A DELAWARE CORPORATION AND A WHOLLY-OWNED
        SUBSIDIARY OF PARENT ("MERGER SUB"), AND SNAPTRACK, INC., A CALIFORNIA
        CORPORATION (THE "COMPANY"), AND THE RELATED CERTIFICATE OF MERGER AND
        THE AGREEMENT OF MERGER BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB (THE
        "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER").

Gentlemen:

This letter is supplied to you in connection with your rendering of opinions
regarding certain federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Unless
otherwise indicated, capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set
forth in the Reorganization Agreement or the Agreement of Merger. The
Reorganization Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the Agreement of Merger,
including exhibits and schedules attached thereto, are collectively referred to
as the "Agreement."

After consulting with its counsel and auditors regarding the meaning of and
factual support for the following representations and assuming that the Merger
is consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, the undersigned
hereby certifies and represents that the following facts are now true and will
continue to be true as of the Effective Time of the Merger and thereafter where
relevant unless the undersigned notifies Cooley Godward LLP and Venture Law
Group in writing otherwise:


        1. Pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company, and the Company will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of
Merger Sub. Specifically, the assets transferred to the Company pursuant to the
Merger will represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of
the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of
the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. In
addition, at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of the net
assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the gross
assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger will continue to be
held by the Company immediately after the Merger. For the purpose of


                                       1.


<PAGE>   88
determining the percentage of the Company's and Merger Sub's net and gross
assets held by the Company immediately following the Merger, the following
assets will be treated as property held by Merger Sub or the Company, as the
case may be, immediately prior but not immediately subsequent to the Merger: (i)
assets disposed of by the Company or Merger Sub (other than assets transferred
from Merger Sub to the Company in the Merger) prior to or subsequent to the
Merger and in contemplation thereof (including without limitation any asset
disposed of by the Company, other than in the ordinary course of business,
pursuant to a plan or intent existing during the period ending at the Effective
Time of the Merger and beginning with the commencement of negotiations (whether
formal or informal) with Parent regarding the Merger (the "Pre-Merger Period"));
(ii) assets used by the Company or Merger Sub to pay shareholders perfecting
dissenters' rights or other expenses or liabilities incurred in connection with
the Merger; and (iii) assets used to make distribution, redemption or other
payments in respect of stock of the Company or rights to acquire such stock
(including payments treated as such for tax purposes) that are made in
contemplation of the Merger or that are related thereto;

        2. Other than (i) in the ordinary course of business, (ii)pursuant to
its obligations under the Agreement, (iii) cash paid to dissenting shareholders,
if any, and (iv) payments of expenses incurred in connection with the Merger,
the Company has made no transfer of any of its assets (including any
distribution of assets with respect to, or in redemption of, stock) in
contemplation of the Merger or during the Pre-Merger Period;

        3. The Company's principal reasons for participating in the Merger are
bona fide business purposes unrelated to taxes;

        4. At the Effective Time of the Merger, the Company will have no
outstanding equity interests other than those disclosed in Section 2.3 of the
Reorganization Agreement or the Disclosure Schedule with respect thereto. At the
Effective Time of the Merger, the Company will have no outstanding warrants,
options, or convertible securities or any other type of right outstanding
pursuant to which any person could acquire shares of Company stock or any other
equity interest in the Company that, if exercised or converted, would affect
Parent's acquisition or retention of Control of the Company, as defined in
Section 368(c) of the Code. As used in this letter, "Control" shall consist of
direct ownership of shares of stock possessing at least eighty percent (80%) of
the total combined voting power of shares of all classes of stock entitled to
vote and at least eighty percent (80%) of the total number of shares of each
other class of stock of the corporation. For purposes of determining Control, a
person shall not be considered to own shares of voting stock if rights to vote
such shares (or to restrict or otherwise control the voting of such shares) are
held by a third party (including a voting trust) other than an agent of such
person;

        5. In the Merger, shares of stock of the Company representing Control of
the Company, as defined in Section 368(c) of the Code, will be exchanged solely
for shares of voting stock of Parent. For purposes of this paragraph, shares of
stock of the Company exchanged in the Merger for cash and other property
(including, without limitation, cash paid to shareholders in lieu of


                                       2.


<PAGE>   89
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) will be treated as shares of stock of
the Company outstanding on the date of the Merger but not exchanged for shares
of voting stock of Parent;

        6. The Company has no plan, obligation, understanding, agreement or
intention to issue additional shares of stock after the Merger, or take any
other action, that would result in Parent losing Control of the Company;

        7. Except for transfers described in both Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the
Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k)(2), the Company has no plan or
intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of its assets or of any of the
assets acquired from Merger Sub in the Merger except for dispositions made in
the ordinary course of business or to pay expenses incurred by the Company
pursuant to the Merger;

        8. The Company intends to continue its historic business or use a
significant portion of its historic business assets in a business following the
Merger;

        9. The liabilities of the Company have been incurred by the Company in
the ordinary course of its business;

        10. The fair market value of the Company's assets will, at the Effective
Time of the Merger, exceed the aggregate liabilities of the Company plus the
amount of liabilities, if any, to which such assets are subject;

        11. The Company is not an "investment company" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code;

        12. The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11
or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A) of the Code;

        13. The Company has made no extraordinary distributions within the
meaning of Temporary Federal Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1T(e) with
respect to its stock, prior to and in connection with the Merger;

        14. The Company has not redeemed and no related person with respect to
the Company, as such term is defined by Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(3) (without regard to Section 1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(a)), has purchased any
Company stock prior to and in connection with the Merger other than purchases of
unvested stock from terminating employees or consultants, which purchases amount
to less than 10% of the Company's outstanding stock as of the Effective Time;

        15. Except with respect to payments of cash to shareholders of the
Company perfecting dissenters' rights, if any, or in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock, or Parent's assumption of liabilities with respect to
Excess Fees, if any, one hundred percent (100%) of the shares of stock of the
Company outstanding immediately prior to the Merger will be exchanged solely for
shares of Parent Common Stock. No stock of Merger Sub will be paid or received


                                       3.


<PAGE>   90
(directly or indirectly, actually or constructively) for stock of the Company.
Thus, except as set forth in the preceding sentence, the Company intends that no
consideration be paid or received (directly or indirectly, actually or
constructively) for shares of stock of the Company other than shares of Parent
Common Stock. The total market value of all consideration other than shares of
Parent Common Stock that will be paid for shares of Company stock exchanged
pursuant to the Agreement will be less than ten percent (10%) of the aggregate
fair market value of shares of stock of the Company outstanding immediately
prior to the Merger;

        16. The fair market value of the shares of Parent Common Stock received
by each shareholder of the Company will be approximately equal to the fair
market value of the shares of stock of the Company surrendered in exchange
therefor and the aggregate consideration received by shareholders of the Company
in exchange for their shares of stock of the Company will be approximately equal
to the fair market value of all of the outstanding shares of stock of the
Company immediately prior to the Merger;

        17. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and each shareholder of
the Company will pay separately his, her or its own expenses relating to the
Merger (other than expenses directly related to the transaction within the
guidelines set forth in Revenue Ruling 73-54, 1973-1 C.B. 187);

        18. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and
the Company or between Merger Sub and the Company that was issued, acquired, or
will be settled at a discount as a result of the Merger; Parent will assume no
liabilities of the Company or any shareholder of the Company in connection with
the Merger;

        19. The terms of the Reorganization Agreement and the other Agreement
relating thereto are the product of arm's length negotiations;

        20. None of the compensation received by any shareholder-employees or
shareholder-independent contractors of the Company will be separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares of stock of the Company;
none of the shares of Parent Common Stock received by any shareholder-employees
or shareholder-independent contractors of the Company will be separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement, consulting
agreement, covenant not to compete or release; and the compensation paid to any
shareholder-employees or shareholder-independent contractors of the Company will
be for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to
third parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services;

        21. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to
Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately
bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in
the transaction to the Company shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent (1%) of the total
consideration that will be issued in the transaction to the Company shareholders
in exchange for their shares of Company


                                       4.

stock. The fractional share interests of each Company shareholder will be
aggregated, and no Company shareholder will receive cash in an amount equal to
or greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock;

        22. With respect to each instance, if any, in which shares of stock of
the Company have been purchased by a stockholder of Parent (a "Stockholder")
during the Pre-Merger period (a "Stock Purchase"): (i) to the best knowledge of
the Company, (A) the Stock Purchase was made by such Stockholder on its own
behalf, rather than as a representative, or for the benefit, of Parent, (B) the
Stock Purchase was entered into solely to satisfy the separate interests of such
Stockholder and the seller, and (C) the purchase price paid by such Stockholder
pursuant to the Stock Purchase was the product of arm's length negotiations; and
(ii) the Stock Purchase was not a formal or informal condition to consummation
of the Merger;

        23. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the material terms
of the Agreement, none of the material terms and conditions therein have been
waived or modified, and the Company has no plan or intention to waive or modify
any such material condition; and

        24. The Company is authorized to make all of the representations set
forth herein.

        The undersigned recognizes that: (i) your opinions will be based on,
among other things, the accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on
the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the
covenants and obligations contained in the Reorganization Agreement and the
various other documents related thereto; (ii) your opinions will be subject to
certain limitations and qualifications including that they may not be relied
upon if any such representations or warranties are not accurate or if any of
such covenants or obligations are not satisfied in all material respects; and
(iii) your opinions will not address any tax consequences of the Merger or any
action taken in connection therewith except as expressly set forth in such
opinions.

        Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the undersigned makes
no representations regarding any actions or conduct of the Company pursuant to
Parent's exercise of control over the Company after the Merger.

RE:     MERGER PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION
        (THE "REORGANIZATION AGREEMENT"), DATED AS OF JANUARY 25, 2000, BY AND
        AMONG QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, A DELAWARE CORPORATION ("PARENT"), FALCON
        ACQUISITION CORPORATION, A DELAWARE CORPORATION AND A WHOLLY-OWNED
        SUBSIDIARY OF PARENT ("MERGER SUB"), AND SNAPTRACK, INC., A CALIFORNIA
        CORPORATION (THE "COMPANY"), AND THE RELATED CERTIFICATE OF MERGER AND
        THE AGREEMENT OF MERGER BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB (THE
        "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER").

Gentlemen:

This letter is supplied to you in connection with your rendering of opinions
regarding certain federal income tax consequences of the Merger. Unless
otherwise indicated, capitalized terms not defined herein have the meanings set
forth in the Reorganization Agreement or the Agreement of Merger. The
Reorganization Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the Agreement of Merger,
including exhibits and schedules attached thereto, are collectively referred to
as the "Agreements."

After consulting with their counsel and auditors regarding the meaning of and
factual support for the following representations and assuming that the Merger
is consummated in accordance with the terms of the Agreements, the undersigned
hereby certify and represent that the following facts are now true and will
continue to be true as of the Effective Time of the Merger and thereafter where
relevant unless the undersigned notifies Cooley Godward LLP and Venture Law
Group in writing otherwise:


        1. Pursuant to the Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company, and the Company will acquire all of the assets and liabilities of
Merger Sub. Specifically, the assets transferred to the Company pursuant to the
Merger will represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of
the net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of
the gross assets held by Merger Sub immediately prior to the Merger. In
addition, Parent has no obligation, understanding, plan or intention to cause
the Company to dispose of assets that would result in the Company failing to
retain assets, immediately following the Merger,


                                       1.


<PAGE>   94
representing at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of the net
assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the gross
assets held by the Company immediately prior to the Merger. For the purpose of
determining the percentage of the Company's and Merger Sub's net and gross
assets held by the Company immediately following the Merger, the following
assets will be treated as property held by Merger Sub or the Company, as the
case may be, immediately prior but not subsequent to the Merger: (i) assets
disposed of by the Company or Merger Sub (other than assets transferred from
Merger Sub to the Company in the Merger) prior to or subsequent to the Merger
and in contemplation thereof (including without limitation any asset disposed of
by the Company, other than in the ordinary course of business, pursuant to a
plan or intent existing during the period ending at the Effective Time of the
Merger and beginning with the commencement of negotiations (whether formal or
informal) with Parent regarding the Merger (the "Pre-Merger Period")); (ii)
assets used by the Company or Merger Sub to pay shareholders perfecting
dissenters' rights or other expenses or liabilities incurred in connection with
the Merger; and (iii) assets used to make distribution, redemption or other
payments in respect of stock of the Company or rights to acquire such stock
(including payments treated as such for tax purposes) that are made in
contemplation of the Merger or that are related thereto;

        2. Parent's principal reasons for participating in the Merger are bona
fide business purposes not related to taxes;

        3. Prior to the Merger, Parent will be in Control of Merger Sub, as
defined in Section 368(c) of the Code. As used in this letter, "Control" shall
consist of direct ownership of shares of stock possessing at least eighty
percent (80%) of the total combined voting power of each class of stock entitled
to vote and at least eighty percent (80%) of the total number of shares of each
other class of stock of the corporation. For purposes of determining Control, a
person shall not be considered to own shares of voting stock if rights to vote
such shares (or to restrict or otherwise control the voting of such shares) are
held by a third party (including a voting trust) other than an agent of such
person;

        4. In the Merger, shares of stock of the Company representing Control of
the Company will be exchanged solely for shares of Parent Common Stock. For
purposes of this paragraph, shares of stock of the Company exchanged in the
Merger for cash and other property (including, without limitation, cash paid to
shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock) will be
treated as shares of stock of the Company outstanding on the date of the Merger
but not exchanged for shares of Parent Common Stock;

        5. Parent has no plan or intention to cause the Company to issue
additional shares of stock after the Merger, or take any other action, that
would result in Parent losing Control of the Company;

        6. Except for transfers described in both Section 368(a)(2)(C) of the
Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(k)(2), Parent has no plan or
intention to: (a) liquidate the Company; (b) merge the Company with or into
another corporation including Parent or its affiliates; (c) sell, distribute or
otherwise dispose of the stock of the Company, or cause the Company to sell or
otherwise dispose of the stock of the Company; or (d) cause the Company to sell
or otherwise dispose of any of its assets or of any assets acquired from Merger
Sub, except


                                       2.


<PAGE>   95
for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or payment of expenses
incurred by the Company pursuant to the Merger;

        7. In the Merger, Merger Sub will have no liabilities assumed by the
Company and will not transfer to the Company any assets subject to liabilities,
except to the extent incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by the Agreements;

        8. Parent intends that, following the Merger, the Company will continue
its historic business or use a significant portion of its historic business
assets in a business;

        9. During the past five (5) years, none of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, including the right to acquire or vote any such
shares have, directly or indirectly, been owned by Parent or, to Parent's
knowledge, affiliates of Parent;

        10. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is an "investment company" within the
meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv) of the Code;

        11. No shareholder of the Company is acting as agent for Parent in
connection with the Merger or the approval thereof; Parent will not reimburse
any shareholder of the Company for any stock of the Company such shareholder may
have purchased or for other obligations such shareholder may have incurred;

        12. Parent has no plan or intention to reacquire any of its stock issued
in the Merger. Except for repurchases or redemptions of Parent Common Stock
that: (i) are consistent with past practices and pursuant to pre-existing,
seasoned and systematic purchase programs that were not created or modified in
connection with the Merger and are not targeted at shares of Parent Common Stock
owned by former Company shareholders; (ii) are made in connection with the
termination of employees in the ordinary course of business; or (iii) are
returns of the Escrow Shares pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, neither the
Company nor Parent nor any "related person" of the Company or Parent (as such
term is defined by Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)(3)) will repurchase
or redeem any of the Parent Common Stock to be issued to the shareholders of the
Company in connection with the Merger;

        13. Except with respect to payments of cash to shareholders of the
Company perfecting dissenters' rights or in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock, or Parent's assumption of liabilities with respect to Excess Fees,
if any, one hundred percent (100%) of the stock of the Company outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger will be exchanged solely for Parent Common
Stock. No stock of Merger Sub will be paid or received (directly or indirectly,
actually or constructively) for stock of the Company. Thus, except as set forth
in the preceding sentence, Merger Sub and Parent intend that no consideration be
paid or received (directly or indirectly, actually or constructively) for stock
of the Company other than Parent Common Stock;

        14. The total fair market value of all consideration other than Parent
Common Stock received by shareholders of the Company in the Merger (including,
without limitation, cash paid to shareholders of the Company perfecting
dissenters' rights or in lieu of fractional shares, or Parent's assumption of
liabilities with respect to Excess Fees, if any) will be less than ten percent


                                       3.


<PAGE>   96
(10%) of the aggregate fair market value of stock of the Company outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger;

        15. The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock received by each
shareholder of the Company will be approximately equal to the fair market value
of the stock of the Company surrendered in exchange therefor, and the aggregate
consideration received by shareholders of the Company in exchange for their
stock of the Company will be approximately equal to the fair market value of all
of the outstanding shares of stock of the Company immediately prior to the
Merger;

        16. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and each shareholder of
the Company will each pay separately his, her or its own expenses relating to
the Merger (other than expenses directly related to the transaction within the
guidelines set forth in Revenue Ruling 73-54, 1973-1 C.B. 187);

        17. There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Parent and
the Company or between Merger Sub and the Company that was issued, acquired or
will be settled at a discount as a result of the Merger, and Parent will assume
no liabilities of the Company or any shareholder of the Company in connection
with the Merger;

        18. The terms of the Reorganization Agreement and the agreements related
thereto are the product of arm's length negotiations;

        19. None of the compensation received by any shareholder-employee of the
Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any of their shares
of stock of the Company; none of the shares of Parent Common Stock received by
any shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of the Company
will be separate consideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement,
consulting agreement, covenant not to compete or release; and the compensation
paid to any shareholder-employee or shareholder-independent contractor of the
Company will be for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with
amounts paid to third parties bargaining at arm's length for similar services;

        20. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to
Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately
bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in
the transaction to the Company shareholders instead of issuing fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent (1%) of the total
consideration that will be issued in the transaction to the Company shareholders
in exchange for their shares of Company stock. The fractional share interests of
each Company shareholder will be aggregated, and no Company shareholder will
receive cash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share
of Parent Common Stock;

        21. With respect to each instance, if any, in which shares of stock of
the Company have been purchased by a stockholder of Parent (a "Stockholder")
during the Pre-Merger Period (a "Stock Purchase") to Parent's knowledge: (i) the
Stock Purchase was made by such Stockholder on its own behalf and not as a
representative, or for the benefit, of Parent; (ii) the purchase price paid by
such Stockholder pursuant to the Stock Purchase was the product of arm's


                                       4.


<PAGE>   97
length negotiations, was funded by such Stockholder's own assets, was not
advanced, and will not be reimbursed, either directly or indirectly, by Parent;
(iii) at no time was such Stockholder or any other party required or obligated
to surrender to Parent the Company stock acquired in the Stock Purchase, and
neither such Stockholder nor any other party will be required to surrender to
Parent the Parent Common Stock for which such shares of stock of the Company
will be exchanged in the Merger; and (iv) the Stock Purchase was not a formal or
informal condition to consummation of the Merger and was entered into solely to
satisfy the separate interests of such Stockholder and the seller;

        22. Following the Merger, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will comply
with the record-keeping and information filing requirements of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-3;

        23. The Merger will be consummated in compliance with the material terms
of the Agreements, none of the material terms and conditions therein have been
waived or modified, and Parent has no plan or intention to waive or modify any
such material condition;

        24. Merger Sub was formed solely for the purposes of effecting the
Merger and has conducted no business or other activities except in connection
with the Merger;

        25. Any Parent Common Stock received by the shareholders of the Company
placed in escrow will appear as issued and outstanding on the balance sheet of
Parent and will be legally outstanding under applicable law; and

        26. Parent and Merger Sub are authorized to make all of the
representations set forth herein.

        The undersigned recognize that: (i) your opinions will be based on,
among other things, the accuracy of the representations set forth herein and on
the accuracy of the representations and warranties and the satisfaction of the

action taken in connection therewith except as expressly set forth in such
opinions.

                        FORM OF NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT


<PAGE>   101
                            NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT

        THIS NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") is being entered into
effective as of January 25, 2000 by and between ____________ ("Employee") and
QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain
capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 20 and those
capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined herein).

                                    RECITALS

        A. As a substantial stockholder and employee of SNAPTRACK, INC.
("SnapTrack"), Employee obtained extensive and valuable knowledge and
confidential information concerning the businesses of SnapTrack.

        B. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated
as of January 25, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement") among the Company, Falcon
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company, and SnapTrack, the Company will acquire SnapTrack by way of a
reverse triangular merger. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
Agreement will only become effective as of the Closing Date. As a result of the
Company's acquisition of SnapTrack, SnapTrack will become a subsidiary of the
Company.

        C. In connection with the acquisition of SnapTrack by the Company
pursuant to the Merger Agreement, and to enable the Company to secure more fully
the benefits of such acquisition, the Company has required as a condition to the
consummation of such acquisition, that Employee enter into this Agreement; and
Employee is entering into this Agreement in order to induce the Company to
consummate the acquisition contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Employee agrees
to comply with the restrictions set forth in this Agreement in exchange for the
Company's purchase of all of Employee's shares in SnapTrack.

        D. The Company and SnapTrack have conducted and are conducting their
respective businesses on a national and international basis.

        E. Employee and Company are entering into an employment relationship
whereby Employee will become an employee of the Company. In the event Employee's
employment with the Company is terminated without Cause, the Noncompetition
Period will cease.

                                    AGREEMENT

In order to induce the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, Employee
agrees as follows:

        1. RESTRICTION ON COMPETITION. Employee agrees that, during the
Noncompetition Period, Employee shall not:

               (a) engage directly or indirectly in Competition in any
Restricted Territory; or


<PAGE>   102
               (b) directly or indirectly be or become an officer, director,
stockholder, owner, co-owner, Affiliate, partner, promoter, employee, agent,
representative, designer, consultant, advisor, manager of, for or to, or
otherwise be or become associated with or acquire or hold (of record,
beneficially or otherwise) any direct or indirect interest in, any Person (or
any division, group or other subset or operating unit of any Person) that
generates or derives, from time to time in a twelve-month period, more than 15%
of its total sales or gross profits from in direct or indirect engagement in
Competition in any Restricted Territory;

provided, however, that Employee may, without violating this Section 1, own, as
a passive investment, shares of capital stock of a publicly-held corporation if
(i) such shares are actively traded on an established national securities market
in the United States, (ii) the number of shares of such corporation's capital
stock that are owned beneficially (directly or indirectly) by Employee plus the
number of shares of such corporation's capital stock that are owned beneficially
(directly or indirectly) by Employee's Affiliates represent collectively less
than 5% of the total number of shares of such corporation's capital stock
outstanding, and (iii) neither Employee nor any Affiliate of Employee is
otherwise associated directly or indirectly with such corporation or with any
Affiliate of such corporation.

        2. NO HIRING OR SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES. Employee agrees that, as of
the date of this Agreement and continuing through the Noncompetition Period,
regardless of whether Employee remains employed throughout the Noncompetition
Period, Employee shall not, and shall not permit any of Employee's controlled
Affiliates to: (a) hire any Specified Employee, or (b) directly or indirectly,
personally or through others, encourage, induce, attempt to induce, solicit or
attempt to solicit (on Employee's own behalf or on behalf of any other Person)
any Specified Employee or any other employee to leave his or her employment with
the Company, SnapTrack, or any of their respective Affiliates. For purposes of
this Section 3, "Specified Employee" shall mean any individual who: (i) is or
was an employee of SnapTrack or any of its respective Affiliates, at any time
during the 180-day period ending on the date of this Agreement, unless such
individual's employment with SnapTrack or any of its Affiliates was terminated
without Cause or is subject to Constructive Termination (other than pursuant to
clause (iii) of the definition of Constructive Termination) by the Company or
any of its Affiliates and such individual is hired by Employee to engage in
activities that do not qualify such individual as engaging in Competition or
(ii) (A) remains or becomes an employee of the Company, SnapTrack or any of
their respective Affiliates or successors at any time commencing as of the date
this Agreement is signed by Employee and continuing through the Noncompetition
Period, unless such individual's employment with the Company, SnapTrack or any
of their respective Affiliates was terminated without Cause or is subject to
Constructive Termination (other than pursuant to clause (iii) of the definition
of Constructive Termination) by the Company, SnapTrack or any of their
respective Affiliates and such individual is hired by Employee to engage in
activities that do not qualify such individual as engaging in Competition, and
(B) engages in activities within the meaning of the word Competition on behalf
of the Company, SnapTrack, of any of their respective Affiliates or successors.

        3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Employee represents and warrants, to
and for the benefit of the Indemnitees, that, as of the date Employee signs this
Agreement,: (a) Employee has full power and capacity to execute and deliver, and
to perform all of Employee's obligations under, this Agreement; and (b) neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the


                                       2.


<PAGE>   103
performance of this Agreement will result directly or indirectly in a violation
or breach of (i) any agreement or obligation by which Employee or any of
Employee's Affiliates is or may be bound, or (ii) to Employee's knowledge, any
law, rule or regulation. Employee's representations and warranties shall survive
the expiration of the Noncompetition Period for an unlimited period of time.

        4. INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Employee agrees that Employee is obligated under
this Agreement to render services and comply with covenants of a special,
unique, unusual and extraordinary character, thereby giving this Agreement
peculiar value so that the loss of such service or violation by Employee of this
Agreement, including but not limited to, Sections 1 and 2 could not reasonably
or adequately be compensated in damages at law. Therefore, notwithstanding
Section 13, Employee agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened
breach by Employee of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement,
each of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the other Indemnitees shall
be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it,
including monetary damages) to seek and obtain (a) a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or
obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.
Employee further agrees that no Indemnitee shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 4, and Employee irrevocably
waives any right Employee may have to require any Indemnitee to obtain, furnish
or post any such bond or similarly instrument.

        5. INDEMNIFICATION. Without in any way limiting any of the rights or
remedies otherwise available to any of the Indemnitees, Employee shall indemnify
and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and from any loss, damage, injury,
liability, claim, demand, settlement, judgment, award, fine, penalty, tax, fee
(including attorneys' fees), charge, cost (including any cost of investigation)
or expense of any nature (whether or not relating to any third-party claim) that
is directly or indirectly suffered or incurred at any time (whether during or
after the Noncompetition Period) by such Indemnitee, or to which such Indemnitee
otherwise becomes subject at any time (whether during or after the
Noncompetition Period), and that arises directly or indirectly out of or by
virtue of, or relates directly or indirectly to, (a) any inaccuracy in or breach
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, or (b) any
failure on the part of Employee to observe, perform or abide by, or any other
breach of, any restriction, covenant, obligation or other provision contained in
this Agreement.

        6. NON-EXCLUSIVITY. The rights and remedies of the Company, the
Surviving Corporation and the other Indemnitees under this Agreement are not
exclusive of or limited by any other rights or remedies which any of them may
have, whether at law, in equity, by contract or otherwise, all of which shall be
cumulative (and not alternative). Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the rights and remedies of the Company, the Surviving Corporation and
the other Indemnitees under this Agreement, and the obligations and liabilities
of Employee under this Agreement, are in addition to their respective rights,
remedies, obligations and liabilities under the law of unfair competition, under
laws relating to misappropriation of trade secrets, under other laws and common
law requirements and under all applicable rules and regulations. Nothing in this
Agreement shall limit any of Employee's obligations, or the rights or remedies
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of the other Indemnitees, under
the Merger Agreement; and nothing in the Merger Agreement shall limit any of
Employee's


                                       3.


<PAGE>   104
obligations, or any of the rights or remedies of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of the other Indemnitees, under this Agreement. No breach on
the part of the Company, SnapTrack or Merger Sub of any covenant or obligation
contained in the Merger Agreement, or any other agreement shall limit or
otherwise affect any right or remedy of the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or any of the other Indemnitees under this Agreement.

        7. SEVERABILITY. Each provision of this Agreement is separable from
every other provision of this Agreement, and each part of each provision of this
Agreement is separable from every other part of such provision. If any provision
of this Agreement or any part of any such provision is held under any
circumstances to be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, then (a) such
provision or part thereof shall, with respect to such circumstances and in such
jurisdiction, be deemed amended to conform to applicable laws so as to be valid
and enforceable to the fullest possible extent, (b) the invalidity or
unenforceability of such provision or part thereof under such circumstances and
in such jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such
provision or part thereof under any other circumstances or in any other
jurisdiction, and (c) the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision or
part thereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of
such provision or the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this
Agreement.

        8. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with,
and governed in all respects by, the laws of the State of California (without
giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws)

        9. WAIVER. No failure on the part of the Company, Surviving Corporation,
or any other Indemnitee to exercise any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, and no delay on the part of the Company. Surviving Corporation,
or any other Indemnitee in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy
under this Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege
or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy. No Indemnitee shall be deemed to have waived
any claim of such Indemnitee arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy of such Indemnitee under this Agreement, unless the waiver
of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a
written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such Indemnitee; and
any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the
specific instance in which it is given.

        10. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of Employee and Employee's heirs, executors, estate,
personal representatives and legal representatives. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the other Indemnitees. Each of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and the other Indemnitees may freely assign any or all of its rights
under this Agreement, at any time, in whole or in part, to any Person in
connection with the sale of all or a substantial portion of the business
conducted or proposed to be conducted by SnapTrack prior to the date of this
Agreement to such other Person without obtaining the consent or approval of
Employee or of any other Person. Because of the unique and personal nature of
Employee's duties under this Agreement, neither this Agreement nor any rights or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assignable by Employee.

        11. INTEGRATION. This Agreement forms the complete and exclusive
statement of Employee's agreement with the Company regarding the subject matter
hereof. The terms in this Agreement supersede any other agreements or promises
made to Employee by anyone regarding the subject matter herein.

        12. FURTHER ASSURANCES. Employee shall (at Employee's sole expense)
execute and/or cause to be delivered to each Indemnitee such instruments and
other documents, and shall (at Employee's sole expense) take such other actions,
as any Indemnitee may reasonably request at any time (whether during or after
the Noncompetition Period) for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

        13. ARBITRATION. To ensure rapid and economical resolution of any
disputes which may arise under this Agreement, Employee and the Company agree
that any and all disputes or controversies of any nature whatsoever, arising
from or regarding the interpretation, performance, enforcement or breach of this
Agreement shall be resolved by confidential, final and binding arbitration
(rather than trial by jury or court or resolution in some other forum) to the
fullest extent permitted by law. Any arbitration proceeding pursuant to this
Agreement shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in
San Diego under the then existing employment-related AAA arbitration rules. If
for any reason all or part of this arbitration provision is held to be invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect
any other portion of this arbitration provision or any other jurisdiction, but
this provision will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as
if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable part or parts of this provision had
never been contained herein, consistent with the general intent of the parties
insofar as possible.

EMPLOYEE HAS READ Section 13 AND IRREVOCABLY AGREES TO ARBITRATE ANY DISPUTE

expiration of the Noncompetition Period shall not operate to relieve Employee of
any obligation or liability arising from any prior breach by Employee of any
provision of this Agreement.

are absolute and shall not be terminated or otherwise limited by virtue of any

Employee's responsibilities which Employee now has with the Company.

<PAGE>   110
                                 GENERAL RELEASE

        THIS GENERAL RELEASE ("General Release") is being executed and delivered
as of _________, 2000, by _____________ ("Releasor") to and in favor of, and for
the benefit of, SNAPTRACK, INC., a California corporation ("SnapTrack"),
QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation ("QUALCOMM"), and the other
Releasees (as defined in Section 2).


                                    RECITALS

               A. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
dated as of January 25, 2000 the ("Merger Agreement") among QUALCOMM, Falcon
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
QUALCOMM, and SnapTrack, QUALCOMM will acquire SnapTrack by way of a reverse
triangular merger.

               B. In connection with the acquisition by QUALCOMM of SnapTrack
pursuant to the Merger Agreement (and as a condition to the consummation of such
acquisition), and to enable QUALCOMM to secure more fully the benefits of such
acquisition, QUALCOMM has required that Releasor enter into this General
Release; and Releasor is entering into this General Release in order to induce
QUALCOMM to consummate the acquisition contemplated by the Merger Agreement and
to purchase Releasor's shares of the capital stock of SnapTrack.


                                    AGREEMENT

        In order to induce QUALCOMM to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement, and for other valuable consideration (the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by Releasor), Releasor hereby
covenants and agrees as follows:

        1. RELEASE. Releasor, for himself and for each of Releasor's Associated
Parties (as defined in Section 2), hereby generally, irrevocably,
unconditionally and completely releases and forever discharges each of the
Releasees (as defined in Section 2) from, and hereby irrevocably,
unconditionally and completely waives and relinquishes, each of the Released
Claims (as defined in Section 2).

        2. DEFINITIONS.

               (a) The term "Associated Parties," when used herein with respect
to Releasor, shall mean and include: (i) Releasor's predecessors, successors,
executors, administrators, heirs and estate; (ii) Releasor's past, present and
future assigns, agents and representatives; (iii) each entity that Releasor has

directly or indirectly exercises control; and (iv) each entity of which Releasor
owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50% of the outstanding equity,
beneficial, proprietary, ownership or voting interests.


<PAGE>   111
               (b) The term "Releasees" shall mean and include: (i) QUALCOMM;

relates directly or indirectly to, any circumstance, agreement, activity,
action, omission, event or matter occurring or existing on or prior to the date

under, any statute or common law principle of similar effect in any
jurisdiction.

        4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Releasor represents and warrants

Releasor's Associated Parties that challenges or would challenge the execution
and delivery of this General Release or the taking of any of the actions
required to be taken by Releasor under this General Release;

               (h) neither the execution and delivery of this General Release
nor the performance hereof will (i) result in any violation or breach of any
agreement or other instrument to which Releasor or any of Releasor's Associated
Parties is a party or by which Releasor or, to Releasor's knowledge, any of
Releasor's Associated Parties is bound, or (ii) result in a violation or any

           FORM OF LEGAL OPINION OF ORRICK HERRINGTON & SUTCLIFFE LLP


<PAGE>   116
                    FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO SNAPTRACK


        As used herein, "Company" refers to SnapTrack, Inc., a California
corporation. All other capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
respective meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement.

        1. The Company has been duly incorporated and is a validly existing
corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of California.

        2. The Company has the requisite corporate power to own or lease its
property and assets and to conduct its business as it is currently being
conducted. To our knowledge, the Company is qualified as a foreign corporation
to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in the United States
in which the ownership of its property or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified would not
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse affect on the Company, its
assets, financial condition or operations.

        3. The Company's authorized capital stock consists of: (i) 28,000,000
shares of Common Stock ($.0005 par value per share), of which 4,774,580 shares
have been issued and are outstanding as of the date hereof; and (ii) 14,000,000
shares of Preferred Stock ($.0005 par value per share), (A) 600,000 of which
have been designated "Series A Preferred Stock," all of which have been issued
and are outstanding as of the date hereof, (B) 1,280,000 of which have been
designated "Series B Preferred Stock," all of which have been issued and are
outstanding as of the date hereof, (C) 2,636,362 of which have been designated
"Series C Preferred Stock," 2,454,544 of which have been issued and are
outstanding as of the date hereof, (D) 3,200,000 of which have been designated
"Series D Preferred Stock," 3,133,164 of which have been issued and are
outstanding as of the date hereof, and (E) 6,000,000 of which have been
designated "Series E Preferred Stock," none of which have been issued or are
outstanding as of the date hereof. The outstanding shares of Common Stock and of
Preferred Stock have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable. To the best of our knowledge, there are no options, warrants,
conversion privileges, preemptive rights or other rights presently outstanding
to purchase any of the authorized but unissued capital stock of the Company,
other than the conversion privileges of the Company Preferred Stock, 5,178,000
shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Company Stock
Option Plans, of which options to purchase 3,308,108 shares are outstanding as
of the date hereof, warrants to purchase ________ shares of Common Stock,
warrants to purchase ________ shares of Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to
purchase __________ shares of Series D Preferred Stock.

        4. The Merger Agreement and the California Agreement of Merger have been
duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties thereto,
constitute valid and binding agreements of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with their terms, except as rights to indemnity under
Sections 9 and 10 of the Merger Agreement may be limited by applicable laws and
except as enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights, and subject to general


                                       1.


<PAGE>   117
equity principles and to limitations on availability of equitable relief,
including specific performance.

        5. The execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and the California
Agreement of Merger by the Company and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated thereby do not violate any provision of the Company's Amended and
Restated Articles of Incorporation or bylaws, as amended, and do not constitute
a material default under the provisions of any Material Contract referenced in
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and, to our knowledge, do not violate or
contravene (a) any governmental statute, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company or (b) any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, determination or
award which has been entered against the Company and of which we are aware, the
violation or contravention of which would materially and adversely affect the
Company, its assets, financial condition or operations.

        6. To the best of our knowledge, there is no action, proceeding or
investigation pending or overtly threatened against the Company before any court
or administrative agency that questions the validity of the Merger Agreement,
the California Agreement of Merger or which reasonably could be expected to
result, either individually or in the aggregate, in any material adverse change
in the assets, financial condition, or operations of the Company that has not
been disclosed in writing to QUALCOMM Incorporated.

        7. All consents, approvals, authorizations or orders of, or filings,
registrations and qualifications with any regulatory authority or governmental
body in the United States required for the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement have been made or obtained,
except (a) the filing of the California Agreement of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of California as contemplated by Section 1.3 of the Merger
Agreement, (b) the filing of the Delaware Certificate of Merger with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as contemplated by Section 1.3 of
the Merger Agreement, (c) any filings which may be required to be made in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby under
applicable state or federal securities laws; and (d) any filings, registrations
and qualifications which if not made, would not be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the assets, financial condition or operations of the Company.

        8. The Merger Agreement and the California Agreement of Merger have been
duly authorized and executed by the Company and upon the filing of the
California Agreement of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
California and the Delaware Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware, the Merger will be effective.

        6. To the best of our knowledge, there is no action, proceeding or

                               LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

        This LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of January
25, 2000 by and among QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation ("Parent")
and STEPHEN POIZNER ("Securityholder"). Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

                                    RECITALS

        A. Securityholder is the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Preferred Stock and/or Company Options set forth on the signature page
hereof (collectively, the "Company Securities").

        B. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated
as of January 25, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement"), Parent, Falcon Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub") and SnapTrack, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company")
Parent will acquire the Company by way of a reverse triangular merger whereby
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") and the Company
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

        C. In connection with and as a result of the Merger, Securityholder will
receive shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for or upon exercise of the
Company Securities.

        D. In connection with the Merger, Securityholder will become a key
employee of Parent and will be instrumental in assisting Parent in the
transition of the business of the Company to Parent.

        E. In connection with the Merger, Securityholder is entering into a
noncompetition agreement with Parent (the "Noncompetition Agreement") whereby
Securityholder has agreed, among other things, to refrain from engaging in
certain competitive activities, as defined therein.

        F. In order to enable Parent to secure the benefits of the Merger and to
induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required as a
condition to the consummation of the Merger that Securityholder enter into this
Agreement; and Securityholder hereby is entering into this Agreement to induce
Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.      DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement:

        (a) "CAUSE" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following: (i) gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of Securityholder's duties
to Parent where such gross negligence or willful misconduct has resulted or is
likely to result in substantial and material damage to Parent or its
subsidiaries, (ii) repeated unexplained or unjustified absence from Parent,
(iii) a material and willful violation of any federal or state law, rule or
regulation, (iv) commission of any act of fraud with respect to Parent, (v)
conviction of a felony or a crime


                                       1.

involving moral turpitude causing material hard to the standing and reputation
of Parent, in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
Parent, or (vi) breach of any material element of the Company's Confidential
Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, Parent's Proprietary Information
and Inventions Agreement, or the Noncompetition Agreement entered into between
Securityholder and Parent.

        (b) "CONSTRUCTIVE TERMINATION" shall mean Securityholder's voluntary
termination upon 30 days prior written notice to Parent, following (i) any
reduction of Securityholder's base compensation provided by Parent (other than
in connection with a general decrease in base salaries for most officers of
Parent), (ii) Securityholder's refusal to relocate to a facility or location
more than 30 miles from the Company's current location, or (iii) a material
reduction of Securityholder's responsibilities with Parent after the Closing;
provided that Securityholder understands and agrees that in connection with the
Merger, Securityholder will assume a new title and responsibilities that may be
different than the title or responsibilities which Securityholder now has with
the Company and such new title and responsibilities with Parent will not be
deemed to be a Constructive Termination unless the new responsibilities reflect
a material reduction of Securityholder's responsibilities which Securityholder
now has with the Company.

        (c) "DISABILITY" shall mean total and permanent disability as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

        (d) "LOCK-UP SHARES" shall mean one hundred percent (100%) of any and
all shares of Parent Common Stock which Securityholder receives or has the right
to receive in the Merger (including all shares of Parent Common Stock received
in exchange for shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held
by Securityholder and all shares of Parent Common Stock which Securityholder has
the right to receive upon the exercise of any Company Options held by
Securityholder (including any shares of Parent Common Stock issued into or held
in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement)); provided that for purposes of determining the Lock-Up Shares which
Securityholder is entitled to Transfer in any Quarter (as defined below), only
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options held by
Securityholder which have vested as of such Quarter shall be included.

        (e) A Securityholder shall be deemed to have effected a "TRANSFER" of
Lock-Up Shares if such Securityholder directly or indirectly: (i) sells,
pledges, encumbers, grants an option with respect to, transfers or disposes of
such security or any interest in such security; or (ii) enters into an agreement
or commitment contemplating the possible sale, pledge, encumbrance, transfer or
disposition of, of grant of an option with respect to, such Lock-Up Shares or
interest therein.

2.      RESTRICTIONS ON RESALE OF LOCK-UP SHARES.

        (a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, Securityholder shall
not be entitled to Transfer any of the Lock-Up Shares except as follows:


                                       2.


<PAGE>   3
               (i) During each of the initial five three-month periods (each
such three-month period being referred to as a "Quarter") immediately following
the Closing, Securityholder shall be entitled to Transfer not more than ten
percent (10%) of the total number of Lock-Up Shares; provided that the total
number of Lock-Up Shares which Securityholder is entitled to Transfer in any
Quarter but which Securityholder does not Transfer in such Quarter shall be
added to the number of Lock-Up Shares which Securityholder is entitled to
Transfer in the next succeeding Quarter; and

               (ii) The restrictions on the Transfer of Lock-Up Shares set forth
in Section 2(a)(i) above shall terminate, and Securityholder shall be entitled
to Transfer all Lock-Up Shares, on the date that is the earlier of (1) the first
day of the sixth Quarter subsequent to the Closing (the "Release Date"), and (2)
the death or Disability of Securityholder; provided, however that, if, prior to
the last day of the fifth Quarter following the Closing, Securityholder's
employment with Parent terminates for any reason (other than death or
Disability) or for no reason, other than a termination by Parent without Cause
or a Constructive Termination, then in such event, the Release Date shall
instead be the date that is one year following the date of such termination.

3.      LEGEND; STOP TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS.

        (a) LEGENDS. In addition to any legends that may be appropriate under
federal and state securities laws, each certificate representing Lock-Up Shares
(whether such certificate is issued in connection with the Closing or upon the
exercise of Company Options) shall bear a legend in the following form:

        "THE SECURITY OR SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE
        SOLD, EXCHANGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED OR DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN
        COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE LOCK-UP AGREEMENT DATED
        AS OF JANUARY 25, 2000 BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF
        THIS CERTIFICATE, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
        OFFICES OF THE ISSUER."

        (b) STOP-TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. Parent shall issue stop transfer
instructions to Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Lock-Up Shares
instructing such transfer agent to prohibit such shares from being transferred
without prior written instructions from Parent.

entity (with or without notice or lapse of time) any right of termination,
amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result (with or without notice or
lapse of time) in the creation of any encumbrance or restriction on any of the
Lock-Up Shares pursuant to, any contract to which Securityholder is a party or
by which Securityholder or any of his affiliates or properties is or may be
bound or affected. The execution and delivery of this agreement by

will not, require any consent or approval of any person or entity.

Parent and Parent's affiliates from and against, and shall compensate and

liability, fee (including attorneys' fees), demand, cost or expense (regardless
of whether or not such loss, damage, claim, liability, fee, demand, cost or
expense relates to a third-party claim) that is directly or indirectly suffered
or incurred by Parent or any of Parent's affiliates, or to which Parent or any
of Parent's affiliates otherwise becomes subject, and that arises directly or
indirectly from (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, or (b) any failure on the part of

                               LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

        This LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is entered into as of January
25, 2000 by and among QUALCOMM INCORPORATED, a Delaware corporation ("Parent")
and NORMAN KRASNER ("Securityholder"). Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

                                    RECITALS

        A. Securityholder is the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock,
Company Preferred Stock and/or Company Options set forth on the signature page
hereof (collectively, the "Company Securities").

        B. Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated
as of January 25, 2000 (the "Merger Agreement"), Parent, Falcon Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub") and SnapTrack, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"),
Parent will acquire the Company by way of a reverse triangular merger whereby
Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the "Merger") and the Company
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

        C. In connection with and as a result of the Merger, Securityholder will
receive shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for or upon exercise of the
Company Securities.

        D. In connection with the Merger, Securityholder will become a key
employee of Parent and will be instrumental in assisting Parent in the
transition of the business of the Company to Parent.

        E. In connection with the Merger, Securityholder is entering into a
noncompetition agreement with Parent (the "Noncompetition Agreement") whereby
Securityholder has agreed, among other things, to refrain from engaging in
certain competitive activities, as defined therein.

        F. Concurrent with the Closing, Parent, Securityholder and the Escrow
Agent (as defined herein), shall enter into an Escrow Agreement which shall set
forth certain agreements among the parties with respect to the matters
contemplated hereby (the "Escrow Agreement").

        G. In order to enable Parent to secure the benefits of the Merger and to
induce Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent has required as a
condition to the consummation of the Merger that Securityholder enter into this
Agreement; and Securityholder hereby is entering into this Agreement to induce
Parent to enter into the Merger Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

1.      DEFINITIONS. As used in this Agreement:

        (a) "CAUSE" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following: (i) gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of Securityholder's duties
to Parent where such gross


                                       1.


<PAGE>   2
negligence or willful misconduct has resulted or is likely to result in
substantial and material damage to Parent or its subsidiaries, (ii) repeated
unexplained or unjustified absence from Parent, (iii) a material and willful
violation of any federal or state law, rule or regulation, (iv) commission of
any act of fraud with respect to Parent, (v) conviction of a felony or a crime
involving moral turpitude causing material hard to the standing and reputation
of Parent, in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of
Parent, or (vi) breach of any material element of the Company's Confidential
Information and Invention Assignment Agreement, Parent's Proprietary Information
and Inventions Agreement or the Noncompetition Agreement entered into between
Securityholder and Parent.

        (b) "CONSTRUCTIVE TERMINATION" shall mean Securityholder's voluntary
termination upon 30 days prior written notice to Parent, following (i) any
reduction of Securityholder's base compensation provided by Parent (other than
in connection with a general decrease in base salaries for most officers of
Parent), (ii) Securityholder's refusal to relocate to a facility or location
more than 30 miles from the Company's current location, or (iii) a material
reduction of Securityholder's responsibilities with Parent after the Closing;
provided that Securityholder understands and agrees that in connection with the
Merger, Securityholder will assume a new title and responsibilities that may be
different than the title or responsibilities which Securityholder now has with
the Company and such new title and responsibilities with Parent will not be
deemed to be a Constructive Termination unless the new responsibilities reflect
a material reduction of Securityholder's responsibilities which Securityholder
now has with the Company.

        (c) "DISABILITY" shall mean total and permanent disability as defined in
Section 22(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

        (d) "SECURITYHOLDER SHARES" shall mean any and all shares of Parent
Common Stock which Securityholder receives or has the right to receive in the
Merger (including all shares of Parent Common Stock received in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held by
Securityholder and all shares of Parent Common Stock which Securityholder has
the right to receive upon the exercise of any Company Options held by
Securityholder (including any shares of Parent Common Stock issued into or held
in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement)), other than Company Options to acquire up to 5,000 shares of Company
Common Stock.

        (e) A Securityholder shall be deemed to have effected a "TRANSFER" of
Lock-Up Shares if such Securityholder directly or indirectly: (i) sells,
pledges, encumbers, grants an option with respect to, transfers or disposes of
such security or any interest in such security; or (ii) enters into an agreement
or commitment contemplating the possible sale, pledge, encumbrance, transfer or
disposition of, of grant of an option with respect to, such Lock-Up Shares or
interest therein.

        (f) "TRANSFERABLE SHARES" shall mean 50% of the Securityholder Shares;
provided that for purposes of determining the Securityholder Shares which
Securityholder is entitled to Transfer in any Quarter (as defined below), only
that number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Options held by
Securityholder which have vested as of such Quarter shall be included.


                                       2.


<PAGE>   3
2.      ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW; SALES OF SECURITYHOLDER SHARES.

        (a) (i) Upon the Closing of the Merger, Parent shall deliver to Harris
Trust Company of California or such other national bank or trust company as the
parties shall mutually agree (the "Escrow Agent"), all of the Securityholder
Shares (other than the Securityholder Shares that will be placed in Escrow
pursuant to Section 1.10 of the Merger Agreement) to be held in escrow for the
account of the Securityholder, and (ii) upon the termination of the Escrow
Period, the Securityholder Shares that were placed in escrow at the Closing of
the Merger shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent to be held in escrow for the
account of the Securityholder (the Securityholder Shares to be delivered to the
Escrow Agent pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall be collectively
referred to herein as the "Escrow Amount").

        (b) At any time following the Closing, Securityholder shall have the
right to direct the Escrow Agent to Transfer all or any portion of the
Transferable Shares held by the Escrow Agent. As part of the foregoing
authorization to Transfer, Securityholder shall be permitted to designate which
of the Transferable Shares shall be Transferred by the Escrow Agent on behalf of
the Securityholder. All proceeds from any such Transfers of Transferable Shares
(and all interest, dividends or other property received with respect thereto)
(the "Proceeds") shall be added to the Escrow Amount, shall be held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and shall be included in all calculations of the Escrow Amount for
the purposes of Section 3 hereof. Securityholder shall have the right to control
and direct the investment of the Proceeds in any manner Securityholder deems
appropriate.

        (c) Securityholder shall not be entitled to Transfer any Securityholder
Shares except as expressly permitted by Section 3.

3.      WITHDRAWAL OF PROCEEDS; RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER OF LOCK-UP SHARES.

        (a) Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, Securityholder shall
not be entitled to withdraw any of the Securityholder Shares or Proceeds from
the Escrow Amount except as follows: during each of the initial three
three-month periods (each such three-month period being referred to as a
"Quarter") immediately following the Closing, Securityholder shall be entitled
to withdraw not more than either twenty percent (20%) of the Transferable Shares
or Proceeds received from the Transfer of twenty percent (20%) of the
Transferable Shares and during the fourth Quarter following the Closing,
Securityholder shall be entitled to withdraw the remaining Transferable Shares
or Proceeds received from the Transfer of the remaining Transferable Shares;
provided that the aggregate amount of Transferable Shares and Proceeds received
from the Transfer of Transferable Shares which Securityholder is entitled to
withdraw in any Quarter but which Securityholder does not withdraw in such
Quarter shall be added to the Transferable Shares and Proceeds which
Securityholder is entitled to withdraw in the next succeeding Quarter.

        (b) Except as set forth above, the restrictions on the Transfer of all
Escrow Amounts shall terminate, and Securityholder shall be entitled to Transfer
all Escrow Amounts held by the Escrow Agent, on the date that is the earlier of
(1) the first day of the sixth Quarter subsequent to the Closing (the "Release
Date"), and (2) the death or Disability of Securityholder; provided


                                       3.


<PAGE>   4
however that, if, prior to last day of the fifth Quarter following the Closing,
Securityholder's employment with Parent terminates for any reason (other than
death or Disability) or for no reason, other than a termination by Parent
without Cause or by Securityholder by reason of a Constructive Termination, then
in such event, the Release Date shall instead be the date that is one year
following the date of such termination.

4.      LEGEND; STOP TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS.

        (a) LEGENDS. In addition to any legends that may be appropriate under
federal and state securities laws, each certificate representing Lock-Up Shares
(whether such certificate is issued in connection with the Closing or upon the
exercise of Company Options) shall bear a legend in the following form:

        "THE SECURITY OR SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY NOT BE
        SOLD, EXCHANGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED OR DISPOSED OF EXCEPT IN
        COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THE LOCK-UP AGREEMENT DATED
        AS OF JANUARY 25, 2000 BETWEEN THE ISSUER AND THE REGISTERED HOLDER OF
        THIS CERTIFICATE, A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE
        OFFICES OF THE ISSUER."

        (b) STOP-TRANSFER INSTRUCTIONS. Parent shall issue stop transfer
instructions to Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Lock-Up Shares
instructing such transfer agent to prohibit such shares from being transferred
without prior written instructions from Parent.

5.      REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SECURITYHOLDER.

the Securityholder. All proceeds from any such Transfers of Transferable Shares
(and all interest, dividends or other property received with respect thereto)
(the "Proceeds") shall be added to the Escrow Amount, shall be held by the
Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement, and shall be included in all calculations of the Escrow Amount for

not be entitled to withdraw any of the Securityholder Shares or Proceeds from
the Escrow Amount except as follows: during each of the initial three
three-month periods (each such three-month period being referred to as a
"Quarter") immediately following the Closing, Securityholder shall be entitled
to withdraw not more than either twenty percent (20%) of the Transferable Shares
or Proceeds received from the Transfer of twenty percent (20%) of the
Transferable Shares and during the fourth Quarter following the Closing,
Securityholder shall be entitled to withdraw the remaining Transferable Shares
or Proceeds received from the Transfer of the remaining Transferable Shares;
provided that the aggregate amount of Transferable Shares and Proceeds received
from the Transfer of Transferable Shares which Securityholder is entitled to
withdraw in any Quarter but which Securityholder does not withdraw in such
Quarter shall be added to the Transferable Shares and Proceeds which
Securityholder is entitled to withdraw in the next succeeding Quarter.

        (b) Except as set forth above, the restrictions on the Transfer of all
Escrow Amounts shall terminate, and Securityholder shall be entitled to Transfer
all Escrow Amounts held by the Escrow Agent, on the date that is the earlier of
(1) the first day of the sixth Quarter subsequent to the Closing (the "Release

      QUALCOMM COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF WIRELESS LOCATION LEADER SNAPTRACK

SAN DIEGO - March 2, 2000 - QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq: QCOM), pioneer and
world leader of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) digital wireless
technology, today announced that it has completed the acquisition of SnapTrack
Inc. of San Jose, Calif., a leader in wireless position location technology. The
acquisition provides QUALCOMM with SnapTrack's patent portfolio of nearly 50
patents, either issued or pending, that are critical to the efficient,
cost-effective deployment of Wireless Assisted GPS systems. QUALCOMM paid $1
billion in stock for the acquisition of SnapTrack, and the company is now a
wholly owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM.

"We are pleased to announce the completion of the acquisition of SnapTrack,"
said Dr. Irwin Mark Jacobs, chairman and CEO of QUALCOMM. "The combined
capabilities of QUALCOMM and SnapTrack will enable broad new applications for
mobile location-based services and wireless Internet systems."

The acquisition, which will be accounted for as a purchase, is expected to
result in a non-recurring charge for in-process R&D during the second quarter of
fiscal 2000. Excluding in-process R&D and the amortization of goodwill and other
acquired intangible assets which will be amortized over four years, the
acquisition is expected to be $.02 dilutive to QUALCOMM's earnings in fiscal
2000 and accretive to earnings in fiscal 2001.

The combined QUALCOMM and SnapTrack technology will accelerate the introduction
of powerful location-enabled mobile devices, including smart phones, PDAs and
pagers, which will help find wireless 9-1-1 callers for emergency purposes, or
provide customized location-specific services either directly to the user or via
wireless Internet applications and services. The solution is targeted for
wireless applications worldwide and will be designed and is patented to operate
in

<PAGE>   2

existing CDMA, PDC, GSM, TDMA and iDEN networks, and new third generation CDMA
systems.

SnapTrack's employees, including its strong engineering base, will remain in San
Jose, Calif. supporting a development center for wireless location products.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and
delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services
based on the Company's CDMA digital technology. The Company's business areas
include integrated CDMA chipsets and system software; technology licensing;
Eudora(R) email software for Windows(R) and Macintosh(R) computing platforms;
and satellite-based systems including OmniTRACS(R) and portions of the
Globalstar(TM) system. QUALCOMM owns patents which are essential to all of the
CDMA wireless telecommunications standards that have been adopted or proposed
for adoption by standards-setting bodies worldwide. QUALCOMM has licensed its
essential CDMA patent portfolio to more than 75 telecommunications equipment
manufacturers worldwide. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is
included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 1999 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on the
Nasdaq under the ticker symbol QCOM.

Except for the historical information contained herein, this news release
contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties,
including timely product development, the Company's ability to successfully
manufacture significant quantities of CDMA or other equipment on a timely and
profitable basis, and those related to performance guarantees, change in
economic conditions of the various markets the Company serves, as well as the
other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports, including
