ITEM 5.  OTHER EVENTS.

         THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE PROPOSED SEPARATION AND SPIN-OFF OF
QUALCOMM'S INTEGRATED CIRCUIT AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS,
INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED SEPARATION AND SPIN-OFF ON QUALCOMM'S
AND THE NEW COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING
CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION, THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED SPIN-OFF
ON QUALCOMM'S STOCK PRICE AND ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES,
THE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTION TO QUALCOMM AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS, AND
CHANGES IN BUSINESS CLIMATE OR MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER FACTORS WHICH COULD
MAKE THE PROPOSED SEPARATION OR SPIN-OFF UNADVISABLE. THIS REPORT ALSO
CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE RATE OF
GROWTH OF THE CDMA SUBSCRIBER POPULATION WILL DECLINE, RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, DEVELOPMENTS IN CURRENT OR
FUTURE LITIGATION AND THE TIMING AND RECEIPT OF LICENSE FEES AND ROYALTIES,
AS WELL AS OTHER RISKS INCLUDING THOSE DETAILED FROM TIME TO TIME IN
QUALCOMM'S SEC REPORTS, INCLUDING ITS REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED
SEPTEMBER 26, 1999 AND ITS MOST RECENTLY FILED FORM 10-Q.

         QUALCOMM Incorporated ("QUALCOMM" or the "Company") is planning to
spin-off its integrated circuit and system software solutions business. The
separation will create two separate companies and is designed to speed the
worldwide growth and development of CDMA wireless voice and data markets. These
companies will focus on critical drivers of growth for the wireless industry.
The new company will focus on developing and delivering innovative wireless
communications integrated circuits and system software solutions for the world's
leading handset and infrastructure manufacturers. QUALCOMM will focus on
developing and supporting the growth of CDMA technology and driving the
convergence of wireless data applications and Internet access, with the goal of
increasing royalties. In addition, QUALCOMM will further develop its other
existing businesses, including QUALCOMM Wireless Systems (OmniTRACS and
Globalstar) and QUALCOMM Digital Media (Government Systems, Digital Cinema and
Eudora).

         Following the separation, the new company will be the leading
developer worldwide of CDMA integrated circuits and system software solutions
for wireless voice and data products. According to Dataquest's most recent
analysis, the new company will be the largest fabless semiconductor company
in the world. The new company is temporarily called QUALCOMM Spinco, Inc.
("Spinco"), and will change its name in due course.

         As contemplated, QUALCOMM's integrated circuit and system software
solutions business would be transferred to Spinco and shares of Spinco would
be distributed to QUALCOMM stockholders in the form of a tax-free dividend.
QUALCOMM expects the spin-off to be completed by August 2001. The proposed
separation of the integrated circuit and system software solutions business
and the spin-off are each subject to final approval by the Company's Board of
Directors, a favorable ruling from the IRS regarding the tax-free nature of
the transaction and favorable market conditions.

INDUSTRY DEPLOYMENT OF CDMA FOR SECOND AND THIRD GENERATION WIRELESS SYSTEMS.

         Since first proposing CDMA technology to the wireless industry in
1989, QUALCOMM has been widely recognized as the pioneer of CDMA technology
for wireless applications. Many in the industry now agree that CDMA
technology is the wireless air interface of choice for the future growth of
wireless communications and plan to adopt CDMA for third generation networks.

                                      2
<PAGE>

         In just over five years, over 65 million subscribers covering 35
countries have adopted CDMA technology. Second generation cdmaOne networks
have been widely deployed around the world, including South Korea, the United
States, Japan and throughout Latin America. Third generation cdma2000 1X
networks are planned to enter commercial service in South Korea in 2000 and
in Japan, the United States and elsewhere in 2001. In addition, cdma2000 1xEV
(HDR) trials are planned in South Korea and Japan in 2000. NTT DoCoMo has
announced that an initial version of WCDMA will be deployed in some areas of
Japan in 2001.

QUALCOMM'S PIONEERING ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF CDMA.

         Since shortly after its formation in 1985, QUALCOMM has allocated
substantial resources to developing, patenting and commercializing the use of
CDMA technology in wireless communications applications. QUALCOMM's intellectual
property portfolio has been widely recognized as being necessary for cdmaOne,
cdma2000, 1xEV, 1Xplus, 1Xtreme and WCDMA.

         QUALCOMM has entered into royalty-bearing license agreements for
CDMA wireless applications with more than 80 major telecommunications
manufacturers, including Ericsson, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Hyundai, Intel, LGIC,
Lucent, Motorola, NEC, Nokia, Nortel, Philips, Samsung, Siemens and Sony. In
addition to license fees, QUALCOMM receives on-going royalties from its
licensees as they sell CDMA products provided that at least one claim of one
of QUALCOMM's licensed patents is being utilized. Moreover, approximately 15
of QUALCOMM's license agreements cover WCDMA applications and require
manufacturers to pay on-going royalties to QUALCOMM in connection with their
sales of WCDMA products, with royalty rates equivalent to the royalties that
are payable by them for cdmaOne and cdma2000 applications. The manufacturers
that have licensed some or all of QUALCOMM's essential patents for WCDMA
applications include: Ericsson, Hitachi, LGIC, Lucent, Matsushita, Motorola,
Nortel, Philips, Samsung, Sony, Sanyo and Toshiba. QUALCOMM expects increased
total licensing and royalty revenues as third generation CDMA standards are
deployed.

QUALCOMM'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARRANGEMENTS WITH SPINCO

         To give Spinco the ability to negotiate cross-licenses, gain
reasonable access to third party intellectual property and defend itself as
may be necessary, QUALCOMM will assign to Spinco a portion of its patents and
patent applications that are essential and/or useful to implement existing
and proposed CDMA standards. Following the spin-off, QUALCOMM's intellectual
property portfolio will consist of more than 1,000 U.S. patents and patent
applications, substantially all of which are essential to or useful in CDMA
wireless applications and some of which have applicability in other wireless
applications (such as position location technology). Because of the terms of
QUALCOMM's license agreements and due to the overall breadth and coverage of
its intellectual property portfolio, QUALCOMM believes that assignment of
patents and patent applications to Spinco will not compromise QUALCOMM's
existing or future licensing business, including the royalties payable to the
Company. In addition to filing for patent protection in the United States,
QUALCOMM has and will continue to actively file for patent protection around
the world and has received CDMA patents with broad coverage throughout most
of world, including China, Japan, Korea, Europe, Brazil, North America and
elsewhere.

         QUALCOMM's research and development team has a strong and proven track
record of innovation in wireless technologies. QUALCOMM intends to use its
substantial engineering

                                      3

<PAGE>

resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and
services and make them available to licensees to help grow the wireless
market and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities. In addition to
continuing to develop its own intellectual property portfolio, QUALCOMM will
have the right each year to select and receive ownership of a portion of
Spinco's patent applications. As a result of this relationship with Spinco
and QUALCOMM's own research and development efforts, QUALCOMM expects to be
able to extend the term of its royalty-bearing licenses and create new
licensing opportunities.

BENEFITS TO QUALCOMM OF THE SPIN-OFF.

     QUALCOMM expects to realize benefits from its complete separation from
Spinco, including the following:

- -                 REDUCED NEED FOR CROSS-LICENSES. Since QUALCOMM will no
                  longer be supplying CDMA integrated circuits, it will have
                  little or no need for third party cross-licenses. Accordingly,
                  QUALCOMM expects that it will be able to continue to license
                  its substantial intellectual property portfolio and continue
                  to collect royalty and license fee revenue in the future.

- -                 ELIMINATION OF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS WITH THE COMPANY'S
                  CUSTOMERS. Many of QUALCOMM's licensees currently also
                  purchase integrated circuit and system software solutions from
                  QUALCOMM, which from time to time has caused a conflict
                  between its licensing and integrated circuit and system
                  software solutions business. QUALCOMM expects that the
                  separation of Spinco from QUALCOMM may reduce these
                  conflicting interests.

- -                 GREATER STRATEGIC FOCUS. QUALCOMM's licensing business
                  benefits equally from the advancement and commercial
                  implementation of any of the proposed third generation
                  CDMA-based standards. QUALCOMM expects that following the
                  spin-off, it will have a sharper focus on enhancing the
                  competitive position of its business and a greater ability
                  to collaborate with manufacturers and carriers to develop,
                  implement and deploy the latest implementations of CDMA
                  technology for a variety of potential applications.

- -                 BETTER INCENTIVES FOR EMPLOYEES. QUALCOMM expects that the
                  motivation of its employees and the focus of its senior
                  management team will be strengthened by incentive compensation
                  programs tied to the market performance of its common stock.
                  The separation will enable QUALCOMM to offer its employees
                  compensation directly linked to the performance of QUALCOMM's
                  common stock, which QUALCOMM believes will enhance its ability
                  to attract and retain qualified personnel.


QUALCOMM'S MANAGEMENT AND BUSINESS FOLLOWING THE SPIN-OFF.

         QUALCOMM expects that its executive team after the spin-off will be
Dr. Irwin Jacobs, Chairman and CEO; Dr. Paul Jacobs, President; Tony
Thornley, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer; and Steve
Altman, Executive Vice President.  Dr. Irwin Jacobs will also be Chairman of
the Board of Directors of the spin-off company.  Although Dr. Irwin Jacobs
will provide

                                      4

<PAGE>

strategic and corporate governance to both companies, he will devote the
majority of his time to QUALCOMM as Chairman and CEO.

         Following the spin-off, QUALCOMM intends to (a) actively drive the
rapid deployment of CDMA-based systems and technologies and the growing
demand for high speed, high capacity, wireless data and Internet access
enabled by CDMA technology to grow its royalty stream, (b) continue to
broadly grant royalty-bearing licenses under its technology and patents for
CDMA and other wireless applications, (c) build upon its industry leading
position in data applications and services for the transportation industry,
(d) expand its long-term position as a profitable operator of mobile data
services and (e) create new businesses, such as the Digital Cinema system
currently under development.

DRIVING THE DEMAND OF CDMA TECHNOLOGY FOR WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA.

         Following the spin-off, QUALCOMM will retain significant engineering
resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA technology.
Using these resources, QUALCOMM expects to develop new CDMA-based technology,
participate in the formation of new wireless communications standards and
assist in deployments of working networks around the world. QUALCOMM believes
that by making its engineering resources available to manufacturers and
carriers, it can accelerate the deployment of all forms of CDMA and increase
its licensing and royalty revenues.

         With the continued convergence of wireless communications and
Internet access, QUALCOMM expects to see wireless usage and handset sales
continue their rapid growth as a multitude of new value-added services and
new devices with enhanced functionality and features are supplied to the
market. In addition to offering superior voice quality, QUALCOMM believes
that CDMA carriers will offer superior data services at a significantly lower
cost than other non-CDMA carriers because of, among other things, the
increased capacity, higher data rate and inherent security advantages offered
by CDMA as compared to other technologies. The more quickly that carriers
adopt and deploy CDMA, whether it is cdmaOne, cdma2000 or WCDMA, and increase
their market share over non-CDMA carriers, the more favorable the impact to
QUALCOMM's royalty revenue and other activities.

         Capitalizing upon its industry insight into wireless technologies
and trends, its experienced management team and its established industry
relationships, QUALCOMM intends to use the cash flow generated from its
royalty business to create, acquire or make strategic investments in new
businesses that are focused on increasing wireless usage and providing new
services, products or technology that will accelerate the demand for CDMA's
high quality voice and high speed, high capacity wireless data. QUALCOMM
intends not only that these new businesses be independently successful, but
also that they generate increased royalty revenue and licensing opportunities
through the general expansion of the CDMA market.

         Examples of existing or possible future investments in businesses
that are focused on the wireless market and which are intended to accelerate
the growth of the CDMA, include:

         STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN CARRIERS TO FURTHER DRIVE THE USAGE AND
ADOPTION OF CDMA. To help support CDMA carriers, as well as promote the use of
its technology, QUALCOMM has made and may continue to make equity investments in
CDMA carriers that it believes have economic and time to market advantages. For
example, QUALCOMM has equity positions in Korea

                                      5

<PAGE>

Telecom Freetel (nationwide Korean PCS carrier), Leap Wireless International,
Inc. and Vesper (a Brazilian carrier).

         STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN MANUFACTURERS TO DRIVE NEW APPLICATIONS OR
MARKETS FOR CDMA. QUALCOMM has made and may continue to make equity
investments in licensed device manufacturers to support the design and
introduction of new products that offer unique capabilities or open new
markets for CDMA technology. For example, QUALCOMM has equity positions in
Handspring (PDA products) and an option to acquire equity in a digital
wireless camera products company. Additionally, QUALCOMM may also make
strategic investments in selected manufacturers or start-up companies that
QUALCOMM believes possess unique capabilities or technology.

         JOINT VENTURES WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS. QUALCOMM has entered into
joint ventures with strategic partners that are designed to increase wireless
usage and dependence on wireless devices. For example, Wireless Knowledge, a
joint venture with Microsoft, was formed to provide secure, reliable wireless
access to business-critical information by connecting corporate resources to
any wireless device. QUALCOMM expects to continue to form such strategic
alliances in the future.

         INVESTMENTS IN VENTURE FUNDS OR INCUBATORS. QUALCOMM has made and
may continue to make investments in venture funds, incubators or other
entities that have the requisite expertise, resources and networking
capabilities to identify and create (or assist others in creating) products,
software or technologies focused on the wireless market. For example,
QUALCOMM has equity positions in Ignition and IdeaEdge.

         CDMA EQUIPMENT FINANCING. To facilitate the marketing and sale of
CDMA equipment by licensed manufacturers, QUALCOMM has provided, and may
continue to provide, equipment financing either directly to CDMA carriers or
to licensed manufacturers on commercially reasonable terms. By providing such
financing, QUALCOMM expects not only to receive a reasonable return on its
investment, but also to ensure the deployment of CDMA networks, which in turn
results in increased royalty revenue as the networks are deployed and built
out. QUALCOMM has provided equipment financing to Ericsson on a shared basis
with respect to their sale of CDMA infrastructure in Brazil, Mexico and
elsewhere.

FURTHER DEVELOP EXISTING BUSINESSES.

         Following the spin-off, QUALCOMM will continue to develop other
business opportunities that exist within the Company.

         QWBS. QWBS operates a global wireless data business focused on the
logistics industry, and has over 350,000 OmniTRACS units in operation. This
business maintains a 24-hour, 7-day a week service center with a redundant
back-up center. QWBS, which has been profitable since the early 1990s, provides
a complete mobile interactive information management system that includes
two-way mobile communications, satellite tracking and fleet management software.
The emerging Omni Express business extends this expertise into terrestrial data
markets, building a network of interconnections to wireless data networks that
have been deployed both domestically and internationally.

         EUDORA. QUALCOMM's multi-platform Eudora e-mail software products
have millions of users worldwide. QUALCOMM supports its Eudora products with
an experienced application, server, and user interface development team.
Approximately 800,000 users have migrated to a recently introduced
advertising-supported version of Eudora in the first six months following its
release. QUALCOMM also has developed proprietary XML-based content-serving
technology that caches content into the Eudora client software. The Company
also has introduced the Eudora Internet Suite, containing both a browser and
e-mail client for the Palm OS.

         GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS. QUALCOMM's Government Systems business provides
wireless development and analysis expertise to U.S. Government agencies. This
business maintains a team of software experts that support client-server
developments with potential commercial applications.

         DIGITAL CINEMA. The Company's Digital Cinema business is developing
a system for the electronic delivery of motion pictures to theatres around
the world. The information assurance architecture, including compression and
security technologies, developed by the Digital Cinema group can translate to
other types of digital content. The relationships QUALCOMM has developed
provide direct access to content creators and distributors. In June 2000, the
Company entered into a joint venture with Technicolor that will use
QUALCOMM's Digital Cinema technology.

         WIRELESS SYSTEMS. The Company's Wireless Systems division designs,
manufacturers, markets and deploys infrastructure and handset products for

        UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

         The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information has been prepared to give retroactive effect to the distribution
of our wholly owned subsidiary, QUALCOMM Spinco, Inc. (Spinco) to our
stockholders. The financial information is based on our unaudited historical
condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 25, 2000 and for the
nine month period then ended and on our audited historical consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999. The pro
forma condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine months ended
June 25, 2000 and the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999 give effect to the
distribution and the transactions described below as if they occurred as of
October 1, 1998. The related adjustments are described in the accompanying
notes.

         The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information
is based upon available information and certain assumptions set forth in the
notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information, which have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro
forma financial information. The distribution of Spinco common stock to our
stockholders may not occur. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial information does not purport to represent what our results of
operations or financial condition would actually have been had the
distribution of our investment in Spinco to our stockholders and the
transactions described below occurred as of October 1, 1998 or to project our
results of operations or financial condition for any future period or date.

         In May 1999, we sold certain assets related to our terrestrial-based
CDMA wireless infrastructure business. In connection with the sale, we
recorded $251 million in charges during fiscal 1999. We received
consideration of $98 million in cash on the closing date. Total consideration
will be adjusted based on a final determination of net assets, which has not
yet occurred.

         In February 2000, we sold certain assets related to our
terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer products business, including our
phone inventory, manufacturing equipment and customer commitments. In
connection with the sale, we recorded $83 million in charges during fiscal
2000. We received total consideration of $242 million in cash.

         In March 2000, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
SnapTrack, Inc. (SnapTrack), a developer of wireless position location
technology, in a transaction accounted for as a purchase. The purchase price
was approximately $1 billion, representing the value of the 5.8 million
QUALCOMM shares issued to effect the purchase, the value of vested and
unvested options and warrants exchanged at the closing date and estimated
transaction costs of $2 million. The preliminary allocation of purchase
price, based on the estimated fair values of the acquired assets and assumed
liabilities, reflected acquired goodwill of $948 million, purchased
in-process technology of $60 million and other intangible assets of $34
million. Tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were not material
to our financial statements. We expect to finalize the purchase price
allocation within one year and do not anticipate material adjustments to the
preliminary purchase price allocation. We will allocate to Spinco $629
million in goodwill, $60 million in purchased in-process technology and $19
million in other intangible assets related to SnapTrack's workforce, customer
base and completed technology. We will retain $319 million in goodwill and
$15 million in other intangible assets related to specific SnapTrack patents
that will not be transferred to Spinco. Goodwill and other intangible assets
resulting from the SnapTrack acquisition are amortized on a straight-line
basis over their estimated useful lives of four years. Purchased in-process
technology was expensed upon acquisition.
