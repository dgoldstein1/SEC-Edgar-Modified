              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (Unaudited)


1.   Basis of Presentation
     ---------------------

     The consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared by the
     Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote
     disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
     condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The Company
     believes the disclosures included in the unaudited consolidated condensed
     financial statements, when read in conjunction with the consolidated
     financial statements of the Company as of July 2, 1999 and notes thereto,
     are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

     The consolidated condensed financial statements reflect, in the opinion of
     management, all material adjustments necessary to summarize fairly the
     consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
     such periods.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

     The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended March
     31, 2000 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
     for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2000.

     The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52
     or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30.  Accordingly, fiscal
     1999 was 52 weeks and ended on July 2, 1999 and fiscal 2000 will be 52
     weeks and will end on June 30, 2000.

     Options to purchase 0.1 million shares and 1.6 million shares of common
     stock were outstanding during the quarter and nine months ended March 31,
     2000, respectively, but were not included in the computation of diluted net
     income per share because the options' exercise price was greater than the
     average market price of the common stock and, therefore, the effect would
     be antidilutive.  Options to purchase 1.6 million shares and 7.2 million
     shares of common stock were outstanding during the quarter and nine months
     ended April 2, 1999, respectively, but were not included in the computation
     of diluted net income per share because the options' exercise price was
     greater than the average market price of the common stock and, therefore,
     the effect would be antidilutive.

4.   Income Taxes
     ------------

     The effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for
     the nine months ended March 31, 2000 was 74% compared with a 32% effective
     tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for the nine months
     ended April 2, 1999.  The higher effective tax rate used to record the
     provision for income taxes for the nine months ended March 31, 2000
     resulted primarily from the effects of net non-deductible charges
     associated with the acquisition of the minority interest in Seagate
     Software, the acquisition of XIOtech Corporation ("XIOtech"), the net gain
     from the sales of SanDisk Corporation ("SanDisk") and VERITAS Software
     Corporation ("VERITAS") common stock and activity related to the Company's
     equity interest in VERITAS.  Excluding these items, and considering the
     effects of the Company's settlement of litigation with Rodime PLC (the
     "Rodime Settlement") and certain non-recurring restructuring costs, the pro
     forma effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for
     the nine months ended March 31, 2000 would have been 28%.  The pro forma
     effective tax rate of 28% is less than the statutory rate because a portion
     of the Company's anticipated foreign operating income is not subject to
     foreign income taxes and is considered to be permanently reinvested in non-
     U.S. operations.

6.   Restructuring Costs
     -------------------

     During the nine months ended March 31, 2000, the Company recorded
     restructuring charges totaling $184 million including $49 million recorded
     in the quarter ended March 31, 2000.  These charges were a result of a
     restructuring plan established to align the Company's global workforce and
     manufacturing capacity with existing and anticipated future market
     requirements and necessitated by the Company's improved productivity and
     operating efficiencies (the "fiscal 2000 restructuring plan").  These
     actions include workforce reductions, capacity reductions including closure
     of facilities or portions of facilities, write-off of excess equipment and
     consolidation of operations in the Company's recording media operations,
     disc drive assembly and test facilities, printed circuit board assembly
     manufacturing, recording head operations, software operations, customer
     service operations, sales and marketing activities, and research and
     development activities.  The restructuring charges were comprised of $60
     million for the write-off of excess manufacturing, assembly and test
     equipment formerly utilized in Singapore, Thailand and

                                       8
<PAGE>

     Northern California; $81 million for employee termination costs; $29
     million for the write-off of owned facilities located in Singapore; $7
     million in lease termination and holding costs; $5 million in renovation
     costs to restore facilities in Singapore and Northern California to their
     pre-lease condition; and $2 million in contract cancellations associated
     with one of the Singapore facilities. Prior to this period, there was no
     indication of permanent impairment of the assets associated with the
     closure and consolidation of facilities.

     In connection with the restructuring activities taken to date, the Company
     plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 21,800 primarily
     manufacturing employees.  Approximately 17,500 of the 21,800 employees had
     been terminated as of March 31, 2000.  As a result of employee terminations
     and the write-off of equipment and facilities in connection with the
     restructuring charges recorded during the nine months ended March 31, 2000
     related to the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan, the Company estimates that
     after completion of these restructuring activities, annual salary and
     depreciation expense will be reduced by approximately $118 million and $76
     million, respectively.  The Company may implement additional actions
     pursuant to the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan, and, if such additional
     actions are implemented, the Company anticipates that additional charges
     would be taken related to these actions. The Company expects the
     implementation of the fiscal 2000 restructuring plan will be substantially

     The Company has three operating segments, disc drives, software and tape
     drives, however, only the disc drive business is a reportable segment under
     the criteria of SFAS 131.  The "other" category in the following tables
     consists of tape drives, software, and out-of-warranty repair.  The Chief
     Executive Officer (the "CEO") has been identified as the

8.   Comprehensive Income (As amended June 14, 2000)
     --------------------

     During the quarter ended October 1, 1999, Gadzoox Networks Inc.
     ("Gadzoox"), a company in which Seagate Technology held a 19.89% interest
     as of that date, completed an initial public offering of its common stock.
     The Company is required to account for its investment under Statement of
     Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments
     in Debt and Equity Securities" ("SFAS 115").  The Company has identified
     this investment as "available-for-sale".  Under SFAS 115, an available-for-
     sale security is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and unrealized
     holding gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in a separate
     component of stockholders' equity called accumulated other comprehensive
     income, until realized.  For the nine months ended March 31, 2000, the
     Company recorded net unrealized gains on securities of $130 million, net of
     tax, with respect to its investment in Gadzoox.

     The recorded investment in SanDisk has been amended to revise the
     calculation of its fair value, unrealized holding gain and related taxes.
     As a result, the balance sheet caption amounts of other assets, deferred
     income tax liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income increased
     by $224 million, $88 million and $136 million, respectively. No other
     financial statements were affected by this matter. The Company has also

                                       10
<PAGE>

     updated information related to the decrease in the fair value of its
     investment in SanDisk to reflect recent sales and declines in market value
     from March 31, 2000 through June 9, 2000. Decreases in the fair value of
     its investment in Gadzoox have also been updated for the same period.

     During the quarter ended December 31, 1999, the Company identified its
     investment in SanDisk as "available-for-sale" after it had sold 2,000,000
     shares of stock it held in SanDisk, adjusted for a 2 for 1 stock split on
     February 23, 2000, resulting in an ownership percentage of 15.8% as of
     December 31, 1999.  The Company recorded an unrealized gain on securities
     of $285 million, net of $184 million of tax, to record its investment in
     SanDisk at fair value as of December 31, 1999.  For the nine months ended
     March 31, 2000, the Company recorded unrealized gains on securities of $298
     million, net of $192 million of tax, with respect to its investment in
     SanDisk.

     Between March 31, 2000 and June 9, 2000, the quoted market prices of
     SanDisk and Gadzoox common stocks declined.  As a result, the Company
     experienced a decrease in the fair values of its remaining investments in
     SanDisk and Gadzoox of $154 million and $62 million, respectively.  On an
     after tax basis, these unrealized losses were $93 million and $38 million,
     respectively.

     The components of comprehensive income, net of related tax, for the three
     and nine months ended March 31, 2000 and April 2, 1999 were as follows (in
     millions):

9.   Equity Investment in VERITAS Software Corporation
     -------------------------------------------------

     During the quarters ended October 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999, Seagate
     Software sold 18,523,502 and 9,000,000 shares, respectively, of VERITAS
     common stock, adjusted for 3 for 2 stock splits on November 22, 1999 and
     March 6, 2000, for proceeds of  $397 million and $437 million,
     respectively, net of underwriting discounts and commissions.  Seagate
     Software acquired such shares in connection with the contribution of its
     Network & Storage Management Group business to VERITAS in May 1999.  The
     sale of shares of VERITAS common stock by Seagate Software in the quarters
     ended October 1, 1999 and December 31, 1999 resulted in pre-tax gains of
     $193 million and $344 million, respectively.  As of March 31, 2000, Seagate
     Software held approximately 33% of the outstanding common stock of VERITAS.
     The Company accounts for its investment in VERITAS under the equity method
     and records its equity interest in VERITAS' net income (loss) on a one-
     quarter lag.

     Summarized income statement information for VERITAS for the three and nine
     months ended December 31, 1999 is as follows (in millions):

          Net loss                      (171)               (517)
</TABLE>

     The Company's recorded equity in the net income of VERITAS for the three
     and nine months ended March 31, 2000 was $12 million and $20 million,
     respectively, and differs from the Company's proportionate share of
     VERITAS' reported net loss for the three and nine months ended December 31,
     1999.  This difference is primarily because the Company eliminates from
     VERITAS' net income (loss) the effect of VERITAS' accounting for the
     Network & Storage Management Group business contribution, including
     VERITAS' amortization expense related to intangible assets.

     The Company's activity related to equity interest in VERITAS for the three
     and nine months ended March 31, 2000 consisted of the recorded equity in
     the net income of VERITAS of $12 million and $20 million, respectively, as
     described above, and the Company's amortization expense for goodwill and
     other intangible assets relating to the investment in VERITAS amounting to
     $86 million and $276 million, respectively.


10.  Seagate Software Reorganization
     -------------------------------

     On October 20, 1999, the stockholders of Seagate Software, a majority-owned
     subsidiary of the Company, approved  the merger of Seagate Daylight Merger
     Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, with and into Seagate
     Software.  Seagate Software's assets consisted of the assets of the
     Information Management Group ("IMG") and its investment in the common stock
     of VERITAS Software Corporation.  The merger was effected on October 20,
     1999.  As a result of the merger, Seagate Software became a wholly-owned

                                       12
<PAGE>

     subsidiary of the Company.  In connection with the merger, Seagate
     Software's stockholders and optionees received payment in the form of 3.23
     shares of the Company's common stock per share of Seagate Software common
     stock less any amounts due for the payment of the exercise price for such
     options.  All outstanding Seagate Software stock options were accelerated
     immediately prior to the merger.  Seagate Technology issued 9,124,046
     shares to optionees and minority stockholders of Seagate Software.

     In connection with the reorganization, Seagate Software also formed a
     wholly-owned subsidiary that assumed the name "Seagate Software, Inc."
     ("Software Operating Company").  Seagate Software transferred the IMG
     assets into Software Operating Company.  This new company, Software
     Operating Company, is now the operating entity for the IMG business.  In
     October 1999, a new stock option plan was established for Software
     Operating Company, and employees of the IMG business are eligible to
     participate in the plan.

     Seagate Software accounted for the exchange of shares of its common stock
     as the acquisition of a minority interest for Seagate Software common stock
     outstanding and vested more than six months held by employees and all stock
     held by former employees and consultants.  The fair value of the shares of
     Seagate Technology issued was $19 million and was recorded as purchase
     price and allocated to the assets and liabilities received.  The Company
     accounted for the exchange of shares of its common stock for stock options
     in Seagate Software held by employees and stock held and vested by
     employees less than six months as the settlement of an earlier stock award.
     During the quarter ended December 31, 1999, the Company recorded
     compensation expense of $284 million, plus $2 million in payroll taxes,
     related to the purchase of minority interest in Seagate Software.

11.  Acquisition of XIOtech Corporation
     ----------------------------------

     On January 28, 2000, the Company acquired XIOtech Corporation ("XIOtech"),
     a provider of virtual storage and Storage Area Network (SAN) solutions, for
     Seagate Technology common stock with a value of $359 million.  This
     acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the results
     of operations of XIOtech have been included in the consolidated financial
     statements from the date of acquisition.  The purchase price has been
     allocated based on the estimated fair market value of net tangible and
     intangible assets acquired as well as in-process research and development
     costs.  As a result of the acquisition, the Company incurred a one-time
     write-off of in-process research and development of $105 million. Goodwill
     and other intangibles arising from the acquisition are being amortized on a
     straight-line basis over periods ranging from four months to seven years.
     Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles is expected to be
     approximately $51 million the first year and approximately $47 million in
     subsequent years.  XIOtech's revenue and expenses are immaterial to the
     Company's consolidated revenue and expenses.

     The following is a summary of the purchase price allocation (in millions):

12.  Stock Purchase Agreement and Merger Agreement
     ---------------------------------------------

     On March 29, 2000, Seagate Technology, Seagate Software Holdings, Inc.
     ("Seagate Software") and Suez Acquisition Company (Cayman) Limited ("SAC"),
     an entity affiliated with, among others, Silver Lake Partners and Texas
     Pacific Group entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase
     Agreement"), and Seagate Technology, VERITAS and a wholly owned subsidiary
     of VERITAS entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization
     (the "Merger Agreement").

     Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, SAC has agreed to purchase, in exchange
     for $2 billion in cash, all of the assets of Seagate Technology and its
     consolidated subsidiaries, including Seagate's disc drive, tape drive and
     software businesses and operations, but

                                       14
<PAGE>

     excluding the approximately 128 million shares of VERITAS common stock
     currently held by Seagate Software and Seagate Technology's equity
     investments in Gadzoox Networks, SanDisk Corporation, CVC, Inc. and Dragon
     Systems, Inc., a privately held company. In addition, under the Stock
     Purchase Agreement, SAC has agreed to assume substantially all of the
     liabilities of Seagate Technology and its consolidated subsidiaries. This
     transaction is referred to herein as the SAC transaction.

     Under the Merger Agreement, immediately following and contingent upon the
     consummation of the SAC transaction, a wholly-owned subsidiary of VERITAS
     will merge with and into Seagate Technology, with Seagate Technology to
     survive the merger and to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of VERITAS. This
     transaction is referred to herein as the Merger. VERITAS is not acquiring
     Seagate Technology's disc drive business or any other Seagate operating
     business. In the Merger, the Seagate stockholders will receive merger
     consideration consisting of:

          -   Approximately 109.3 million shares of VERITAS common stock issued
          in exchange for the approximately 128 million shares of VERITAS common
          stock that Seagate currently holds,

          -   additional shares of VERITAS common stock issued in exchange for
          the investment securities, and, at VERITAS' election, for up to $750
          million in retained cash, and

          -   all cash on the Seagate balance sheet in excess of $800 million
          (including cash generated from the SAC transaction) and after giving
          effect to VERITAS retained cash, debt repayment, taxes and other
          liabilities.

     The Merger is intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization.

     On March 29, 2000, Seagate Technology, VERITAS and SAC entered into an
     Indemnification Agreement, pursuant to which these entities and certain
     other subsidiaries of Seagate Technology have agreed to certain
     indemnification provisions regarding tax and other matters that may arise
     in connection with the SAC transaction and the Merger. Also on March 29,
     2000, VERITAS and SAC entered into a letter agreement, pursuant to which
     VERITAS agreed to a no-shop provision and an alternative termination fee
     provision.

     All of the transactions contemplated by the SAC transaction and the Merger
     are herein referred to as the Veritas/Silver Lake transaction.  The
     Veritas/Silver Lake transaction is expected to close in the first quarter
     of fiscal year 2001, subject to the approval of VERITAS and Seagate
     stockholders, funding of the debt commitments and clearance by the U.S.
     Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as clearance under antitrust
     laws and other customary closing conditions. The Company expects that while
     the Veritas/Silver Lake transaction is pending, the value of Seagate common
     stock will depend primarily on the value of VERITAS common stock.


13.  Litigation
     ----------

     Following the Company's announcement of the Veritas/Silver Lake
     transaction, a number of stockholders filed lawsuits against the Company,
     the individual members of the Board of Directors and certain executive
     officers in both Delaware and California.  As of April 11,

                                       15
<PAGE>

     2000, 17 complaints had been filed in the Chancery Court of Delaware. In
     California, three complaints were filed in Santa Clara County Superior
     Court and two complaints were filed in Santa Cruz County Superior Court.
     The complaints in these jurisdictions each allege that the members of the
     Company's Board of Directors breached their fiduciary duties to the
     Company's shareholders by entering into the Veritas/Silver Lake
     transaction. The complaints also allege that the Company's directors and
     executive officers have conflicting financial interests and did not secure
     the highest possible price for the Company's shares. All the complaints are
     styled as class actions, and seek to enjoin the Veritas/Silver Lake
     transaction and secure damages from all defendants. The Company believes
     that none of the lawsuits has any merit and intends to defend all these
     claims vigorously.

     In late 1992, Rodime PLC filed a complaint alleging infringement on a
     certain patent.  The process of litigation ensued and elapsed through
     January 2000.  On January 18, 2000, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the
     Company's petition for certiorari.  On the following day, through a
     mediation process, the Company and Rodime agreed to a settlement amount of
     $45 million to bring the related litigation to an end.  As a result, a
     previously recorded estimate of related settlement costs was revised and a
     charge of $39 million was recorded in the three months ended December 31,
     1999.  See Part II, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a description of legal
     proceedings.
