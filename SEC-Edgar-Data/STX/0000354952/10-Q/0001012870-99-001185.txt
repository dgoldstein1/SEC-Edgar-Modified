1.   Basis of Presentation
     ---------------------

     The consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared by the
     Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote
     disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
     condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The Company
     believes the disclosures included in the unaudited consolidated condensed
     financial statements, when read in conjunction with the consolidated
     financial statements of the Company as of July 3, 1998 and notes thereto,
     are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

     The consolidated condensed financial statements reflect, in the opinion of
     management, all material adjustments necessary to summarize fairly the
     consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
     such periods.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

     The results of operations for the three month period ended October 2, 1998
     are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
     entire year ending July 2, 1999.

     The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52
     or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30.  Accordingly, fiscal
     1998 was 53 weeks and ended on July 3, 1998 and fiscal 1999 will be 52
     weeks and will end on July 2, 1999.

2.   Net Loss Per Share
     ------------------

     The net loss per share was computed using only the weighted average number
     of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  The following
     table sets forth the computation of net loss per share.

     3,1997, respectively, were not included in the net loss per share
     computation because the effect would be antidilutive.

4.   Income Taxes
     ------------

     The effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for
     the three months 

                                       7
<PAGE>
 
     ended October 2, 1998 was 43% compared with a 4% effective tax rate used to
     record the benefit from income taxes for the comparable period last year.
     The higher effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes
     for the three months ended October 2, 1998 resulted primarily from
     additional non-deductible charges associated with the acquisition of Quinta
     Corporation ("Quinta"). See note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed
     Financial Statements. The lower effective tax rate used to record the
     benefit from income taxes for the three months ended October 3, 1997
     resulted primarily from non-deductible charges incurred as a result of the
     acquisition of Quinta. Excluding the non-deductible charges from the Quinta
     acquisition, the pro forma effective tax rate used to record the provision
     for income taxes for the three months ended October 2, 1998 would have been
     28%. The pro forma effective tax rate of 28% is less than the statutory
     rate because a portion of the Company's anticipated foreign operating
     income is not subject to foreign income taxes and is considered to be
     permanently reinvested in non-U.S. operations.

6.   Restructuring Costs
     -------------------

     During fiscal 1998, the Company recorded restructuring charges aggregating
     $347 million.  These charges reflect steps the Company is taking to align
     worldwide operations with current market conditions and to improve the
     productivity of its operations and the efficiency of its development
     efforts.  The restructuring charges comprised $57 million for reduction of
     personnel due to closure or consolidation of certain operations, $78
     million for closure of excess facilities, $148 million to write off or
     write down equipment, intangibles and other assets whose value had become
     permanently impaired, and $64 million for contract cancellations and other
     expenses.

     In connection with this restructuring the Company currently expects a
     workforce reduction of approximately 15,000 employees.  Of the 15,000
     employees, 8,144 are involuntary terminations of regular, full-time
     employees, 1,528 are contract laborers, primarily engaged through temporary
     employment agencies, and the remainder represents attrition.  Approximately
     14,200 of the 15,000 employees, including 7,988 of the 8,144 involuntary
     terminations of regular, full-time employees, had been terminated as of
     October 2, 1998. The Company anticipates that the implementation of the
     restructuring plan will be substantially complete by the end of December
     1998.  The following table summarizes the Company's restructuring activity
     for the three months ended October 2, 1998 (in millions):

7.   Acquisition of Quinta
     ---------------------
    
     In April and June 1997, the Company invested an aggregate of $20 million to
     acquire approximately ten percent (10%) of the outstanding stock of Quinta,
     a developer of ultra-high capacity disc drive technologies, including a new
     optically-assisted Winchester (OAW) technology. In August 1997, the Company
     completed the acquisition of Quinta. Pursuant to the purchase agreement
     with Quinta, the shareholders of Quinta, other than Seagate, received cash
     payments aggregating $230 million upon the closing of the acquisition and
     were eligible to receive additional cash payments aggregating $96 million
     upon the achievement of certain product development and early production
     milestones.  Of the $96 million, $19 million was charged to operations in
     fiscal 1998.  Of the $19 million charged to operations, $5 million was paid
     in fiscal 1998.  In July 1998, the Company and Quinta amended the purchase
     agreement to eliminate the product development and early production
     milestones and provide that the former shareholders of Quinta will be
     eligible to receive the remaining $77 million and the $14 million that had
     been accrued but unpaid in fiscal 1998 in equal quarterly installments
     beginning September 30, 1998 and ending March 31, 2000.  In the quarter
     ended October 2, 1998, the Company recorded a charge to operations for the
     remaining $77 million.
     
8.   Foreign Currency Derivatives
     ----------------------------

     The Company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option
     contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency
     commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures
     primarily in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.  The goal of the Company's
     hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates
     on a portion of the Company's local currency cash flows and not to
     eliminate all short-term earnings volatility.  Because not all economic
     hedges qualify as accounting hedges, unrealized gains and losses may be
     recognized in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows.  This
     mismatch of accounting gains and losses and foreign currency cash flows was
     especially pronounced for the first and second quarters of fiscal 1998 as a
     result of the declines in the value of the Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit
     relative to the U.S. dollar.  Accordingly, the Company's results for the
     three months ended October 3, 1997 include other expenses of approximately
     $63 million for unrealized losses on foreign currency forward exchange
     contracts.  Based on uncertainty in the Southeast Asian foreign currency
     markets, the Company has temporarily suspended purchasing foreign currency
     forward exchange and option contracts for the Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit
     and Singapore dollar.

9.   Comprehensive Income
     --------------------

     As of July 4, 1998 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
     Standards No. 130 ("SFAS 130"), Reporting Comprehensive Income.  SFAS 130
     establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income
     and its components; however, the adoption of SFAS 130 had no impact on the
     Company's net income or stockholders' equity.  SFAS 130 requires unrealized
     gains or losses on the Company's 

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
     available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments,
     which prior to adoption were reported separately in stockholders' equity to
     be included in other comprehensive income.

     The components of comprehensive income, net of related tax, for the
     quarters ended October 2, 1998 and October 3, 1997 were as follows (in
     millions):


                                              October 2,       October 3,

10.  Subsequent Event
     ----------------

     The Company, its majority-owned subsidiary, Seagate Software, Inc. ("SSI")
     and SSI's Network & Storage Management Group, Inc. ("NSMG") subsidiary
     announced on October 5, 1998 that they had entered into an Agreement and
     Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan")  as of such date with Veritas Holding
     Corporation ("Newco") and Veritas Software Corporation ("VERITAS").
     VERITAS provides end-to-end storage management software solutions. The Plan
     provides for the contribution by the Company, SSI and certain of their
     respective subsidiaries to Newco of (a) the outstanding stock of NSMG and
     certain other subsidiaries of SSI, and (b) those assets used primarily in
     the network storage management business of SSI (the "NSMG Business"), in
     consideration for the issuance of shares of Common Stock of Newco to SSI
     and the offer by Newco to grant options to purchase Common Stock of Newco
     to certain of SSI's employees who become employees of Newco or its
     subsidiaries. As part of the Plan, Newco will also assume certain
     liabilities of the NSMG Business.  The Plan is structured to qualify as a
     tax-free exchange. The merger will be accounted for as a non-monetary
     transaction using the fair value of the assets exchanged.

     Upon consummation of the merger, Newco shall issue shares of Common Stock
     to SSI equal to approximately 40% of the fully diluted Common Stock
     equivalent equity 

                                       10
<PAGE>
 
     interests in Newco (assuming conversion of all convertible securities,
     including the VERITAS convertible debentures, and exercise of all assumed
     options and warrants) less that number of shares of Newco Common Stock
     issuable upon exercise of Newco options issued to the SSI employees who
     surrender their outstanding options to purchase shares of SSI's Common
     Stock. Upon consummation of the merger, the former security holders of
     VERITAS will be issued Newco securities representing approximately 60% of
     the fully diluted Common Stock equivalent equity interests in Newco.

     The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited
     to the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by
     Newco with the Securities and Exchange Commission, approval by the
     stockholders of VERITAS and SSI, the expiration or termination of the
     waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
     Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing
     conditions.

     SSI anticipates recording a substantial gain and certain expenses in
     connection with the merger.  The gain will be recorded in fiscal 1999.  The
     expenses will include a substantial one-time write-off of in-process
     research and development during fiscal 1999 as well as amortization of
     goodwill and intangibles over periods up to five years following the
     merger. The magnitude of the gain and expenses will depend on several
     factors, including the average stock price of Veritas around the date of
     the merger, the number of shares of stock exchanged and an independent
     valuation of Veritas' business.  SSI will account for its investment in
     Veritas using the equity method and currently anticipates the merger will
     be consummated in the third quarter of fiscal 1999.

     NSMG historically has had higher gross margins as a percent of sales than
     the Company.  Therefore, if the exchange with Veritas is consummated, it
     could result in lower gross margins for the Company.  The Company's gross
     margins for the quarter ended October 2, 1998 and the year ended July 3,
     1998 were 20.7% and 14.5% respectively.  Without NSMG, such gross margins
     would have been 18.4% and 12.6% respectively.

Certain Forward-Looking Information:
- ------------------------------------

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements include the statements
relating to the effective tax rate in the sixth paragraph under "Results of
Operations," the statements relating to the merger between Veritas and NSMG in
the seventh paragraph under "Results of Operations," the statement concerning a
possible charge to operations for the discontinuation of the operations of
Seagate Microelectronics Limited in the last paragraph under "Results of
Operations," the statements regarding capital expenditures in the third
paragraph under "Liquidity and Capital Resources," the statements below under
"Factors Affecting Future Operating Results" and the statements under "Part II
Other Information - Item 1. Legal Proceedings," among others.  These forward-
looking statements are based on current expectations and entail various risks
and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties
are set forth below under "Factors Affecting Future Operating Results."

Results of Operations:
- ----------------------

Revenue for the quarter ended October 2, 1998 was $1.553 billion, as compared
with $1.896 billion for the comparable year-ago quarter, and $1.575 billion for
the immediately preceding quarter ended July 3, 1998. The decrease in revenue
from the comparable year-ago quarter was due primarily to a continuing decline
in the average unit sales prices of the Company's products as a result of
intensely competitive market conditions, a lower level of unit shipments
reflecting continuing weakness in demand for the Company's disc drive products
and a shift in mix away from the Company's higher priced products. The decrease
in revenue from the immediately preceding quarter was due primarily to a
continuing decline in the average unit sales prices of the Company's products as
a result of intensely competitive market conditions and a shift in mix away from
the Company's higher priced products partially offset by a higher level of unit
shipments.  The Company expects that price erosion in the data storage industry
will continue for the foreseeable future.  This competition and continuing price
erosion could adversely affect the Company's results of operations in any given
quarter and such adverse effect often cannot be anticipated until late in any
given quarter.

Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 20.7% for the three months ended
October 2, 1998, compared with 15.6% for the comparable period last year and
18.9% for the immediately preceding quarter ended July 3, 1998. The increase in
gross margin as a percentage of revenue from both prior periods was primarily
due to cost savings as a result of the Company's restructuring activities and an
intensive program of cost reduction.  Reductions in costs from both prior
periods included lower overhead costs per unit, a reduction in material costs
per unit, reduced scrap and rework and lower warranty costs.  These cost
reductions were partially offset by the continuing decline in the average unit
sales prices of the Company's products as a result of intensely competitive
market conditions and a shift in mix away from the Company's higher capacity
disc drives.

                                       12
<PAGE>
 
Marketing and administrative expenses for the three months ended October 2, 1998
were $131 million an increase of $5 million when compared with the comparable
period last year and an increase of $3 million when compared with the
immediately preceding quarter ended July 3, 1998. These expenses represented
8.4% of revenue for the three months ended October 2, 1998 compared with 6.7%
for the comparable period last year and 8.1% for the immediately preceding
quarter.  The increase in expenses from the comparable year-ago quarter was
primarily due to a $7 million charge in the quarter ended October 2, 1998 in
connection with the separation agreement with the Company's former Chief
Executive Officer partially offset by decreases in other expenses.

    
The $77 million charge to unusual items in the quarter ended October 2, 1998 was
in connection with an amendment to the purchase agreement for the August 1997
acquisition of Quinta. Pursuant to that purchase agreement, the shareholders of
Quinta, other than Seagate, received cash payments aggregating $230 million upon
closing of the acquisition and were eligible to receive additional cash payments
aggregating $96 million upon the achievement of certain product development and
early production milestones.  Of the $96 million, $19 million was charged to
operations in fiscal 1998.  In July 1998, the Company and Quinta amended the
purchase agreement to eliminate the product development and early production
milestones, and provide that the former shareholders of Quinta will be eligible
to receive the remaining $77 million and the $14 million that had been accrued
but unpaid in fiscal 1998 in equal installments beginning September 30, 1998 and
ending March 31, 2000.  In the quarter ended October 2, 1998, the Company
recorded a charge to operations for the remaining $77 million.  The entire $96
million, comprising the $19 million charged to operations in fiscal 1998 and the
$77 million charged to operations in fiscal 1999, reflects research and
development expense.  See Note 7 to the consolidated condensed financial
statements.     

Net other income increased by $66 million for the three months ended October 2,
1998 when compared with the comparable period last year and decreased by $2
million from the immediately preceding quarter ended July 3, 1998.  The increase
in net other income from the comparable year-ago quarter was primarily due to
charges for mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter ended October 3, 1997 of
$63 million on certain of the Company's foreign currency forward exchange
contracts for the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit.  The decrease from the
immediately preceding quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the charge for
minority interest in the Company's majority-owned subsidiary in Shenzhen, China.

The effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for the
three months ended October 2, 1998 was 43% compared with a 4% effective tax rate
used to record the benefit from income taxes for the comparable period last
year.  The higher effective tax rate used to record the provision for income
taxes for the three months ended October 2, 1998 resulted primarily from
additional non-deductible charges associated with the acquisition of Quinta.
The lower effective tax rate used to record the benefit from income taxes for
the three months ended October 3, 1997 resulted primarily from non-deductible
charges incurred as a result of the acquisition of Quinta. Excluding the non-
deductible charges from the Quinta acquisition, the pro forma effective tax rate
used to record the provision for income taxes for the three months ended October
2, 1998 would have been 28%.  The pro forma effective tax rate of 28% is less
than the statutory rate because a portion of the Company's anticipated foreign
operating income is not subject to foreign income taxes and is considered to be
permanently reinvested in non-U.S. operations.  The Company expects its
effective tax rate on operating income for the remaining quarters of fiscal 1999
to approximate 28%.  However, the actual effective tax rate may vary from 28%
if, for 

                                       13

example, the Company incurs charges in connection with future acquisitions.

The Company, its majority-owned subsidiary, Seagate Software, Inc. ("SSI") and
SSI's Network & Storage Management Group, Inc. ("NSMG") subsidiary announced on
October 5, 1998 that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan")  as of such date with Veritas Holding Corporation
("Newco") and Veritas Software Corporation ("VERITAS").  VERITAS provides end-
to-end storage management software solutions. The Plan provides for the
contribution by the Company, SSI and certain of their respective subsidiaries to
Newco of (a) the outstanding stock of NSMG and certain other subsidiaries of
SSI, and (b) those assets used primarily in the network storage management
business of SSI (the "NSMG Business"), in consideration for the issuance of
shares of Common Stock of Newco to SSI and the offer by Newco to grant options
to purchase Common Stock of Newco to certain of SSI's employees who become
employees of Newco or its subsidiaries. As part of the Plan, Newco will also
assume certain liabilities of the NSMG Business.  The Plan is structured to
qualify as a tax-free exchange. The merger will be accounted for as a non-
monetary transaction using the fair value of the assets exchanged.  Upon
consummation of the merger, Newco shall issue shares of Common Stock to SSI
equal to approximately 40% of the fully diluted Common Stock equivalent equity
interests in Newco (assuming conversion of all convertible securities, including
the VERITAS convertible debentures, and exercise of all assumed options and
warrants) less that number of shares of Newco Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of Newco options issued to the SSI employees who surrender their
outstanding options to purchase shares of SSI's Common Stock.  Upon consummation
of the merger, the former security holders of VERITAS will be issued Newco
securities representing approximately 60% of the fully diluted Common Stock
equivalent equity interests in Newco.  The merger is subject to a number of
conditions, including but not limited to the effectiveness of a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Newco with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, approval by the stockholders of VERITAS and SSI, the expiration or
termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary
closing conditions.  SSI anticipates recording a substantial gain and certain
expenses in connection with the merger.  The gain will be recorded in fiscal
1999.  The expenses will include a substantial one-time write-off of in-process
research and development during fiscal 1999 as well as amortization of goodwill
and intangibles over periods up to five years following the merger. The
magnitude of the gain and expenses will depend on several factors, including the
average stock price of Veritas around the date of the merger, the number of
shares of stock exchanged and an independent valuation of Veritas' business.
SSI will account for its investment in Veritas using the equity method and
currently anticipates the merger will be consummated in the third quarter of
fiscal 1999.  NSMG historically has had higher gross margins as a percent of
sales than the Company.  Therefore, if the exchange with Veritas is consummated,
it could result in lower gross margins for the Company.  The Company's gross
margins for the quarter ended October 2, 1998 and the year ended July 3, 1998
were 20.7% and 14.5% respectively.  Without NSMG, such gross margins would have
been 18.4% and 12.6% respectively.

The Company is discontinuing the manufacture of microchips used in its disc
drive products and therefore is seeking a buyer for its Seagate Microelectronics
Limited subsidiary in Livingston, Scotland.  Depending upon its ability to
identify a qualified buyer as well as other factors, the Company may be required
to take a charge to operations related to this facility in its fiscal quarter
ending January 1, 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:
- --------------------------------      
 
At October 2, 1998, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments totaled $1.874 billion, an increase of $47 million from the July 3,
1998 balance.  This increase was primarily a result of net cash provided by
operating activities, partially offset by expenditures for property, equipment
and leasehold improvements.  Until required for other purposes, the Company's
cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with
remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase, while its
short-term investments primarily consist of readily marketable debt securities
with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the time of purchase.

As of October 2, 1998, the Company had committed lines of credit of $63 million
which can be used for standby letters of credit and bankers' guarantees.  At
October 2, 1998, these lines of credit were fully utilized.

The Company expects investments in property and equipment in the current fiscal
year to approximate $700 million, of which approximately $123 million had been
incurred as of October 2, 1998.  The Company plans to finance these investments
from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.  The $123 million
year-to-date investment comprised $59 million for manufacturing facilities and
equipment related to the Company's subassembly and disc drive final assembly and
test facilities in the United States, Far East and the United Kingdom; $51
million for manufacturing facilities and equipment for the recording head
operations in the United States, Northern Ireland and Malaysia; $9 million for
expansion of the Company's thin-film media operations in California, Singapore,
Northern Ireland and Mexico; and $4 million for other purposes.

Factors Affecting Future Operating Results
- ------------------------------------------

We compete in the data storage industry, and there are a number of factors that
in the past have affected all of the companies in our industry including us.
Many of these factors may also impact our business in the future.

Data Storage Industry Risks

Our products are components in computer systems.  The demand for computer
systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on
the demand for disc drive and tape drive products such as ours in any given
period.  In the past, unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems have
generally caused sharp declines in demand for disc drives and tape drive
products.  We expect that this situation will occur again in the future.  In our
industry, the supply of drives periodically exceeds demand.  When this occurs
the oversupply of available products causes higher than anticipated inventory
levels and intense price competition.

Fluctuations in Quarterly Results

We often experience a high volume of sales at the end of the quarter, so we may
not be able to determine that our fixed costs are too high relative to sales
until late in any given quarter.  Since this happens late in the quarter, we do
not have enough time to reduce these costs.  As a result, we would not be as
profitable or may even incur a loss.  In addition, Seagate Technology's
operating results have been and may in the future be subject to significant
quarterly fluctuations as a result of a number of other factors including:

     . the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major customers,

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
     . our product mix,
     . changes in the prices of our products,
     . manufacturing delays or interruptions,
     . acceptance by customers of competing technologies in lieu of our
       products,
     . variations in the cost of components for our products,
     . limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited
       number of suppliers,
     . our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match revenues in any quarter
       because of our vertical manufacturing strategy,
     . the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of
       our products and the effective price of such products to foreign
       consumers
     . competition and consolidation in the data storage industry and
     . general economic conditions.

For example, revenue decreased to $1.553 billion in the first quarter of fiscal
1999 from $1.896 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 1998 as a result of
increased competition which resulted in significant price decreases and
continuing weakness in demand for Seagate Technology's disc drive products. Our
future operating results may also be adversely affected if Seagate Technology
receives an adverse judgment or settlement in any of the legal proceedings to
which we are a party.

Competition

Even during periods when demand is stable, the data storage industry is
intensely competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a
product.  We expect that our competitors will offer new and existing products at
lower prices if necessary to gain or retain market share and customers. We also
expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable
future.  Because we may need to reduce our prices to retain our market share,
the competition could adversely affect our results of operations in any given
quarter.  We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense
competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including the other
leading independent disc drive manufacturers, as well as large integrated
multinational manufacturers such as:

     . Fujitsu Limited
     . International Business Machines Corporation
     . NEC Corporation
     . Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and
     . Toshiba Corporation.

We also face indirect competition from present and potential customers,
including several of the computer manufacturers listed above,  that continuously
evaluate whether to manufacture their own drives or purchase them from outside
sources. If our customers decide to manufacture their own drives, it could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We also compete with manufacturers of products that use alternative data storage
and retrieval technologies.  Products based upon such alternative technologies,
including optical recording technology and semiconductor memory (flash memory,
SRAM and DRAM), may compete with our products.

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against
current or future competitors.  If we fail to compete successfully, our
business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely
affected.

Risks Associated with New Product Development

Our products are used in combination with other hardware, such as
microprocessors, and other software.  We had research and development expenses
of $420 million, $459 million and $585 million in fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively.  Customers have demanded new generations of drive products as
advances in other hardware components and software have created the need for
improved storage products with features such as increased storage capacity or
more advanced technology.  As a result, the life cycles of our products have
been shortened, and we have been required to constantly develop and introduce
new drive products on a cost-effective and timely basis.

When we develop new disc and tape drive products with higher capacity and more
advanced technology, our operating results may decline because the increased
difficulty and complexity associated with producing such disc drives increases
the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems.  If our products
suffer increases in failures, are of low quality or are not reliable, customers
may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and
scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase.  In addition, a decline
in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with
other disc and tape drive manufacturers.

Our future success will also require strong demand by consumers and businesses
for computer systems, storage upgrades to computer systems and multimedia
applications, such as digital video and video-on-demand.   If delivery of our
new products or those computer systems into which our products are integrated is
delayed, consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from our
competitors or wait to make their purchases if they want to buy the new product.
If customers hold back in anticipation of a new product, or buy from a
competitor instead, our operating results may be significantly adversely
impacted.

Consumers have shown that they want to purchase personal computers costing less
than $1000.  We are developing low cost disc drives to meet the demand for disc
drives that are components of low cost personal computers.  However, we may not
be able to produce disc drives that meet our quality and performance standards
at a cost low enough to yield gross margins comparable to those of our current
overall product mix.

We discontinued production of disc drives that use smaller media than 3.5 inches
in January 1998.  We are continuing research and development of smaller drives,
because we believe that to compete successfully to supply components for mobile,
laptop, notebook and ultraportable computers, we must supply a smaller product.
We intend to re-enter this market with a durable, low power application in the
future.

Risks from Vertical Integration of Manufacturing Operations

The cost, quality and availability of certain components, including heads,
media, application specific integrated circuits, motors, printed circuit boards
and custom semiconductors are critical to the successful production of disc
drives.  Our strategy of vertical integration has allowed us to internally
manufacture many of the critical components used in our products.  We have
pursued a strategy of vertical integration of our manufacturing processes in
order to reduce costs, control 

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
quality and assure availability and quality of certain components.

Vertical integration entails a high level of fixed costs and requires a high
volume of production and sales to be successful.  During periods of decreased
production, such as we are now experiencing, these high fixed costs have had,
and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on Seagate Technology's
operating results and financial condition.  In addition, a strategy of vertical
integration has in the past and could continue to delay Seagate Technology's
ability to introduce products containing market-leading technology.

We also rely on independent suppliers for certain components.   In the past we
have experienced production delays when we were unable to obtain sufficient
quantities of certain components.  Any prolonged interruption or reduction in
the supply of any key components could have a material adverse effect on Seagate
Technology's business, operating results and financial condition.  Seagate
Technology relies on single or limited source suppliers for certain components
used in our products. We may not be able to obtain components that meet our
specifications and quality standards at prices that enable us to earn a profit
on the finished products.  In the past, shortages  have occurred in the market
for certain components, including heads, media, application specific integrated
circuits and motors. As a result, certain suppliers substantially increased the
price of such components, and Seagate is currently incurring increased costs for
certain of these components as a result of supply shortages. If we experience
any extended interruption or reduction in the supply of any key components, our
business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

Customer Requirements and Concentration

The data storage industry has been characterized by large volume OEM purchase
agreements and large distributor orders. Typically, Seagate's OEM purchase
agreements permit customers to  cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates
without significant penalties. In the past, orders from  many of Seagate's OEM
customers were canceled or delivery schedules were delayed as a result of
changes in customer requirements. These delays have had a material adverse
effect on Seagate's results of operations in the past, and may again in the
future.  Distributors typically furnish Seagate with non-binding indications of
their near-term requirements, with product deliveries based on weekly
confirmations. To the extent actual orders from distributors decrease from their
non-binding forecasts, such variances could have a material adverse effect on
Seagate's business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks from International Operations

We have significant offshore operations including manufacturing facilities,
sales personnel and customer support operations.  We have manufacturing
facilities in Singapore, Thailand, the People's Republic of China, Scotland,
Ireland, and Malaysia in addition to those in the United States.  Our offshore
operations are subject to certain inherent risks including:

     .  fluctuations in currency exchange rates, such as the $76 million charge
        to
     .  income we incurred in fiscal 1998 from marking our hedge positions to
        market
     .  longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries
     .  difficulties in staffing and managing international manufacturing
        operations
     .  seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in Europe
        and certain other countries
     .  increases in tariffs and duties, price controls, restrictions on foreign
        currencies and 

                                       18
<PAGE>
 
        trade barriers imposed by foreign countries and
     .  political unrest, particularly in areas in which we have manufacturing
        facilities.

These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition in the future.

Our products are priced in U.S. dollars even when sold to customers who are
located abroad.  The currency instability in the Asian and other financial
markets may make our products more expensive than products sold by other
manufacturers that are priced in one of the affected currencies.  Therefore,
foreign customers may reduce purchases of our products.  We anticipate that the
recent turmoil in financial markets and the recent deterioration of the
underlying economic conditions in certain countries, including those in Asia,
may have an impact on our sales to customers located in or whose end-user
customers are located in those countries due to:

   .   the impact of currency fluctuations on the relative price of our products
   .   restrictions on government spending imposed by the International Monetary
       Fund (the "IMF") in those countries receiving the IMF's assistance
   .   customers' reduced access to working capital to fund purchases of disc
       drive components or software, such as our products, due to:
       .   higher interest rates
       .   reduced bank lending due to contractions in the money supply or  the
           deterioration in the customer's or its bank's financial condition or
       .   the inability to access other financing

Risks from the Spin-off of the Network & Storage Management Group

We consolidated our software businesses into a single entity called Seagate
Software in 1996.  Seagate Software's business consists of two primary
divisions, the Network & Storage Management Group ("NSMG") and the Information
Management Group ("IMG").  We announced on October 5, 1998 that we will
contribute NSMG to a newly formed company that will also include Veritas
Software Corporation.  Our Seagate Software subsidiary and the employees of NSMG
who hold stock options in Seagate Software will receive 40% of the fully diluted
equity in the new company.

We face a number of risks prior to and after the closing of the spin-off of the
Network & Storage Management Group including:

       .   our management resources may be distracted from the day to day
           operations by the transaction
       .   employees of the Network & Storage Management Group may not want to
           become employees of the new company
       .   employees of the Information Management Group may be distracted by
           concerns about whether we continue to operate that business or spin
           it off
       .   the Network & Storage Management Group's customers may delay or
           cancel orders due to uncertainty about the spin-off
       .   the ongoing OEM relationship with the Network & Storage Management
           Group and our tape drive operations may be disrupted
       .   we have agreed not to compete in certain storage management software

                                       19
<PAGE>
 
       .   businesses for a specified period of time after the
           closing and may not be able to benefit from future opportunities
           in that market

       .   we will not have control over the management of the new company,
           although initially we will have two representatives on its board
           of directors and

       .   we will be limited from liquidating our interest in the new company
           for a certain period of time.  Thereafter, if we choose to do so,
           we will be required to sell our interest in the new company in
           small increments to comply with certain Securities and Exchange
           Commission rules or to bear the expense of filing a registration
           statement.

Acquisitions

We intend to continue our expansion into complementary data technology
businesses through internal growth as well as acquisitions.  Acquisitions
involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the
operations and products of the acquired businesses and the potential loss of key
employees or customers of the acquired businesses.  We expect that the Company
will continue to incur substantial expenses as we acquire other businesses
including charges for the write-off of in-process research and development.  Our
operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future
because of the timing of such write-offs.  For example, we incurred a charge to
operations in the first quarter of fiscal 1998 of approximately $214 million for
the write-off of in-process research and development related to our acquisition
of Quinta Corporation and we anticipate a substantial charge to operations later
in fiscal 1999 for the write-off of in-process research and development related
to the merger of NSMG with Veritas.

Risks of Systems Failures

Our operations are dependent on our ability to protect Seagate Technology's
computer equipment and the information stored in its databases from damage by
fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized
intrusion and other catastrophic events.  We believe that we have taken prudent
measures to reduce the risk of interruption in our operations.  However, we
cannot be sure that these measures are sufficient.  Any damage or failure that
causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on
Seagate Technology's business, results of operations and financial condition.

Year 2000 Risks

The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using two
digits rather than four to define the applicable year.  Computer programs that
have date-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900
rather than the year 2000.  We consider a product to be in "Year 2000
compliance" if

       .   the product's performance and functionality are unaffected by
           processing of dates prior to, during and after the year 2000, and
       .   all products (for example hardware, software and firmware) used with
           the product properly exchange accurate date data with it.

 Seagate's Products

We are assessing the capability of our products to determine whether or not they
are in Year 2000 compliance.  Although we believe our disc and tape drive
products and certain of its software products are in Year 2000 compliance, we
have determined that certain of our software 

                                       20
<PAGE>
 
products are not and will not be Year 2000 compliant. We are taking measures to
inform our customers that those products are not and will not be Year 2000
compliant. To assist our customers in evaluating their Year 2000 issues, our
Seagate Software subsidiary has developed a list that indicates those products
that are Year 2000 compliant as stand-alone products. The list is located on
Seagate Software's World Wide Web page and is periodically updated when
assessment of the Year 2000 compliance of additional products is completed. To
date, the costs we have incurred related to these programs have been immaterial.

However, the assessment of whether a complete system will operate correctly
depends on the BIOS capability and software design and integration, and for many
end-users this will include BIOS, software and components provided by companies
other than Seagate Technology or Seagate Software. We consider a disc drive or
tape product to be Year 2000 capable if when used properly and in conformity
with the product information provided by Seagate Technology, our product will
accurately store, display, process, provide and/or receive data from, into and
between 1999 and 2000, including leap year calculations if all other technology
used in combination with the Seagate disc drive or tape product properly
exchanges date data with the Seagate product.

We do not believe Seagate Technology is legally responsible for costs incurred
by customers related to ensuring such customers' or end-users' Year 2000
capability. Nevertheless, we are incurring various costs to provide customer
support and customer satisfaction services regarding Year 2000 issues and
anticipates that these expenditures will continue in fiscal 1999 and thereafter.
In addition, we have contacted our major customers to determine whether their
products into which Seagate Technology's products have been and will be
integrated are Year 2000 compliant. We have received assurances of Year 2000
compliance from a number of those customers.  Many other customers have not
responded and are under no contractual obligation to provide us with Year 2000
compliance information. We are taking steps with respect to new customer
agreements to ensure that the customers' products and internal systems are Year
2000 compliant.

We anticipate that substantial litigation may be brought against vendors,
including Seagate Technology, of all component products of systems that are
unable to properly manage data related to the Year 2000.  Our customer
agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our liability for such
claims.  It is possible, however, that these measures will not provide
protection from liability claims, as a result of existing or future federal,
state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions.  If any
such claims are brought against Seagate Technology, regardless of their merit,
our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially
adversely affected from factors that include increased warranty costs, customer
satisfaction issues and the costs of potential lawsuits.

 Seagate's Systems

We have also initiated a comprehensive program to address Year 2000 readiness in
our internal systems and with our customers and suppliers.  Our program has been
designed to address our most critical internal systems first and to gather
information regarding the Year 2000 compliance of products supplied to Seagate
Technology and into which our products are integrated. Assessment and
remediation are proceeding in tandem, and we intend to have our critical
internal systems in Year 2000 compliance by July 3, 1999, the first day of
Seagate Technology's fiscal year 2000.  These activities are intended to
encompass all major categories of systems in use by Seagate Technology,
including manufacturing, engineering, sales, finance and human resources.  

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
To date, we have not incurred material costs related to assessment and
remediation of Year 2000 readiness. We currently expect that the total cost of
our Year 2000 readiness programs, excluding redeployed resources, will not
exceed $10 million over the next fiscal year. This total cost estimate does not
include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the costs of
internal software or hardware replaced in the normal course of business. The
total cost estimate is based on the current assessment of Seagate Technology's
Year 2000 readiness needs and is subject to change as the projects proceed.

We are installing and testing new computer software for Seagate Technology's
financial, accounting, inventory control, order processing and other management
information systems.  In the course of these upgrades we are identifying Year
2000 dependencies in such systems and are implementing changes to such systems
to make them Year 2000 compliant. The successful implementation of these new
systems is crucial to the efficient operation of Seagate Technology's business.
We cannot provide any assurance that we will implement Seagate Technology's new
systems in an efficient and timely manner or that the new systems will be
adequate to support Seagate Technology's operations. Problems with installation
or initial operation of the new systems could cause substantial management
difficulties in operations planning, financial reporting and management and thus
could have a material adverse effect on Seagate Technology's business, financial
condition and results of operations. We do not expect the cost of bringing our
systems into Year 2000 compliance to have a material effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

We have also initiated formal communications with our significant suppliers and
financial institutions to determine the extent to which Seagate Technology is
vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remedy their own Year 2000 issues.
To date we have contacted our significant suppliers and financial institutions
and have received assurances of Year 2000 compliance from a number of those
contacted.  However, most of our suppliers are under no contractual obligation
to provide such information to us.  We are taking steps with respect to new
supplier agreements to ensure that the suppliers' products and internal systems
are Year 2000 compliant.  While we currently expect that the Year 2000 issues
will not pose significant operational problems, we could experience material
adverse effects on our business if the implementation of new systems is delayed.
We could also experience material adverse effects on our business if  we fail to
fully identify all Year 2000 dependencies in Seagate Technology's systems and in
the systems of our suppliers, customers and financial institutions.  Those
material adverse effects could include delays in the delivery or sale of our
products.  Therefore, we are developing contingency plans for continuing
operations in the event such problems arise.

Impacts of Volatile Stock Price

Our stock price has varied greatly as has the volume of shares of Seagate
Technology's Common Stock that are traded.  We expect these fluctuations to
continue due to factors such as:

       .   announcements of new products, services or technological innovations
           by us or our competitors
       .   announcements of major restructurings by us or our competitors.
           quarterly variations in our results of operations,
       .   changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community
           and speculation in the press or investment community
       .   general conditions in the data storage industry or the personal
           computer industry
       .   changes in our revenue growth rates or the growth rates of our
           competitors

                                       22
<PAGE>
 
       .   sales of large blocks of our stock


The stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume
fluctuations.  Many technology companies have experienced such fluctuations.  In
addition, our stock price may be affected by general market conditions and
domestic and international macroeconomic factors unrelated to Seagate
Technology's performance.  Often such fluctuations have been unrelated to the
operating performance of the specific companies. The market price of our common
stock may experience significant fluctuations in the future.

Risks from Conversion to Single European Currency

On January 1, 1999, certain member states of the European Economic Community
will fix their respective currencies to a new currency, the Single European
Currency ("Euro").  On that day the Euro will become a functional legal currency
within these countries.  During the three years beginning on January 1, 1999,
business in these countries will be conducted both in the existing national
currency, such as the French Franc or the Deutsche Mark, as well as the Euro.
Companies operating in or conducting business in these countries will need to
ensure that their financial and other software systems are capable of processing
transactions and properly handling the existing currencies and the Euro.  We are
still assessing the impact that the introduction and use of the Euro will have
on our internal systems.  We will take corrective actions based on such
assessment but do not presently expect that introduction and use of the Euro
will materially affect our foreign exchange and hedging activities or use of
derivative instruments or will result in any material increase in our costs.
While we will continue to evaluate the impact of the Euro introduction over
time, based on currently available information, we do not believe that the
introduction of the Euro will have a material adverse impact on Seagate
Technology's financial condition or overall trends in results of operations.

                               OTHER INFORMATION


Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
         -----------------

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements relate to the Company's legal
proceedings described below.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and may result
in adverse rulings or decisions.  Additionally, the Company may enter into
settlements or be subject to judgments which may, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations.  Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements.

Patent Litigation
- -----------------

In November 1992, Rodime, PLC ("Rodime") filed a complaint in Federal Court for
the Central District of California, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. B1
4,638,383 and various state law unfair competition claims.  It was the opinion
of the Company's patent counsel that the Company's products do not infringe any
valid claims of the Rodime patent in suit and thus the Company refused Rodime's
offer of a license for its patents.  Other companies, however, such as IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and a number of Japanese companies have reportedly made payments
to and taken licenses from Rodime.  On October 24, 1997 the Court entered a
Final Judgment against Rodime and in favor of Seagate.  Rodime  appealed from
the final judgment, and arguments on appeal were heard by the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit on September 3, 1998.  The Company intends to vigorously
defend itself in the appeal brought by Rodime.

On October 5, 1994, a patent infringement action was filed against the Company
by an individual, James M. White, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California for alleged infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,673,996
and 4,870,519.  Both patents relate to air bearing sliders.  Prior to the filing
of the lawsuit, the Company filed a Petition for Reexamination of U.S. Patent
No. 4,673,996 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") and
this Petition was granted shortly after the lawsuit was filed.  Subsequently,
the Company filed a Petition for Reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 4,870,519.
This second petition was also granted by the PTO.  The District Court stayed the
action pending the outcome of the Reexaminations.  Both patents have completed
reexamination and the stay of the action has been lifted.  Mr. White's lawyers
filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the sale of certain of
the Company's products.  The Court denied the motion on July 1, 1997.  On April
27, 1998, the Court entered an order establishing a construction of the claims
in Mr. White's patents which is broader than the construction which the Company
advocated, and on June 25, 1998, the Court denied reconsideration of the April
27 order.  The Court has set March 8, 1999 as the date for commencement of the
trial in this action.  It is the opinion of the Company's patent counsel that
the Company's products do not infringe any valid or enforceable claims of the
patents involved in the suit.  The Company intends to vigorously defend itself
against any and all charges of infringement of these patents.

On December 16, 1996, a patent infringement action was filed against the Company
by an individual, Virgle Hedgcoth, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California, 

                                       24
<PAGE>
 
San Jose Division, for alleged infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,735,840;
5,082,747; and 5,316,864. These patents relate to sputtered magnetic thin-film
recording discs for computers and their manufacture. The Company answered the
complaint denying infringement, alleging that the patents are invalid and
unenforceable, and counterclaiming for declaratory judgment that a fourth
Hedgcoth patent, No. 4,894,133, is invalid, unenforceable and not infringed.
Additionally, on July 1, 1997, Mr. Hedgcoth filed a patent infringement action
against the Company in the same Court for alleged infringement of a fifth
patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,262,970, issued May 6, 1997. Mr. Hedgcoth passed away
on April 8, 1998, and the Court subsequently substituted Susan Ann Alexander
Hedgcoth as a party Plaintiff in place of Mr. Hedgcoth. The Court has set a
trial date of March 29, 1999 for determining the dates of invention for Mr.
Hedgcoth's patents-in-suit, and a trial date of November 1, 1999 for trial of
all remaining issues. It is the opinion of the Company's patent counsel that the
Company's products do not infringe any valid or enforceable claims of the
patents in the two actions, and that the claims of the patents in the two
actions are invalid or unenforceable. The Company intends to vigorously defend
itself against any and all charges of infringement of Mr. Hedgcoth's patents.

Papst Licensing, GmbH, has given the Company notice that it believes certain
former Conner Peripherals, Inc. ("Conner") disc drives infringe several of its
patents covering the use of spindle motors in disc drives.  It is the opinion of
the Company's patent counsel that the former Conner disc drives do not infringe
any claims of the patents and that the asserted claims of the patents are
invalid.  The Company also believes that subsequent to the merger with Conner,
the Company's earlier paid-up license under Papst's patents extinguishes any
ongoing liability.  The Company also believes it enjoys the benefit of a license
under Papst's patents since Papst Licensing had granted a license to motor
vendors of Conner.

In the normal course of business, the Company receives and makes inquiry with
regard to other possible intellectual property matters including alleged patent
infringement.  Where deemed advisable, the Company may seek or extend licenses
or negotiate settlements.

Other Matters
- -------------

The Company is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business.  Although occasional adverse decisions
(or settlements) may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of
such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.
