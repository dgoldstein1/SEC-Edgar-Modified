              NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (Unaudited)



1.   Basis of Presentation
     ---------------------

     The consolidated condensed financial statements have been prepared by the
     Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
     Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information and footnote
     disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
     accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
     condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.  The Company
     believes the disclosures included in the unaudited consolidated condensed
     financial statements, when read in conjunction with the consolidated
     financial statements of the Company as of July 3, 1998 and notes thereto,
     are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

     The consolidated condensed financial statements reflect, in the opinion of
     management, all material adjustments necessary to summarize fairly the
     consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for
     such periods.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.

     The results of operations for the three and six month periods ended January
     1, 1999 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
     for the entire year ending July 2, 1999.

     The Company operates and reports financial results on a fiscal year of 52
     or 53 weeks ending on the Friday closest to June 30.  Accordingly, fiscal
     1998 was 53 weeks and ended on July 3, 1998 and fiscal 1999 will be 52
     weeks and will end on July 2, 1999.



2.   Net Income (Loss) Per Share
     ---------------------------

     For the periods in which the Company had net income, basic net income per
     share was based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
     outstanding during the period.  For the same periods diluted net income per
     share further included the effect of dilutive stock options outstanding
     during the period.  For the periods in which the Company had a net loss,
     the net loss per share was computed using only the weighted average number
     of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  The following
     table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per
     share.

     computation because the effect would be antidilutive.

4.   Income Taxes
     ------------

     The effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for
     the six months ended January 1, 1999 was 40% compared with a 21% effective
     tax rate used to record the benefit from income taxes for the comparable
     period last year. The higher effective tax rate used to record the
     provision for income taxes for the six months ended January 1, 1999
     resulted primarily from additional non-deductible charges associated with
     the acquisition of Quinta Corporation.  Excluding the non-deductible
     charges from the Quinta Corporation acquisition, the pro forma effective
     tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for the six months
     ended January 1, 1999 would have been 28%.  The pro forma effective tax
     rate of 28% is less than the U.S. statutory rate because a portion of the
     Company's anticipated foreign operating income is not subject to foreign
     income taxes and is considered to be permanently reinvested in non-U.S.
     operations.

6.   Restructuring Costs
     -------------------

     In the quarters ended January 2, 1998 and April 3, 1998, the Company
     recorded restructuring charges aggregating $347 million.  These charges
     reflect steps the Company is taking to align worldwide operations with
     current market conditions by reducing existing capacity in all areas of the
     Company and improving the productivity of its operations and the efficiency
     of its development efforts by consolidating manufacturing and R&D
     operations.  Actions include exiting production of mobile products; early
     discontinuation of several other products; closing and selling the Clonmel,
     Ireland drive manufacturing facility; closing and subleasing the San Jose
     and Moorpark, CA design center facilities; aborting production expansion
     projects in Medan, Indonesia and Cork, Ireland; and divesting the Company
     of the new Philippines manufacturing facility, which was nearing
     completion.  The restructuring charges comprised $57 million for reduction
     of personnel due to closure or consolidation of certain operations, $78
     million for closure of excess facilities, $137 million to write off or
     write down equipment whose value had become permanently impaired, $11
     million to write off or write down intangibles and other assets whose value
     had become permanently impaired, $43 million for contract cancellations,
     and $21 million for other expenses.



     As of January 1, 1999, the Company's planned workforce reduction of
     approximately 15,000 employees had been completed. The Company anticipates
     that the remaining implementation of the restructuring plan will be
     substantially complete as of July 2, 1999.  The following table summarizes
     the Company's restructuring activity for the six months ended January 1,
     1999:

7.   Acquisition of Quinta
     ---------------------

     In April and June 1997, the Company invested an aggregate of $20 million to
     acquire approximately ten percent (10%) of the outstanding stock of Quinta,
     a developer of ultra-high capacity disc drive technologies, including a new
     optically-assisted Winchester (OAW) technology. In August 1997, the Company
     completed the acquisition of Quinta.  Pursuant to the purchase agreement
     with Quinta, the shareholders of Quinta, other than Seagate, received cash
     payments aggregating $230 million upon closing of the acquisition and were
     eligible to receive additional cash payments aggregating $96 million upon
     the achievement of certain product development and early production
     milestones.  Of the $96 million, $19 million was paid or accrued in fiscal
     1998.  In July 1998, the Company and Quinta amended the purchase agreement
     to eliminate the product development and early production milestones, and
     provide that the former shareholders 

                                       9
<PAGE>
 
     of Quinta will be eligible to receive the remaining $77 million and the $14
     million that had been accrued but unpaid in fiscal 1998 in equal
     installments beginning September 30, 1998 and ending March 31, 2000. In the
     quarter ended October 2, 1998, the Company recorded a charge to operations
     for the remaining $77 million.


8.   Foreign Currency Derivatives
     ----------------------------

     The Company may enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option
     contracts to manage exposure related to certain foreign currency
     commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated expenditures
     primarily in Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia.  The goal of the Company's
     hedging program is to economically guarantee or lock in the exchange rates
     on a portion of the Company's local currency cash flows and not to
     eliminate all short-term earnings volatility.  Because not all economic
     hedges qualify as accounting hedges, unrealized gains and losses may be
     recognized in advance of the actual foreign currency cash flows.  This
     mismatch of accounting gains and losses and foreign currency cash flows was
     especially pronounced for the first and second quarters of fiscal 1998 as a
     result of the declines in the value of the Thai baht and Malaysian ringgit
     relative to the U.S. dollar.  Accordingly, the Company's results for the
     six months ended January 2, 1998 include other expenses of approximately
     $76 million for unrealized losses on foreign currency forward exchange
     contracts.  Based on uncertainty in the Southeast Asian foreign currency
     markets, the Company has temporarily suspended purchasing foreign currency
     forward exchange and option contracts for the Thai baht, Malaysian ringgit
     and Singapore dollar.



9.   Comprehensive Income
     --------------------

     As of July 4, 1998 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
     Standards No. 130 ("SFAS 130"), Reporting Comprehensive Income.  SFAS 130
     establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income
     and its components; however, the adoption of SFAS 130 had no impact on the
     Company's net income or stockholders' equity.  SFAS 130 requires unrealized
     gains or losses on the Company's available-for-sale securities and foreign
     currency translation adjustments, which prior to adoption were reported
     separately in stockholders' equity to be included in other comprehensive
     income.  The components of comprehensive income, net of related tax, for
     the six months ended January 1, 1999 and January 2, 1998 were as follows

10.  Veritas Transaction
     -------------------

     The Company, its majority-owned subsidiary, Seagate Software, Inc. ("SSI")
     and SSI's Network & Storage Management Group, Inc. ("NSMG") subsidiary
     announced on October 5, 1998 that they had entered into an Agreement and
     Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") as of such date with Veritas Holding
     Corporation ("New Veritas") and Veritas Software Corporation ("Veritas").
     Veritas provides end-to-end storage management software solutions.

     The Plan provides for the contribution by the Company, SSI and certain of
     their respective subsidiaries to New Veritas of (a) the outstanding stock
     of NSMG and certain other subsidiaries of SSI, and (b) those assets used
     primarily in the network storage management business of SSI (the "NSMG
     Business"), in consideration for the issuance of shares of Common Stock of
     New Veritas to SSI and the offer by New Veritas to grant options to
     purchase Common Stock of New Veritas to certain of SSI's employees who
     become employees of New Veritas or its subsidiaries. As part of the Plan,
     New Veritas will also assume certain liabilities of the NSMG Business.  The
     Plan is structured to qualify as a tax-free exchange. The merger will be
     accounted for as a non-monetary transaction using the fair value of the
     assets exchanged.

     Upon consummation of the merger, New Veritas shall issue shares of Common
     Stock to SSI equal to approximately 40% of the fully diluted Common Stock
     equivalent equity interests in New Veritas (assuming conversion of all
     convertible securities, including the Veritas convertible debentures, and
     exercise of all assumed options and warrants) less that number of shares of
     New Veritas Common Stock issuable upon exercise of New Veritas options
     issued to the SSI employees who surrender their outstanding options to
     purchase shares of SSI's Common Stock.  Upon consummation of the merger,
     the former security holders of Veritas will be issued New Veritas
     securities representing approximately 60% of the fully diluted Common Stock
     equivalent equity interests in New Veritas.

     The merger is subject to a number of conditions, including but not limited
     to the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 filed by New
     Veritas with the Securities and Exchange Commission, approval by the
     stockholders of Veritas and SSI, the expiration or termination of the
     waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
     Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary closing
     conditions.

     SSI anticipates recording a substantial gain and certain expenses in
     connection with the merger.  The gain will be recorded in fiscal 1999.  The
     expenses will include a 

                                       11
<PAGE>
 
     one-time write-off of in-process research and development during fiscal
     1999 as well as amortization of goodwill and intangibles over four years
     following the merger. The magnitude of the gain and expenses will depend on
     several factors, including the average stock price of Veritas around the
     date of the merger, the number of shares of stock exchanged and the value
     of Veritas' business. SSI will account for its investment in Veritas using
     the equity method. It now appears that the merger, which had been expected
     to be consummated in the third quarter of fiscal 1999, will not be
     consummated until early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.

     Historically, NSMG has had higher gross margins as a percent of sales than
     the Company.  Therefore, if the exchange with Veritas is consummated, it
     could result in lower gross margins for the Company.  The Company's gross
     margins for the six months ended January 1, 1999 and the year ended July 3,
     1998 were 22.3% and 14.5% respectively. Without NSMG, such gross margins
     would have been 20.0% and 12.6% respectively. However, under the equity
     method of accounting, the Company will record its equity interest in the
     net income or loss of Veritas each quarter. This equity income or loss will
     be classified as non-operating income (loss) on the Company's income
     statement.

Certain Forward-Looking Information:
- ------------------------------------

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements include the statements
relating to the effective tax rate in the eighth paragraph under "Results of
Operations," the statements relating to the merger between Veritas and NSMG
beginning in the ninth paragraph under "Results of Operations," the statements
regarding capital expenditures in the third paragraph under "Liquidity and
Capital Resources," the statements below under "Factors Affecting Future
Operating Results" and the statements under "Part II Other Information - Item 1.
Legal Proceedings," among others.  These forward-looking statements are based on
current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. Such risks and uncertainties are set forth below under "Factors
Affecting Future Operating Results."


Results of Operations:
- ----------------------

Revenue for the quarter ended January 1, 1999 was $1.801 billion, as compared
with $1.673 billion for the comparable year-ago quarter, and $1.553 billion for
the immediately preceding quarter ended October 2, 1998. The increase in revenue
from the comparable year-ago quarter was due primarily to a higher level of unit
shipments with an improved mix of the Company's products partially offset by a
continuing decline in the average unit sales prices of the Company's products as
a result of intensely competitive market conditions.  Volume accounted for $1.4
billion of the revenue increase offset by $1.3 billion of price erosion.  The
increase in revenue from the immediately preceding quarter was due primarily to
a higher level of unit shipments with an improved mix of the Company's products
partially offset by a continuing decline in the average unit sales prices of the
Company's products.  Volume accounted for $0.3 billion of the revenue increase
partially offset by $0.1 billion in price erosion.  Revenue for the six months
ended January 1, 1999 was $3.354 billion as compared with $3.569 for the
comparable year-ago period.  Price erosion accounted for $2.3 billion of the
revenue decline partially offset by $2.1 billion due to improved volume and
product mix.  The Company expects that price erosion in the data storage
industry will continue for the foreseeable future.  This competition and
continuing price erosion could adversely affect the Company's results of
operations in any given quarter and such adverse effect often cannot be
anticipated until late in any given quarter.

Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 23.8% and 22.3% for the three and
six months ended January 1, 1999, compared with 11.4% and 13.6% for the
comparable year-ago periods and 20.7% for the immediately preceding quarter
ended October 2, 1998.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue
from both year-ago periods was primarily due to cost savings as a result of the
Company's restructuring activities and an intensive program of cost reduction.
Cost reductions included reduced scrap and rework as well as reductions in other
manufacturing costs.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue
from the immediately preceding quarter was primarily due to higher consolidated
revenue and lower manufacturing costs as a result of the Company's intensive
cost reduction program.

                                       13

Product development expenses for the three and six months ended January 1, 1999
were $156 million and $297 million, respectively, an increase of $12 million and
$9 million when compared with the comparable year-ago periods and an increase of
$15 million when compared with the immediately preceding quarter ended October
2, 1998.  These expenses represented 8.7% and 8.9%, respectively, of revenue for
the three and six months ended January 1, 1999 compared with 8.6% and 8.1%,
respectively, for the comparable year-ago periods and 9.1% of revenue for the
immediately preceding quarter. The increase in expenses from the comparable 
year-ago quarter was primarily due to increases of $9 million in accruals for
profit sharing and management bonuses and $6 million in salaries and related
costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $8 million in
allocated occupancy costs. The increase in expenses from the comparable year-ago
six month period was primarily due to increases of $8 million in salaries and
related costs, $6 million in accruals for profit sharing and management bonuses,
$6 million in depreciation, and $3 million in product development expenses
relating to the Company's software products and services. These increases were
partially offset by a decrease of $18 million in allocated occupancy costs. The
increase in expenses from the immediately preceding quarter was primarily due to
increases of $7 million in accruals for profit sharing and management bonuses
and $4 million in salaries and related costs.

Marketing and administrative expenses for the three and six months ended January
1, 1999 were $135 million and $266 million, respectively, an increase of $6
million and $11 million when compared with the comparable year-ago periods and
an increase of $4 million when compared with the immediately preceding quarter
ended October 2, 1998. These expenses represented 7.5% and 7.9%, respectively,
of revenue for the three and six months ended January 1, 1999 compared with 7.7%
and 7.1% for the comparable year-ago periods and 8.4% for the immediately
preceding quarter. The increase in expenses from the comparable year-ago quarter
was primarily due to increases of $6 million in marketing and administrative
expenses related to the Company's software products and services, $3 million in
accruals for employee profit sharing and management bonuses, $2 million in
salaries and related costs, and $1 million in recruitment and relocation
expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $9 million decrease in
allocated occupancy costs. The increase in expenses from the comparable year-ago
six month period was primarily due to increases of $13 million in marketing and
administrative expenses related to the Company's software products and services,
$4 million in accruals for profit sharing and management bonuses and $3 million
in salaries and related costs. These increases were partially offset by a
decrease of $12 million in allocated occupancy costs. The increase in expenses
from the immediately preceding quarter was primarily due to increases of $3
million in marketing and administrative expenses related to the Company's
software products and services, and $2 million in advertising and promotion
expenses.

Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles for the three and six months
ended January 1, 1999 was $11 million and $20 million, respectively, a decrease
of $1 million and $2 million when compared with the comparable year-ago periods.
The decrease in amortization from the comparable year-ago periods was primarily
due to the inclusion in amortization expense of the write-downs of goodwill and
the write-offs and write-downs, in the quarter ended January 2, 1998, of certain
intangible assets related to past acquisitions of software companies whose value
had become permanently impaired.

The $77 million charge to unusual items in the quarter ended October 2, 1998 was
in connection with an amendment to the purchase agreement for the August 1997
acquisition of Quinta.  See Note 7 to the consolidated condensed financial
statements.

Net other income increased by $25 million and $92 million, respectively, for the
three and six months ended January 1, 1999 when compared with the comparable
year-ago periods and increased by $3 million from the immediately preceding
quarter ended October 2, 1998.  The increase in net other income from the
comparable year-ago quarter was primarily due to $13 million of expenses related
to mark-to-market adjustments, in the quarter ended January 2, 1998 on certain
of the Company's foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the Thai baht
and the Malaysian ringgit, an increase of $3 million in interest income
primarily due to higher average invested cash, a decrease of $3 million in the
charge for minority interest as a result of lower income in the Company's
majority-owned subsidiary in Shenzhen, China, and a gain of $2 million on sales
of the Company's investment in Overland Data, Inc.  The increase in net other
income from the comparable year-ago six month period was primarily due to $76
million of expenses related to mark-to-market adjustments, in the period ended
January 2, 1998, on certain of the Company's foreign currency forward exchange
contracts for the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit, and a decrease of $6
million in the charge for minority interest as a result of lower income in the
Company's majority-owned subsidiary in Shenzhen, China.

The effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for the six
months ended January 1, 1999 was 40% compared with a 21% effective tax rate used
to record the benefit from income taxes for the comparable period last year. The
higher effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes for the
six months ended January 1, 1999 resulted primarily from additional non-
deductible charges associated with the acquisition of Quinta Corporation.
Excluding the non-deductible charges from the Quinta Corporation acquisition,
the pro forma effective tax rate used to record the provision for income taxes
for the six months ended January 1, 1999 would have been 28%.  The pro forma
effective tax rate of 28% is less than the U.S. statutory rate because a portion
of the Company's anticipated foreign operating income is not subject to foreign
income taxes and is considered to be permanently reinvested in non-U.S.
operations. While the Company expects its effective tax rate on operating income
for the remaining quarters of fiscal 1999 to approximate 28%, the actual
effective tax rate is expected to differ from this rate due to the impending
sale of Seagate Software's Network & Storage Management Group, Inc., and certain
additional costs the Company may incur in connection with future acquisitions.

The Company, its majority-owned subsidiary, Seagate Software, Inc. ("SSI") and
SSI's Network & Storage Management Group, Inc. ("NSMG") subsidiary announced on
October 5, 1998 that they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") as of such date with Veritas Holding Corporation
("New Veritas") and Veritas Software Corporation ("Veritas").  Veritas provides
end-to-end storage management software solutions.  The Plan provides for the
contribution by the Company, SSI and certain of their respective subsidiaries to
New Veritas of (a) the outstanding stock of NSMG and certain other subsidiaries
of SSI, and (b) those assets used primarily in the network storage management
business of SSI (the "NSMG Business"), in consideration for the issuance of
shares of Common Stock of New Veritas to SSI and the offer by New Veritas to
grant options to purchase Common Stock of New Veritas to certain of SSI's
employees who become employees of New Veritas or its subsidiaries. As part of
the Plan, New Veritas will also assume certain liabilities of the NSMG Business.
The Plan is structured to qualify as a tax-free exchange. The merger will be
accounted for as a non-monetary transaction using the fair value of the assets
exchanged.  Upon consummation of the merger, New Veritas shall issue shares of
Common Stock to SSI equal to approximately 40% of the fully diluted Common Stock
equivalent equity interests in New Veritas (assuming conversion of all
convertible securities, including the Veritas convertible debentures, and
exercise of all assumed options and warrants) less that number of shares of New
Veritas Common Stock issuable upon exercise of New Veritas options issued to the
SSI employees who surrender their outstanding 

                                       15
<PAGE>
 
options to purchase shares of SSI's Common Stock. Upon consummation of the
merger, the former security holders of Veritas will be issued New Veritas
securities representing approximately 60% of the fully diluted Common Stock
equivalent equity interests in New Veritas. The merger is subject to a number of
conditions, including but not limited to the effectiveness of a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 filed by New Veritas with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, approval by the stockholders of Veritas and SSI, the expiration or
termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary
closing conditions. SSI anticipates recording a substantial gain and certain
expenses in connection with the merger. The gain will be recorded in fiscal
1999. The expenses will include a one-time write-off of in-process research and
development during fiscal 1999 as well as amortization of goodwill and
intangibles over four years following the merger. The magnitude of the gain and
expenses will depend on several factors, including the average stock price of
Veritas around the date of the merger, the number of shares of stock exchanged
and the value of Veritas' business. SSI will account for its investment in
Veritas using the equity method. It now appears that the merger, which had been
expected to be consummated in the third quarter of fiscal 1999, will not be
consummated until early in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.

Historically, NSMG has had higher gross margins as a percent of sales than the
Company. Therefore, if the exchange with Veritas is consummated, it could result
in lower gross margins for the Company. The Company's gross margins for the six
months ended January 1, 1999 and the year ended July 3, 1998 were 22.3% and
14.5% respectively. Without NSMG, such gross margins would have been 20.0% and
12.6% respectively. However, under the equity method of accounting, the Company
will record its equity interest in the net income or loss of Veritas each
quarter. This equity income or loss will be classified as non-operating income
(loss) on the Company's income statement.

We have accounted for several of our past acquisitions, including the 
write-off of in-process research and development activities, in accordance 
with established accounting practices and based upon expert third-party 
valuations. For example, in the most recently completed fiscal year, 1998, we 
took a $214 million charge related to the write-off of in-process research and
development in connection with our acquisition of Quinta Corporation. After 
the fiscal years in which these transactions occurred, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission ("SEC") provided additional guidance on the determination 
of in-process research and development write-offs in a letter dated October 9,
1998 to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In connection 
with filings with the SEC regarding the contribution of the Network & Storage 
Management Group business to New Veritas and related transactions, the staff 
of the SEC commented upon the application of such additional guidance with 
respect to our historical financial statements. Until the SEC completes its 
review and its comments have been resolved, any impact from the application of
the additional guidance can not be quantified.

The Company is discontinuing the manufacture of microchips used in its disc
drive products and therefore is seeking a buyer for its Seagate Microelectronics
Limited subsidiary in Livingston, Scotland.  The Company will be required to
take a charge to operations related to this facility in its fiscal quarter
ending April 2, 1999.

The Company is discontinuing the manufacture of the suspensions used in the
production of recording heads. Given that decision, and pending the outcome of
the Company's plan to sell the assets related to the manufacture of those
suspensions,the Company may be required to take a charge to operations 
in its fiscal quarter ending April 2, 1999.

The Company is restructuring its customer service operations resulting in a 
reduction of these activities in Singapore.  The Company is evaluating the 
financial impact associated with this restructuring and may be required to take
a charge to operations in its fiscal quarter ending April 2, 1999.

Liquidity and Capital Resources:
- --------------------------------

At January 1, 1999, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments totaled $2.217 billion, an increase of $390 million from the July 3,
1998 balance.  This increase was primarily a result of net cash provided by
operating activities, partially offset by expenditures for property, equipment
and leasehold improvements, and the repurchase of approximately 3.3 million
shares of the Company's common stock for $101 million.  Until required for other
purposes, the Company's cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly
liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of
purchase.  The Company's short-term investments primarily consist of readily
marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of more than 90 days at the
time of purchase.

As of January 1, 1999, the Company had committed lines of credit of $82 million
that can be used for standby letters of credit and bankers' guarantees.  At
January 1, 1999, $67 million of these lines of credit were utilized.

The Company expects investments in property and equipment in the current fiscal
year to approximate $700 million, of which approximately $294 million had been
incurred as of January 1, 1999.  The Company plans to finance these investments
from existing cash balances and cash flows from operations.  The $294 million
year-to-date investment comprised $125 million for manufacturing facilities and
equipment for the recording head operations in the United States, 

                                       16
<PAGE>
 
Northern Ireland and Malaysia; $123 million for manufacturing facilities and
equipment related to the Company's subassembly and disc drive final assembly and
test facilities in the United States, Far East and the United Kingdom; $25
million for expansion of the Company's thin-film media operations in California,
Singapore, Northern Ireland and Mexico; and $21 million for other purposes.

During the six months ended January 1, 1999, the Company acquired approximately
3.3 million shares of its common stock for approximately $101 million.  The
repurchase of these shares was primarily in connection with a stock repurchase
program announced in June 1997 in which up to $600 million worth of the
Company's stock was authorized to be acquired in the open market. On February 
12, 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an increase to the stock 
repurchase program pursuant to which up to an additional $500 million may be 
expended to purchase shares of its common stock in the open market. As of 
February 15, 1999, the Company had repurchased nearly 15.3 million shares of its
common stock for nearly $514 million under the existing authorization, including
over 12 million shares purchased during its current fiscal year for a total 
consideration of nearly $426 million.

Factors Affecting Future Operating Results
- ------------------------------------------

We compete in the data storage industry, and there are a number of factors that,
in the past, have affected all of the companies in our industry, including us.
Many of these factors may also impact our business in the future.


Slowdown in Demand for Computer Systems May Cause a Decline in Demand for
Seagate Technology's Products

Our products are components in computer systems.  The demand for computer
systems has been volatile in the past and often has had an exaggerated effect on
the demand for our disc drive and tape drive products, in any given period.  In
the past, unexpected slowdowns in demand for computer systems have generally
caused sharp declines in demand for disc drives and tape drive products.  We
expect that this situation will occur again in the future and that demand for
our disc drive and tape drive products may be reduced.

In our industry, the supply of drives periodically exceeds demand.  When this
happens, the over supply of available products causes us to have higher than
anticipated inventory levels and we experience intense price competition from
other disc drive and/or tape drive manufacturers.


Seagate Technology's Financial Results Will Vary

We often experience a high volume of sales at the end of the quarter, so we may
not be able to determine that our fixed costs are too high relative to sales
until late in any given quarter.  Since this happens late in the quarter, we do
not have enough time to reduce these costs.  As a result, we would not be as
profitable or may even incur a loss.  In addition, our operating results have
been and may in the future be subject to significant quarterly fluctuations as a
result of a number of other factors including:

 .    the timing of orders from and shipment of products to major customers, such
     as Compaq.
 .    our product mix, with respect to higher margin, more recently introduced
     disc drive products versus older, lower margin disc drive products,
 .    accelerated reduction in the price of our disc drive products due to an
     oversupply of disc drives in the world market,
 .    manufacturing delays or interruptions, particularly at our major
     manufacturing facilities in Malaysia, Thailand, China and Singapore,
 .    acceptance by customers of competing technologies in lieu of our
     products,

                                       17
<PAGE>
 
 .    variations in the cost of components for our products,
 .    limited access to components that we obtain from a single or a limited
     number of suppliers,
 .    our inability to reduce our fixed costs to match revenues in any quarter
     because of our vertical manufacturing strategy,
 .    the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the cost of
     our products and the effective price of such products to foreign consumers,
     and
 .    competition and consolidation in the data storage industry.

For example, our revenue decreased to $3.354 billion in the first six months of
fiscal 1999 from $3.569 billion in the first six months of fiscal 1998 as a
result of increased competition that resulted in significant price decreases.
This decrease in revenue was partially offset by improved volume and product
mix.  In addition, our future operating results may also be adversely affected,
if we receive an adverse judgment or settlement in any of the legal proceedings
to which we are a party.


Seagate Technology Faces Intense Competition and May Not Be Able to Compete
Effectively

Even during periods when demand is stable, the data storage industry is
intensely competitive and vendors experience price erosion over the life of a
product.  We expect that our competitors will offer new and existing products at
lower prices if necessary to gain or retain market share and customers. We also
expect that price erosion in our industry will continue for the foreseeable
future.  Because we may need to reduce our prices to retain our market share,
the competition could adversely affect our results of operations in any given
quarter.  We have experienced and expect to continue to experience intense
competition from a number of domestic and foreign companies including the other
leading independent disc drive manufacturers, as well as large integrated
multinational manufacturers such as:

 .      Fujitsu Limited,
 .      International Business Machines Corporation,
 .      NEC Corporation,
 .      Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., and
 .      Toshiba Corporation.

We also face indirect competition from present and potential customers,
including several of the computer manufacturers listed above, that continuously
evaluate whether to manufacture their own drives or purchase them from outside
sources. If our customers decide to manufacture their own drives, it could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

We also compete with manufacturers of products that use alternative data storage
and retrieval technologies.  Products based upon such alternative technologies,
including optical recording technology and semiconductor memory (flash memory,
SRAM and DRAM), may compete with our products.

We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future
competitors.  If we fail to compete successfully, our business, operating
results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

                                       18

Seagate Technology May Not Develop Products in Time to Meet Changing
Technologies

Our customers have demanded new generations of drive products as advances in
other hardware components and software have created the need for improved
storage products with features such as increased storage capacity or improved
performance and reliability. As a result, the life cycles of our products
have been shortened, and we have been required to constantly develop and
introduce new cost-effective drive products within time to market windows that
become progressively shorter. We had research and development expenses of $420
million, $459 million and $585 million in fiscal 1996, 1997 and 1998,
respectively.

When we develop new disc and tape drive products with higher capacity and more
advanced technology, our operating results may decline because the increased
difficulty and complexity associated with producing such disc drives increases
the likelihood of reliability, quality or operability problems.  If our products
suffer increases in failures, are of low quality or are not reliable, customers
may reduce their purchases of our products and our manufacturing rework and
scrap costs and service and warranty costs may increase.  In addition, a decline
in the reliability of our products may make us less competitive as compared with
other disc and tape drive manufacturers.

Our products are used in combination with other hardware, such as
microprocessors, and other software.  Seagate Technology's future success will
also require strong demand by consumers and businesses for computer systems,
storage upgrades to computer systems and multimedia applications, such as
digital video and video-on-demand.   If delivery of our products is delayed, our
original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") customers may use our competitors'
products in order to meet their production requirements.  In addition, if
delivery of those OEMs' computer systems into which our products are integrated
is delayed, consumers and businesses may purchase comparable products from the
OEMs' competitors.  The consumers and businesses may wait to make their
purchases if they want to buy a product that has been announced but not yet
released, thus we would not be able to sell our existing inventory of products.
If customers hold back in anticipation of a new product, or buy from a
competitor instead, our operating results may be significantly adversely
impacted.

Consumers have shown that they want to purchase personal computers costing less
than $1,000.  We are developing low cost disc drives to meet the demand for disc
drives that are components of low cost personal computers.  However, we may not
be able to produce disc drives that meet our quality and performance standards
at a cost low enough to yield gross margins at acceptable levels to sustain the
development efforts.

Seagate Technology discontinued production of disc drives that use media smaller
than 3.5 inches, in January 1998.  We are continuing research and development of
smaller drives, because we believe that to compete successfully to supply
components for mobile, laptop, notebook and ultraportable computers, we must
supply a smaller product.  We intend to re-enter this market with a durable, low
power application in the future, although there can be no assurance that we will
be able to do so successfully.


Seagate Technology's Vertical Integration Strategy Entails a High Level of Fixed
Costs

The cost, quality and availability of certain components, including heads,
media, application specific integrated circuits, motors, printed circuit boards
and custom semiconductors are critical to the successful production of disc
drives.  Our strategy of vertical integration has allowed us to 

                                       19
<PAGE>
 
internally manufacture many of the critical components used in our products. We
have pursued a strategy of vertical integration of our manufacturing processes
in order to reduce costs, control quality and assure availability and quality of
certain components.

Seagate Technology's vertical integration strategy entails a high level of fixed
costs and requires a high volume of production and sales to be successful.
During periods of decreased production, such as we are now experiencing, these
high fixed costs have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse
effect on our operating results and financial condition.  In addition, a
strategy of vertical integration has in the past and could continue to delay our
ability to introduce products containing market-leading technology, because we
may not have developed the technology in house and do not have access to
external sources of supply without incurring substantial costs.  For example,
over the past two years we have experienced delays in product launches due to
delays in production of certain components as a result of slower than
anticipated internal development and manufacturing scale-up of new designs.


Seagate Technology has Experienced Delays in the Introduction of Products due to
Supply of Components

Seagate Technology also relies on independent suppliers for certain components.
In the past we have experienced production delays when we were unable to obtain
sufficient quantities of certain components.  Any prolonged interruption or
reduction in the supply of any key components could have a material adverse
effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  We rely on
single or limited source suppliers for certain components used in our products.
We may not be able to obtain components that meet our specifications and quality
standards at prices that enable us to earn a profit on the finished products.
For example, in the past Seagate Technology has experienced delays obtaining
head stack assemblies and certain integrated circuits for printed circuit board
assemblies due to lead time requirements or changes in specifications.  As a
result, certain of our suppliers substantially increased the price of such
components, and we have incurred increased costs for certain of these components
as a result of supply shortages. If we experience any extended interruption or
reduction in the supply of any key components, our business, results of
operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.


If Seagate Technology's Customers Delay or Cancel Orders, Seagate Technology's
Revenues will be Adversely Affected

The data storage industry has been characterized by large volume OEM purchase
agreements and large distributor orders. Typically, our OEM purchase agreements
permit the OEMs to cancel orders and reschedule delivery dates without
significant penalties. In the past, orders from many of our OEMs were cancelled
or delivery schedules were delayed as a result of changes in the requirements of
the OEM's customers. These order cancellations and delays in delivery schedules
have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the past, and
may again in the future. Our distributors and OEMs typically furnish us with
non-binding indications of their near-term requirements, with product deliveries
based on weekly confirmations. To the extent actual orders from distributors and
OEMs decrease from their non-binding forecasts, such variances could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

                                       20

Seagate Technology Faces Risks from Its International Operations

Seagate Technology has significant offshore operations including manufacturing
facilities, sales personnel and customer support operations.  We have
manufacturing facilities in Singapore, Thailand, the People's Republic of China,
Scotland, Northern Ireland, Malaysia, Indonesia and Mexico, in addition to those
in the United States. Our offshore operations are subject to certain inherent
risks including:

 .    fluctuations in currency exchange rates, such as the $76 million charge to
     income Seagate Technology incurred in fiscal 1998 from marking our hedge
     positions to market,
 .    longer payment cycles for sales in foreign countries,
 .    difficulties in staffing and managing international manufacturing
     operations,
 .    seasonal reductions in business activity in the summer months in Europe
     and certain other countries,
 .    increases in tariffs and duties, price controls, restrictions on foreign
     currencies and trade barriers imposed by foreign countries, and
 .    political unrest, particularly in areas in which we have manufacturing
     facilities.

These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition in the future.

Seagate Technology's products are priced in U.S. dollars even when sold to
customers who are located abroad.  The currency instability in the Asian and
other financial markets may make our products more expensive than products sold
by other manufacturers that are priced in one of the affected currencies.
Therefore, foreign customers may reduce purchases of our products.  We
anticipate that the recent turmoil in financial markets and the recent
deterioration of the underlying economic conditions in certain countries,
including those in Asia, may have an impact on our sales to customers located in
or whose end-user customers are located in those countries due to:

 .    the impact of currency fluctuations on the relative price of our products,
 .    restrictions on government spending imposed by the International Monetary
     Fund in those countries receiving the International Monetary Fund's
     assistance,
 .    customers' reduced access to working capital to fund purchases of disc
     drive components or software, such as our products due to:

     .  higher interest rates,
     .  reduced bank lending due to contractions in the money supply or  the
        deterioration in the customer's or its bank's financial condition, or
     .  the inability to access other financing


Seagate Technology Faces Risks from the Spin-off of Seagate Software's Network &
Storage Management Group

We consolidated our software businesses into a single entity called Seagate
Software in 1996.  Seagate Software's business consists of two primary
divisions, Network & Storage Management Group and Information Management Group.
We announced the Veritas transaction on October 5, 1998.  Seagate Technology's
Seagate Software subsidiary and Seagate Software employees who will become New
Veritas employees and who hold stock options in Seagate Software will 

                                       21
<PAGE>
 
receive approximately 40% of the fully diluted equity in New Veritas.

We face a number of risks prior to and after the closing of the Veritas
transaction including:

 .  our management personnel may be distracted from the day to day operations by
   the Veritas transaction,
 .  Information Management Group employees may be distracted by concerns about
   whether we will continue to operate that business or spin it off,
 .  Network & Storage Management Group customers may delay or cancel orders due
   to uncertainty about the spin-off,
 .  the ongoing OEM relationship with the Network & Storage Management Group and
   our tape drive operations may be disrupted,
 .  we have agreed not to compete in certain storage management software
   businesses for a specified period of time after the closing of the Veritas
   transaction and may not be able to benefit from future opportunities in
   that market,
 .  we will not have significant influence over the management of New Veritas,
   although initially we will have two representatives on its board of
   directors, and
 .  we will only be permitted to sell our interest in New Veritas in limited
   increments in compliance with certain SEC rules or to bear the expense of
   filing a registration statement.


Acquisition Related Accounting Charges Will Delay and Reduce Seagate
Technology's Profits

We intend to continue our expansion into complementary data technology
businesses through internal growth as well as acquisitions.  Acquisitions
involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the
operations and products of the acquired businesses and the potential loss of key
employees or customers of the acquired businesses.  We expect that the Company
will continue to incur substantial expenses as we acquire other businesses
including charges for the write-off of in-process research and development.  Our
operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future
because of the timing of such write-offs.  For example, we incurred a charge to
operations in the first quarter of fiscal 1998 of approximately $214 million for
the write-off of in-process research and development related to our acquisition
of Quinta Corporation. We anticipate a substantial charge to operations later in
fiscal 1999 for the write-off of in-process research and development related to
the contribution of the Network & Storage Management Group business to New
Veritas, and will experience ongoing charges related to the amortization of
purchased intangibles.


Systems Failures Could Adversely Affect Seagate Technology's Business

Seagate Technology's operations are dependent on our ability to protect our
computer equipment and the information stored in our databases from damage by
fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failures, unauthorized
intrusion and other catastrophic events.  We believe that we have taken prudent
measures to reduce the risk of interruption in our operations.  However, we
cannot be sure that these measures are sufficient.  Any damage or failure that
causes interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

                                       22

Seagate Technology May Experience Year 2000 Computer Problems That Harm Its
Business

The Year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs being written using two
digits rather than four to define the applicable year.  Computer programs that
have date-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900
rather than the year 2000.  Seagate Technology considers a product to be in
"Year 2000 compliance" if

 .    the product's performance and functionality are unaffected by processing of
     dates prior to, during and after the year 2000,  but only if
 .    all products (for example hardware, software and firmware) used with the
     product properly exchange accurate date data with it.

Seagate Technology's Products.  We are assessing the capability of our products
to determine whether or not they are in Year 2000 compliance.  Although we
believe our disc and tape drive products and certain of our software products
are in Year 2000 compliance, we have determined that certain software products
produced by Seagate Software, which are not material to Seagate Technology, are
not and will not be Year 2000 compliant.  We are taking measures to inform our
customers that those products are not and will not be Year 2000 compliant.  To
assist our customers in evaluating their Year 2000 issues, our Seagate Software
subsidiary has developed a list of those products that are Year 2000 compliant
as stand-alone products.  The list is located on Seagate Software's World Wide
Web page and is periodically updated when assessment of the Year 2000 compliance
of additional products is completed.  To date, the costs Seagate Technology has
incurred related to these programs have been immaterial.

However, the assessment of whether a complete system will operate correctly
depends on the BIOS capability and software design and integration, and for many
end-users this will include BIOS, software and components provided by companies
other than Seagate Technology or Seagate Software.  Seagate Technology considers
a disc drive or tape product to be Year 2000 capable if when used properly and
in conformity with the product information provided by us, our product will
accurately store, display, process, provide and/or receive data from, into and
between 1999 and 2000, including leap year calculations if all other technology
used in combination with the Seagate Technology disc drive or tape product
properly exchanges date data with the Seagate Technology product.

We are incurring various costs to provide customer support and customer
satisfaction services regarding Year 2000 issues and anticipate that these
expenditures will continue in fiscal 1999 and thereafter. In addition, we have
contacted our major customers to determine whether their products into which our
products have been and will be integrated are Year 2000 compliant. Seagate
Technology has received assurances of Year 2000 compliance from a number of
those customers.  Many other customers have not responded and are under no
contractual obligation to provide us with Year 2000 compliance information.
Seagate Technology is taking steps with respect to new customer agreements to
ensure that the customers' products and internal systems are Year 2000
compliant.

Even if our products are Year 2000 compliant, we may be named as a defendant in
litigation against the vendors of all of the component products of systems if
some components of the systems are unable to properly manage data related to the
Year 2000.  Our customer agreements typically contain provisions designed to
limit our liability for such claims.  It is possible, however, that these
measures will not provide protection from liability claims, as a result of
existing or future federal, state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable
judicial decisions.  If any such claims are brought against Seagate Technology,
regardless of their merit, our business, 

                                       23
<PAGE>
 
financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected from factors that include increased warranty costs, customer
satisfaction issues and the costs of potential lawsuits.

Seagate Technology's Systems.  We have also initiated a comprehensive program to
address Year 2000 readiness in our internal systems and with our customers and
suppliers.  Our program has been designed to address our most critical internal
systems first and to gather information regarding the Year 2000 compliance of
products supplied to Seagate Technology and into which our products are
integrated.  Seagate Technology conducted a Year 2000 inventory of information
technology systems in the first quarter of 1997.  Risk assessment was
substantially complete by the end of the second quarter of 1997, and remediation
activities continue to be on schedule.  Approximately 1,400 items were
identified, and as of January 1999, 118 items remain unresolved, with most
scheduled for completion by July 1999.  An initial inventory of non-information
technology systems was completed in the third quarter of 1997.  A second
inventory in the second and third quarters of 1998 included all manufacturing
operations with special emphasis on embedded technology and facilities.
Approximately 7,000 items were identified (non-information technology, and
embedded combined) of which approximately two-thirds are Year 2000 compliant.
As of January 1999, risk assessment is 95% complete and we believe that we will
resolve all non-compliant items by July 1999.

We are using the following phased approach to Year 2000 readiness: inventory,
assessment, disposition, test and audit.  Anticipated dates of completion of
each phase are as follows:
<TABLE>
<S>                                                                              <C>        
      1.  Inventory...........................................................   Complete
      2.  Assessment..........................................................   March 1, 1999
      3.  Disposition.........................................................   July 1, 1999
      4.  Test................................................................   July 1, 1999
      5.  Audit...............................................................   August 1, 1999
</TABLE>

These activities are intended to encompass all major categories of systems in
use by Seagate Technology, including manufacturing, engineering, sales, finance
and human resources.  To date, we have not incurred material costs related to
assessment and remediation of Year 2000 readiness.  We currently expect that the
total cost of our Year 2000 readiness programs, excluding redeployed resources,
will not exceed $10 million over the next fiscal year.  This total cost estimate
does not include potential costs related to any customer or other claims or the
costs of internal software or hardware replaced in the normal course of
business.  The total cost and time to completion estimates are based on the
current assessment of our Year 2000 readiness needs and are subject to change as
the projects proceed.

We are installing and testing new computer software for our financial,
accounting, inventory control, order processing and other management information
systems.  In the course of these upgrades we are identifying Year 2000
dependencies in such systems and are implementing changes to such systems to
make them Year 2000 compliant. The successful implementation of these new
systems is crucial to the efficient operation of our business.  We cannot
provide any assurance that we will implement our new systems in an efficient and
timely manner or that the new systems will be adequate to support our
operations. Problems with installation or initial operation of the new systems
could cause substantial management difficulties in operations planning,
financial reporting and management and thus could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We do not expect
the cost of bringing our systems into Year 2000 compliance to have a material
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

                                       24

Seagate Technology's material third party relationships include relationships
with suppliers, customers and financial institutions.  Seagate Technology has
identified 600 suppliers which are critical to our operations, and we have
surveyed each to provide details of their Year 2000 efforts, including internal
systems, operations and supply chain as well as a schedule for their projects.
As of January 1999, 97% of such suppliers have responded affirmatively and been
approved.  Efforts continue to validate the remaining suppliers, but plans will
be developed for any that fail validation, including alternate sources or
additional inventory for sole source suppliers.

Seagate Technology's largest customers were also surveyed regarding their Year
2000 efforts.  We currently do not anticipate any material impact due to a Year
2000-related failure of a major customer.  All of our financial institutions
have been surveyed.  All of our primary banking activities can be accommodated
by our two major multi-national banking partners with the exception of payroll
in certain Asian countries that must be handled in local currency.  We are
following Year 2000 progress in these areas closely and will develop specific
contingency plans for meeting payroll if we cannot obtain assurance that these
local banks are fully prepared.

Because Seagate Technology's core and mission-critical systems are either
complete or in the final stages of completion, we do not consider failure of
these systems to be within a reasonable Year 2000 worst case scenario.  We
believe we are primarily at risk due to failures within external infrastructures
such as utilities and transportation systems.  We are currently examining these
risk areas to develop responses and action plans.  These include a potential
business shutdown at all locations on December 30, 1999, and where feasible,
power down on December 31, 1999 with controlled startup prior to business
resumption on January 3, 2000.

While we currently expect that the Year 2000 issues will not pose significant
operational problems, we could experience material adverse effects on our
business if the implementation of new systems is delayed.  We could also
experience material adverse effects on our business if we fail to fully identify
all Year 2000 dependencies in our systems and in the systems of our suppliers,
customers and financial institutions.  Those material adverse effects could
include delays in the delivery or sale of Seagate Technology's products.
Therefore, we are developing contingency plans for continuing operations in the
event such problems arise.


Seagate Technology's Stock Price Will Fluctuate

Our stock price has varied greatly as has the volume of shares of our common
stock that are traded.  We expect these fluctuations to continue due to factors
such as:


 .  announcements of new products, services or technological innovations by us or
   our competitors
 .  announcements of major restructurings by us or our competitors
 .  quarterly variations in our results of operations
 .  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and
   speculation in the press or investment community
 .  general conditions in the data storage industry or the personal computer
   industry
 .  changes in our revenue growth rates or the growth rates of our competitors
 .  sales of large blocks of our stock


The stock market may from time to time experience extreme price and volume
fluctuations.  

                                       25
<PAGE>
 
Many technology companies have experienced such fluctuations. In addition, our
stock price may be affected by general market conditions and domestic and
international macroeconomic factors unrelated to our performance. Often such
fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific
companies. The market price of our common stock may experience significant
fluctuations in the future. For example, our stock price fluctuated from a high
of $45 3/4 to a low of $17 3/4 during fiscal year 1998.


Seagate Technology Faces Risks from the Conversion to a Single European Currency

On January 1, 1999, certain member states of the European Economic Community
fixed their respective currencies to a new currency, the Single European
Currency.  On that day the Single European Currency became a functional legal
currency within these countries.  During the three years beginning on January 1,
1999, business in these countries will be conducted both in the existing
national currency, such as the French Franc or the Deutsche Mark, as well as the
Single European Currency.  Companies operating in or conducting business in
these countries will need to ensure that their financial and other software
systems are capable of processing transactions and properly handling the
existing currencies and the Single European Currency.  We are still assessing
the impact that the introduction and use of the Single European Currency will
have on our internal systems.  We will take corrective actions based on such
assessment but do not presently expect that the introduction and use of the
Single European Currency will materially affect our foreign exchange and hedging
activities or use of derivative instruments or will result in any material
increase in our costs. While we will continue to evaluate the impact of the
Single European Currency introduction over time, based on currently available
information, we do not believe that the introduction of the Single European
Currency will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or
overall trends in results of operations, nor have the introduction and use of
the Single European Currency had such effects to date.

                               OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
         -----------------

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.  These statements relate to the Company's legal
proceedings described below.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and may result
in adverse rulings or decisions.  Additionally, the Company may enter into
settlements or be subject to judgments which may, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations.  Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements.

Patent Litigation
- -----------------

In November 1992, Rodime, PLC ("Rodime") filed a complaint in Federal Court for
the Central District of California, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. B1
4,638,383 and various state law unfair competition claims.  It was the opinion
of the Company's patent counsel that the Company's products do not infringe any
valid claims of the Rodime patent in suit and thus the Company refused Rodime's
offer of a license for its patents.  Other companies, however, such as IBM,
Hewlett-Packard and a number of Japanese companies have reportedly made payments
to and taken licenses from Rodime.  On October 24, 1997 the Court entered a
Final Judgment against Rodime and in favor of Seagate.  Rodime  appealed from
the final judgment, and arguments on appeal were heard by the Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit on September 3, 1998.  The Company intends to vigorously
defend itself in the appeal brought by Rodime.

On October 5, 1994, a patent infringement action was filed against the Company
by an individual, James M. White, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California for alleged infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 4,673,996
and 4,870,519.  Both patents relate to air bearing sliders.  Prior to the filing
of the lawsuit, the Company filed a Petition for Reexamination of U.S. Patent
No. 4,673,996 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") and
this Petition was granted shortly after the lawsuit was filed.  Subsequently,
the Company filed a Petition for Reexamination of U.S. Patent No. 4,870,519.
This second petition was also granted by the PTO.  The District Court stayed the
action pending the outcome of the Reexaminations.  Both patents have completed
reexamination and the stay of the action has been lifted.  Mr. White's lawyers
filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the sale of certain of
the Company's products.  The Court denied the motion on July 1, 1997.  On April
27, 1998, the Court entered an order establishing a construction of the claims
in Mr. White's patents which is broader than the construction which the company
advocated, and on June 25, 1998, the Court denied reconsideration of the April
27 order.  The Court set March 8, 1999 as the date for commencement of the
trial in this action. On February 12, 1999, the Company entered into a 
settlement agreement which should be implemented by dismissal of the lawsuit in 
the Company's current fiscal quarter ending April 2, 1999.


On December 16, 1996, a patent infringement action was filed against the Company
by an individual, Virgle Hedgcoth, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of California, San Jose Division, for alleged infringement of U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,735,840; 5,082,747; and 5,316,864.  These patents relate to
sputtered magnetic thin-film recording discs for computers and their
manufacture.  The Company answered the complaint denying infringement, alleging

                                       27
<PAGE>
 
that the patents are invalid and unenforceable, and counterclaiming for
declaratory judgment that a fourth Hedgcoth patent, No. 4,894,133, is invalid,
unenforceable and not infringed.  Additionally, on July 1, 1997, Mr. Hedgcoth
filed a patent infringement action against the Company in the same Court for
alleged infringement of a fifth patent, U.S. Patent No. 5,262,970, issued May 6,
1997.  Mr. Hedgcoth passed away on April 8, 1998, and the Court subsequently
substituted Susan Ann Alexander Hedgcoth as a party Plaintiff in place of Mr.
Hedgcoth.  On December 4, 1998, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
which should be implemented by dismissal of the lawsuit in early 1999.

Papst Licensing, GmbH, has given the Company notice that it believes certain
former Conner Peripherals, Inc. ("Conner") disc drives infringe several of its
patents covering the use of spindle motors in disc drives.  It is the opinion of
the Company's patent counsel that the former Conner disc drives do not infringe
any claims of the patents and that the asserted claims of the patents are
invalid.  The Company also believes that subsequent to the merger with Conner,
the Company's earlier paid-up license under Papst's patents extinguishes any
ongoing liability.  The Company also believes it enjoys the benefit of a license
under Papst's patents since Papst Licensing had granted a license to motor
vendors of Conner.

In the normal course of business, the Company receives and makes inquiry with
regard to other possible intellectual property matters including alleged patent
infringement.  Where deemed advisable, the Company may seek or extend licenses
or negotiate settlements.


Other Matters
- -------------

The Company is involved in a number of other judicial and administrative
proceedings incidental to its business.  Although occasional adverse decisions
(or settlements) may occur, the Company believes that the final disposition of
such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.
