ITEM 5:  OTHER EVENTS

         On May 28, 1999, Seagate Technology, and its direct and indirect
subsidiaries, Seagate Software and the Seagate Software Network & Storage
Management Group, closed and consummated the Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization (the "Plan") dated as of October 5, 1998 with VERITAS Holding
Corporation ("New VERITAS") and VERITAS Software Corporation ("VERITAS"). The
Plan provided for the contribution by Seagate Technology, Seagate Software, and
certain of their respective subsidiaries to New VERITAS of (a) the outstanding
stock of the Network & Storage Management Group and certain other subsidiaries
of Seagate Software and (b) those assets used primarily in the network and
storage management business of Seagate Software (the "NSMG business"), in
consideration for the issuance of shares of Common Stock of New VERITAS to
Seagate Software and the offer by New VERITAS to grant options to purchase
Common Stock of New VERITAS to certain of Seagate Software's employees who
become employees of New VERITAS or its subsidiaries. As part of the Plan, New
VERITAS assumed certain liabilities of the NSMG business. The Plan was
structured to qualify as a tax-free exchange.

         Subsequent to the consummation, all outstanding securities of New
VERITAS were assumed and converted into common stock of VERITAS with identical
rights, preferences and privileges, on a share for share basis. As a result of
the contribution of the NSMG business to New VERITAS, Seagate Software received
a total of 69,148,208 shares of VERITAS common stock and former employees of the
NSMG business received options to purchase an aggregate of 6,945,048 shares of
VERITAS common stock. Share and option amounts for VERITAS have been adjusted to
reflect the two-for-one stock split effective July 9, 1999 by VERITAS.

         In a separate but related transaction to the NSMG contribution to
VERITAS, on June 9, 1999, Seagate Technology exchanged 5,275,772 shares of its
common stock for 3,267,255 of the outstanding shares of Seagate Software common
stock owned by employees, directors, and consultants of Seagate Software. The
exchange ratio was determined based on the estimated value of Seagate Software
common stock divided by the fair market value of Seagate Technology common
stock.

         The pro forma financial information presented below is presented as if
the contribution of NSMG to VERITAS and the purchase of the Seagate Software
minority interest by Seagate Technology had occurred at the beginning of fiscal
1999. The pro forma statements of operations for the twelve months ended July 2,
1999, include the historical results of Seagate Technology less the historic
results of the NSMG business through the 11 months ended May 28, 1999, plus
Seagate Technology's equity interest in the pro forma results of VERITAS,
including recurring amortization of related goodwill and intangibles plus
recurring amortization of goodwill and intangibles associated with the purchase
of shares of Seagate Software stock by Seagate Technology.

              Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Financial Statements

1.   Pro Forma Basis of Presentation

         The pro forma financial information presented below is presented as if
the contribution of NSMG to VERITAS and the purchase of the Seagate Software
minority interest by Seagate Technology had occurred at the beginning of fiscal
1999. The pro forma statements of operations for the twelve months ended July 2,
1999, include the historical results of Seagate Technology less the historic
results of the NSMG business through 11 months ended May 28, 1999, plus Seagate
Technology's equity interest in the pro forma results of VERITAS, including
recurring amortization of related goodwill and intangibles plus recurring
amortization of goodwill and intangibles associated with the purchase of shares
of Seagate Software stock by Seagate Technology. The pro forma statement of
operations excludes the effect of non-recurring items relating to the Gain on
contribution of NSMG to VERITAS, net, the write-off of amounts pertaining to
in-process research and development and compensation expense.

         Seagate Technology will include in its financial results its share of
the net income or loss of VERITAS, excluding certain NSMG purchase accounting
related amounts recorded by VERITAS, but including Seagate Technology's
amortization of the difference between its recorded investment and the
underlying assets and liabilities of VERITAS. Because of practicality
considerations, the net income or loss of VERITAS will be included in the
results of Seagate Technology on a one quarter lag basis. The pro forma results
have been prepared consistent with a one quarter lag basis. Accordingly, the
results of VERITAS (including the results of NSMG) included in the pro forma
results for fiscal 1999 are the results for the period from April 1998 to March
1999.

         In a separate but related transaction to the NSMG contribution to
VERITAS, on June 9, 1999, Seagate Technology exchanged 5,275,772 shares of its
common stock for 3,267,155 of the outstanding shares of Seagate Software common
stock owned by employees, directors and consultants of Seagate Software. The
exchange ratio was determined based on the estimated value of Seagate Software
common stock divided by the fair market value of Seagate Technology common
stock.

         The estimated value of Seagate Software common stock exchanged into
Seagate Technology common stock was determined based upon the sum of the fair
value of the NSMG business, as measured by the fair value of the shares received
from VERITAS, plus the estimated fair value of the Information Management Group
("IMG") of Seagate Software as determined by the Seagate Software Board of
Directors and as approved by the Seagate Technology Board of Directors, plus the
assumed proceeds from the exercise of all outstanding Seagate Software stock
options, divided by the number of fully converted shares of Seagate Software.
The Boards of Directors of Seagate Software and Seagate Technology considered a
number of factors in assessing the estimated fair value of the IMG business,
including historical and projected revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as
other factors and consultations with financial advisors.

         The fair value of the Seagate Software shares acquired less the
original purchase price paid by the employees was recorded as compensation
expense for those shares outstanding and vested less than six months. The
purchase of Seagate Software shares outstanding and vested more than six months
was accounted for as the purchase of a minority interest and, accordingly, the
fair value of the shares exchanged has been allocated to all of the identifiable
tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Seagate

Software. In connection with the acquisition, Seagate Technology recorded
compensation expense amounting to approximately $123.8 million and wrote off
purchased research and development amounting to $2.4 million in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1999. Associated intangible assets and goodwill are being
amortized to operations over four years.

Method for allocating purchase price

     Tangible net assets of VERITAS principally include cash and investments,
accounts receivable, fixed assets and other current assets. Liabilities
principally include accounts payable, accrued compensation, and other accrued
liabilities.

     To estimate the value of the developed technology, the expected future cash
flows attributable to all existing technology was discounted, taking into
account risks related to the characteristics and applications of the technology,
existing and future markets, and assessments of the life cycle stage of the
technology. The developed technology is being amortized on the straight-line
basis over its estimated useful life (four years) which is expected to exceed
the ratio of current revenues to the total of current and anticipated revenues.

     The value of the distribution networks and original equipment manufacturer
agreements was estimated by considering, among other factors, the size of the
current and potential future customer bases, the quality of existing
relationships with customers, the historical costs to develop customer
relationships,

               Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Financial Statements

the expected income and associated risks. Associated risks included the inherent
difficulties and uncertainties in transitioning business relationships and risks
related to the viability of and potential changes to future target markets.

     The value of trademarks was estimated by considering, among other factors,
the assumption that in lieu of ownership of a trademark, a company would be
willing to pay a royalty in order to exploit the related benefits of such
trademark.

     The value of the assembled workforce was estimated as the costs to replace
the existing employees, including recruiting, hiring, and training costs for
each category of employee.

     The value allocated to projects identified as in-process technology at
VERITAS and Seagate Software, for the minority interest acquired, were charged
to expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. These write-offs were necessary
because the acquired technologies had not reached technological feasibility at
the date of purchase and have no future alternative uses. Seagate Software
expects that the acquired in-process research and development will be
successfully developed, but there can be no assurance that commercial viability
of these products will be achieved.

     The nature of the efforts required to develop the purchased in-process
technology into commercially viable products principally relate to the
completion of all planning, designing, prototyping, verification and testing
activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to
meet its design specifications, including functions, features and technical
performance requirements. The value of the purchased in-process technology for
VERITAS was estimated as the projected net cash flows related to such products,
including costs to complete the development of the technology and the future
revenues to be earned upon commercialization of the products, excluding revenues
attributable to future development efforts. These cash flows were then
discounted back to their net present value. The projected net cash flows from
such projects were based on management's estimates of revenues and operating
profits related to such projects.

     Goodwill is calculated as the residual difference between the estimated
amount paid and the values assigned to identified tangible and intangible assets
and liabilities.

           intangibles and goodwill resulting from to the NSMG contribution to
           VERITAS.

     (2)   To reflect Seagate Software's equity in the income of New VERITAS
           (including NSMG) prior to the effect of the amortization of
           intangible assets and including goodwill, associated with the NSMG
           transaction.

     (3)   To reflect the elimination of the step-up in basis of the investment
           in VERITAS.

     (4)   To reflect the elimination of the write-off of in-process research
           and development resulting from the NSMG contribution to VERITAS.
