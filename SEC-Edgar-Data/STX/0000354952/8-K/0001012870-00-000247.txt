             SEAGATE AND RODIME ENTER INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
             --------------------------------------------------


SCOTTS VALLEY, CA -- January 26, 2000 - Seagate Technology, Inc. (NYSE:SEG)
today announced that the Company has agreed to settle with Rodime PLC regarding
a patent infringement complaint relating to certain discontinued 3.5-inch drives
filed by Rodime against Seagate on November 18, 1992.  Pursuant to the
agreement, Seagate shall be released from all patent and tort claims in exchange
for a payment of $45 million.

Stephen Luczo, Seagate's president and CEO, stated "We maintain the position
that Seagate had meritorious defenses to Rodime's claim. However, given the
uncertainty associated with leaving such a technically complex matter in the
hands of a jury with no expertise in disc drive technology, Seagate has
compromised this claim to mitigate this uncertainty."

A charge associated with this settlement will be reflected in Seagate's Form 10-
Q for the quarter ended December 31, 1999.

                                     ###
