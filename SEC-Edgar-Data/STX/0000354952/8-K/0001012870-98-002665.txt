Item 5.    OTHER EVENTS.
           ------------ 

        Seagate Technology, Inc. ("STI"), its Seagate Software, Inc. ("SSI")
subsidiary and Seagate Software Network & Storage Management Group, Inc.
("NSMG"), a wholly owned subsidiary of SSI, announced on October 5, 1998 that
they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") as
of such date with Veritas Holding Corporation ("Newco") and Veritas Software
Corporation ("VERITAS"), which provides for (i) the contribution by SSI, STI
and certain of their respective subsidiaries to Newco of (a) the outstanding
stock of NSMG and certain other subsidiaries of SSI, and (b) those assets used
primarily in the network storage management business of SSI (the "NSMG
Business"), in consideration for the issuance of shares of Common Stock of
Newco to SSI and the offer by Newco to grant options to purchase Common Stock
of Newco to certain SSI employees who become employees of Newco or its
subsidiaries in exchange for cancellation by such employees of their
respective options to purchase Common Stock of SSI (the "Seagate Transaction")
and (ii) the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco with and into
VERITAS and the assumption and conversion of all outstanding VERITAS
securities, on a share for share basis, into Newco securities having identical
rights, preferences and privileges, including convertible debentures of
VERITAS which will become convertible into Common Stock of Newco on the same
basis as they are currently convertible into VERITAS Common Stock (the
"Veritas Merger"). As part of the Seagate Transaction, Newco will also assume
certain liabilities of the NSMG Business. The Seagate Transaction is
structured to qualify as a tax-free exchange and the Veritas Merger is
structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes. The Seagate Transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.

        Upon consummation of the Seagate Transaction, Newco shall issue a number
of shares of Common Stock to SSI equal to approximately 40% of the fully
diluted Common Stock equivalent equity interests in Newco (assuming conversion
of all convertible securities, including the VERITAS convertible debentures,
and exercise of all assumed options and warrants) less that number of shares
of Newco Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Newco options issued to SSI
employees in exchange for their outstanding options to purchase shares of SSI
Common Stock. Upon consummation of the Veritas Merger, the former security
holders of VERITAS will be issued Newco securities representing approximately
60% of the fully diluted Common Stock equivalent equity interests in Newco.

        The Veritas Merger and the Seagate Transaction are subject to a number
of conditions, including but not limited to the effectiveness of a Registration
Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Newco with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, approval by the stockholders of VERITAS and SSI, the expiration or
termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other customary
closing conditions.

        Certain affiliates of VERITAS, holding an aggregate of approximately
19% of the outstanding Common Stock of VERITAS, have entered into a Voting
Agreement with SSI agreeing to vote in favor of the Veritas Merger at any
meeting of the stockholders of VERITAS held for such purpose.

                                      -3-

        Contemporaneously with the execution of the Plan, STI entered into a
Development and License Agreement with   Newco and VERITAS (the "Development
Agreement") which will become effective upon the closing of the Plan.  The
Development Agreement provides for the grant to STI of a non-exclusive worldwide
license of VERITAS software products, including the software products of the
NSMG Business, for internal use, modification and preparation of derivative
works by STI and for distribution by STI to end-users and distributors, subject
to certain limitations and further provides for co-operative marketing efforts
by the parties.  STI will pay royalties to VERITAS with respect to the
distribution of such products.  The Development Agreement further provides for
the development by VERITAS of new products or technologies, additional features
or enhancements to the VERITAS software products requested by STI.  The initial
term of the Development Agreement will be ten years, with automatic renewal of
such agreement on an annual basis thereafter absent notice of termination from
either party.

        In addition, Seagate Software Information and Management Group, Inc.,
a subsidiary of SSI ("IMG") entered into a Cross-License and OEM Agreement (the
"Cross-License Agreement") with Newco and VERITAS that will become effective
upon the closing of the Plan and provides for the grant to IMG of a non-
exclusive worldwide license of VERITAS software products, including the NSMG
Business products, for internal use, modification and preparation of derivative
works by IMG and for distribution by IMG to end-users and distributors, subject
to certain limitations.  IMG will pay royalties to VERITAS with respect to the
distribution of certain of such products.  IMG will also license a restricted
version of IMG's Crystal Reports software product to VERITAS on a royalty-free
basis for distribution when bundled with, or incorporated into, a product of the
NSMG Business.  The Cross-License Agreement further provides for the development
by VERITAS of  new products or technologies, additional features or enhancements
to the VERITAS software products requested by IMG.  The initial term of the
Cross-License Agreement will be three years, with automatic renewal of such
agreement on an annual basis thereafter absent notice of termination from either
party.

        Upon closing of the Plan, it is anticipated that STI, SSI, VERITAS
and/or Newco will also enter into the following definitive agreements:

        (i)    Newco will enter into employment agreements with certain key
               employees of VERITAS and certain key SSI employees involved in
               the NSMG Business who have agreed to become employed by Newco;

        (ii)   SSI will enter into a registration rights agreement with Newco
               providing for certain registration rights of SSI with respect
               to the Newco Common Stock issued to SSI in the Seagate
               Transaction;

        (iii)  STI and SSI will enter into a stockholder agreement with Newco
               providing for (a) restrictions on the transfer of Newco Common
               Stock by SSI, (b) provisions relating to the purchase of
               additional shares of Newco Common Stock by SSI

               and STI, (c) restrictions on the voting rights of SSI and (d)
               nomination by STI of representatives to be elected to Newco's
               Board of Directors; and

        (iv)   STI and SSI will enter into a Transition Services and
               Facilities Use Agreement with Newco under which certain
               services will be provided to Newco with respect to the
               transition of the NSMG Business.

                    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (this "AGREEMENT") is entered
into as of October 5, 1998, by and among VERITAS Software Corporation, a
Delaware corporation including for all purposes VERITAS Surviving Corporation,
("VERITAS"), VERITAS Holding Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("NEWCO"),
Seagate Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("STI"), Seagate Software,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and majority owned subsidiary of STI ("SSI") and
Seagate Software Network & Storage Management Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SSI ("NSMG").  The terms defined in
Section 14.15 of this Agreement shall have the meanings therein specified in
this Agreement.

                                  RECITALS
                                  --------

     A.   The parties intend that, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, (i) a new Delaware corporation referred to herein as Newco has been
formed by VERITAS solely for the purpose of the transactions contemplated
hereunder; (ii) a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary of Newco ("MERGER SUB")
will be merged with and into VERITAS, with VERITAS being the surviving
corporation of such merger (the "MERGER"), and all outstanding VERITAS
securities will be converted, on a share for share basis, into Newco securities
having identical rights, preferences and privileges, with Newco assuming all
outstanding options, warrants, convertible debentures and other rights to
purchase shares of capital stock of VERITAS (with all such Newco securities
issued to former VERITAS security holders initially representing the VERITAS
Percentage Interest in Newco), all on the terms set out in this Agreement and in
the Certificate of Merger substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the
                                                       ---------            
"CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") and the applicable provisions of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DELAWARE LAW"); and (iii) the contribution by SSI, STI and
certain of their subsidiaries as herein specified to Newco, all on the terms
herein specified, of all Contributed Stock of the Contributed Companies (with
each of the Contributed Companies thereby becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of
Newco) and the Contributed Assets in consideration for the issuance by Newco to
SSI  of shares of Common Stock of Newco, $0.001 par value ("NEWCO COMMON
STOCK"), and the offer by Newco to grant to Employees who are holders of options
in SSI at the Effective Time (herein "OPTIONEES") options to purchase Newco
Common Stock  ("NEWCO OPTIONS") in exchange for cancellation of their respective
options to purchase Common Stock of SSI ("NEWCO EXCHANGE OFFER"), which Newco
Common Stock issued to SSI and Newco Options will represent in the aggregate a
fully diluted equity interest in Newco equal to the difference between 100% and
the VERITAS Percentage Interest.  The transactions described in subpart (iii) of
the foregoing sentence are collectively the "SEAGATE TRANSACTION."

     B.   The Newco Common Stock issued in the Merger and in the Seagate
Transaction and the offered exchange of Newco Options for Exchanged SSI Options
in the Seagate Transaction will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), pursuant to a Newco registration statement.

     C.   For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that (i) the Merger
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code and/or as an 
<PAGE>
 
exchange under the provisions of Section 351(a) of the Internal Revenue Code,
and (ii) that the Seagate Transaction, when taken together with the Merger,
qualify as an exchange under the provisions of Section 351 of the Internal
Revenue Code.

        NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

1.      PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

        1.1  The Organization of Newco and Merger Sub.  VERITAS has formed
             ----------------------------------------
Newco under the laws of the State of Delaware for the purposes of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger and in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement. Newco currently has no outstanding securities and has
conducted no business and, prior to the Effective Time, will not issue any
securities prior to the Effective Time, will conduct no business or
operations, will have no assets and will enter into no agreements nor incur
any obligations or Liabilities, except as required or contemplated by this
Agreement or necessary to perform its obligations hereunder. As soon as
practicable after the date of this Agreement, Newco shall form the Merger Sub
as a wholly-owned subsidiary, which will conduct no business prior to Closing
except as expressly contemplated hereunder.

        1.2  The Merger.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
             ----------
at the Effective Time, VERITAS will cause Merger Sub to execute and deliver,
and VERITAS will execute and deliver, a Certificate of Merger providing for
the Merger of Merger Sub with and into VERITAS, with VERITAS being the
surviving corporation upon the effectiveness of the Merger and thereby
becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco, pursuant to this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and in accordance with applicable provisions of the
Delaware Law as follows:

             (a)  Conversion of VERITAS Common Stock.  Each share of the
                  ----------------------------------              
Common Stock of VERITAS ("VERITAS COMMON STOCK"), that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will by virtue of the
Merger and at the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part
of VERITAS, Newco or any holder of VERITAS Common Stock, be converted into one
share (the "VERITAS EXCHANGE RATIO") of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Newco Common Stock.

             (b)  Conversion of  VERITAS Options, Warrants and other 
                  ---------------------------------------------------
Convertible Securities.
- ----------------------  

                  (i)  Conversion.  At the Effective Time, each of the then
                       ----------                                  
outstanding options to purchase shares of VERITAS Common Stock (collectively,
the "VERITAS OPTIONS") (consisting of all outstanding options granted under
VERITAS' or VERITAS' predecessors' option plans, including but not limited to
its 1985 Stock Option Plan, 1991 Executive Stock Option Plan, 1992 Stock Plan,
1993 Equity Incentive Plan, 1993 Director Stock Option Plan and 1996 Director
Option Plan (collectively the "VERITAS PLANS")), and each of the then
outstanding warrants to purchase VERITAS Common Stock (the "VERITAS WARRANTS")
and any individual non-Plan options, and any convertible debenture or other
convertible debt instrument convertible into VERITAS Common Stock ("VERITAS
DEBENTURES"), will, by virtue of the Merger, and without any further action on
the part of any holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an option,
warrant, convertible debenture, or other convertible debt instrument, as the
case may be, to purchase 

                                      -2-
<PAGE>
 
an equivalent number of shares of Newco Common Stock, at an exercise price per
share equal to the per share exercise price of such VERITAS Option or VERITAS
Warrant, or at a conversion price per share equal to the conversion price per
share of such VERITAS Debenture, as the case may be in effect at the Effective
Time, but with VERITAS remaining the obligor on any such convertible debenture
or other convertible debt instrument. The term, exercisability, vesting
schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the
Internal Revenue Code, if applicable, and all other terms and conditions of
the VERITAS Options and VERITAS Warrants and VERITAS Debentures will be
unchanged and all references in any option or warrant or debenture agreement
governing such option or warrant or debenture to VERITAS shall be deemed to
refer to Newco, where appropriate. Continuous service as an employee or
consultant with VERITAS or any of the VERITAS Subsidiaries (as hereinafter
defined) or VERITAS predecessors will be credited to an optionee of VERITAS
for purposes of determining the number of shares of Newco Common Stock subject
to exercise under a converted VERITAS Option after the Closing.

                  (ii) Stock Rights.  At the Effective Time, each of the then
                       ------------                                
outstanding rights to purchase shares of VERITAS Common Stock (collectively,
the "VERITAS STOCK PURCHASE PLAN RIGHTS"), consisting of all outstanding
options to purchase shares under VERITAS' 1993 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
and 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "VERITAS STOCK PURCHASE PLAN"),
will by virtue of the Merger, and without any further action on the part of
any holder thereof, be assumed and converted into a right to purchase the same
number of shares of Newco Common Stock on the next "Purchase Date" (as such
term is defined in the VERITAS Stock Purchase Plan) following the Effective
Time at a purchase price per share determined in accordance with the VERITAS
Stock Purchase Plan.

             (c)  Cancellation of VERITAS-Owned Shares.  Each share of VERITAS
                  ------------------------------------              
Common Stock held in the treasury of VERITAS or any of which are owned by
Newco, VERITAS, or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Newco,
VERITAS immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof.

        1.3  Seagate Transaction.
             -------------------

             (a)  Issuance of Newco Common Stock. At the Effective Time and
                  ------------------------------                  
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Newco will, in
consideration for the contribution and transfer of the Contributed Stock and
Assets to Newco as contemplated by this Agreement, perform the following:

                  (i)  SSI Stock.  Issue to SSI that number of validly issued,
                       ---------                                   
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Newco Common Stock which represents the
SSI Percentage Interest less the number of shares of Newco Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the Newco Options issued in exchange for Exchanged
SSI Options under clause (ii) below.

                  (ii) Exchange of Newco Options for Exchanged SSI Options.  
                       ---------------------------------------------------
Newco shall offer to issue Newco Options (each representing the right to
purchase validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Newco Common Stock) to
the Optionees in exchange for cancellation of their Exchanged SSI Options at
the Effective Time, all on the terms specified in this Agreement. At the

                                      -3-
<PAGE>
 
Effective Time, each of the options to purchase SSI Common Stock held by
any of the Optionees that elects to exchange for a Newco Option in response
to Newco's option exchange offer made pursuant hereto ("EXCHANGED SSI
OPTIONS"), will be exchanged for a Newco Option to purchase that number of
shares of Newco Common Stock determined by multiplying the number of shares
of SSI Common Stock subject to such Exchanged SSI Option at the Effective
Time by the "SSI Exchange Ratio" (as defined below) at an exercise price
per share of Newco Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of
such Exchanged SSI Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided
by the SSI Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent. The "SSI
EXCHANGE RATIO" shall mean the quotient arrived at by dividing the SSI Per
Share Value by the Newco Per Share Value. The "SSI PER SHARE VALUE" shall
equal (A) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Newco Common Stock which
represents the SSI Percentage Interest by (y) the VERITAS Closing Price
plus (B) the value of IMG (as determined by the Board of Directors of SSI
upon advice of Morgan Stanley & Co. ("Morgan")) all divided by (C) the
total number of outstanding shares of common stock of SSI on a fully
diluted as converted basis immediately prior to the Effective Time. Newco
Per Share Value shall equal the VERITAS Closing Price. The "VERITAS
CLOSING PRICE" shall mean the average closing price of one share of VERITAS
Common Stock for the five (5) most recent days that VERITAS Common Stock
has traded ending on the trading day three (3) business days prior to the
Effective Time, as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market. The SSI Exchange
Ratio, collectively with the VERITAS Exchange Ratio shall be referred to
herein as the "EXCHANGE RATIOS". If the foregoing calculation results in a
Newco Option issued in exchange for an Exchanged SSI Option being
exercisable for a fraction of a share of Newco Common Stock, then the
number of shares of Newco Common Stock subject to such option will be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares, with no cash being
payable for such resulting fractional share. The term, exercisability,
vesting schedule, status as an "incentive stock option" under Section 422
of the Internal Revenue Code, if applicable, and all other terms and
conditions of each Newco Option shall be the same as that of the Exchanged
SSI Option exchanged therefor. Continuous service as an employee or
consultant with SSI, STI or any of their direct or indirect subsidiaries
will be credited to each Optionee for purposes of determining the number of
shares of Newco Common Stock vested and exercisable under such exchanged
Newco Option after the Effective Time.

        1.4  Contribution and Transfer of Contributed Stock and Assets.
             ---------------------------------------------------------

             (a)  Contribution and Transfer. Subject to the terms and
                  --------------------------                      
conditions of this Agreement and in consideration for the issuance by Newco of
Newco Common Stock as provided above, the Contributing Companies shall at the
Effective Time, for good and valuable consideration receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged on behalf of each of the Contributing Companies
other than SSI, contribute and transfer and deliver to Newco or cause to be
contributed, transferred and delivered to Newco, and at the Effective Time
Newco shall accept the contribution and transfer from the Contributing
Companies, all right, title and interest in and to the Contributed Stock and
Assets. Specifically, SSI will transfer and contribute to Newco the
Contributed Stock and the Contributing Companies will transfer and contribute
to Newco the Contributed Assets. All Contributed Assets of STI shall be deemed
first contributed by STI to SSI and only then by SSI to Newco. Notwithstanding
the preceding, the parties hereto agree to transfer the Contributed Assets

                                      -4-
<PAGE>
 
which are located outside of the United States in a mutually agreeable manner.
For example, SSI contemplates the formation of a new entity in Australia
(which would become a Contributed Company) which would acquire the Australian
Contributed Assets from Seagate Software Pty. Ltd. Seagate Software Limited, a
company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom and Delaware, will
register branches in the countries of South Africa, Spain and Dubai.
Additionally, with respect to Contributed Assets located in France, Japan,
Sweden, and the Netherlands, such Assets may be purchased and sold by and
among the VERITAS and Seagate entities located in such countries in exchange
for the consideration contributed to Newco by SSI (for which SSI would receive
no additional Newco Common Stock beyond the amounts contemplated by this
Agreement). Furthermore, the parties shall cooperate to facilitate the
transfer, to the extent so desired, of employees related to Group Business in
the countries of Singapore and Malaysia.

             (b)  Assumption and Exclusion of Liabilities.
                  --------------------------------------- 

                  (i)  Assumed Liabilities.  As a result of the transfer to
                       -------------------                                
Newco of the Contributed Stock as aforesaid, Newco will as a matter of law own
all of the outstanding equity capital of the Contributed Companies, which
Contributed Companies in turn shall remain liable for their respective
Liabilities. In addition, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, Newco (or a subsidiary of Newco designated by Newco and acceptable
to SSI) shall, at the Effective Time, assume, and thereafter pay, perform and
discharge when due those (and only those) Liabilities of the Contributing

             (d)  Unassignable Assets.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
                  -------------------                   
this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, to the extent that any of
the Contributed Assets are not assignable or otherwise transferable by the
Contributing Companies to Newco without the consent, approval or waiver of
another party thereto or any third party (including any governmental agency),
or if such assignment or transfer would constitute a breach thereof or of any
other material contract binding upon the transferor or any of its affiliates,
or a violation of any applicable law, then neither this Agreement nor such
Ancillary Agreements shall constitute an assignment or transfer (or an
attempted assignment or transfer) thereof until such consent, approval or
waiver of such party or parties has been duly obtained. With respect to each
such Contributed Asset, whose assignment or transfer to Newco requires the
consent, approval or waiver of another party thereto or any third party, Newco
and SSI shall cooperate and use their mutual reasonable, commercial efforts to
obtain such consent, approval or waiver of such other party or parties or such
third party to such assignment or transfer as promptly as practicable prior to
the Effective Time; and each agrees to supply relevant information to such
party or parties or such third party in order to facilitate such objective.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall obligate Newco
or any Contributing Company to expend or pay any amount to third parties to
obtain any consents, approvals or waivers, or to make alternative arrangements
available; provided that where the Contributing Companies are unable to
effectively assign to Newco any Contributed Contract without breaching same
due to such lack of third party consent, the Contributing Companies shall make
available to Newco the economic benefits (such as inbound royalty payments),
if any, received by the Contributing Companies from and after the Effective
Time with respect to any such Contributed Contract.

             (e)  No Fraudulent Conveyance. The Contributing Companies are not
                  ------------------------                            
entering into this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement with the intent to
defraud, delay or hinder their respective creditors and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the Ancillary Agreements
referenced in this Agreement will not have any such effect. The transfer of
the Contributed Stock and Assets pursuant hereto will not give rise to any
right of any creditor of the Contributing Companies to assert any claim
whatsoever against Newco or any of the Contributed Stock and Assets in the
hands of Newco or any of Newco's respective successors and assigns following
the Effective Time which would have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco. SSI
and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a group are Solvent, and will
continue to be Solvent immediately following the transfer of the Contributed
Stock and Assets pursuant to this Agreement. Neither SSI nor any of its
consolidated subsidiaries nor any of the Contributed Stock and Assets is
subject to, or the subject of, any Insolvency Proceeding or Insolvency Action.

To Seagate's Knowledge (i) there is not any reason to expect that any of the
aforementioned actions, or any similar action, will take place or be taken,

action. The parties agree that the securities issued by Newco to SSI and the
Optionees and the other obligations on Newco's part to be performed under the
terms of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute full and fair

Governmental Antitrust Authority for additional information and documentary
material. The parties hereto will not take any action that will have the
effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the termination of any waiting
period or the receipt of any required approvals of a Government Antitrust
Authority. Without limiting the generality of the parties' undertakings
pursuant to this Section 1.11, the parties shall use their reasonable best
efforts to prevent the entry in a judicial or administrative proceeding
brought under any antitrust law by any Governmental Antitrust Authority or any
other party of any permanent or preliminary injunction or other order that
would make consummation of the Seagate Transaction or the Merger in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement unlawful under appropriate anti-trust laws or
that would prevent or delay such consummation as a consequence of such laws.
Each party hereto shall promptly inform the other of any material
communication between such party and the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Antitrust Authority regarding
any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If any party or any affiliate of

Governmental Antitrust Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, then such party shall endeavor in good faith to make or cause to be
made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other
parties, an appropriate response in compliance with such request. Further, no
written materials shall be submitted by any party to the Federal Trade
Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Antitrust

regulations of any other state or country, nor shall any oral communications
be initiated with such governmental entities by any party, without prior
disclosure to and coordination with the other parties and their counsel. Each
party hereto will cooperate in connection with reaching any understandings,

or contingent) which are, individually or in the aggregate, of a nature
required to be disclosed on the face of a consolidated balance sheet for SSI
and its consolidated subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP and which
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business, except for such
liabilities or obligations as (i) were accrued or provided for in the
consolidated balance sheet at July 3, 1998, included in the SSI Consolidated
Financial Statements as of the date thereof (the "SSI CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS BALANCE SHEET DATE") or (ii) are of a normally recurring nature and
were incurred after the SSI Consolidated Financial Statements Balance Sheet
Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. All
liabilities and valuation accounts established and reflected in the STI/SSI
Consolidated Financial Statements are, to Seagate's Knowledge, reasonably
adequate. At the SSI Consolidated Financial Statements Balance Sheet Date,
there were no material loss contingencies (as such term is used in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 ("STATEMENT NO. 5") issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board in March 1975) arising from the conduct
of the business of SSI and its consolidated subsidiaries which are required to
be provided for or disclosed, but are not provided for or disclosed, in the
SSI Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with Statement No. 5.

             (c)  Group Financial Statements; Absence of Undisclosed
                  --------------------------------------------------         
Liabilities.  Attached hereto as Schedule 2.4(c)(1) are the audited combined 
- -----------                      ------------------
financial statements of the Group Business dated as of July 3, 1998, including
a combined balance sheet as of July 3, 1998 (the "1998 GROUP BALANCE SHEET")
and a combined balance sheet for June 27, 1997, together with combined
statements of operations, cash flows, and Group Business equity for the three
years in the period ended July 3, 1998 (collectively the "GROUP FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS"). The Group Financial Statements comply in all material respects
with the then applicable accounting requirements and rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect thereto, and present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the Group
Business as of July 3, 1998 and June 27, 1997, and the combined results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
July 3, 1998, in conformity with GAAP. The Contributed Company Group and the
Contributing Companies (with respect to the Group Business) have no
Liabilities of 

                                      -13-
<PAGE>
 
any nature (matured or unmatured, fixed or contingent) which (i) are related
to or arose in connection with the Group Business; (ii) individually or in the
aggregate, are of a nature required to be recorded on the face of or disclosed
in the notes to the Group Financial Statements; and (iii) are material to the
Group Business taken as a whole, except for such Liabilities as (A) were
accrued , provided for or disclosed in the Group Financial Statements or (B)
are of a normally recurring nature and were incurred after July 3, 1998, the
date of the 1998 Group Balance Sheet (the "GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BALANCE
SHEET DATE"), in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. All liabilities and valuation accounts established and reflected in
the Group Financial Statements are, to Seagate's Knowledge, reasonably
adequate. At the Group Financial Statements Balance Sheet Date, there were no
material loss contingencies (as such term is defined in Statement No. 5) which
are not properly provided for or disclosed in the Group Financial Statements
as required by Statement No. 5.

        2.5  Disclosure; Information Supplied.  No representation or warranty
             --------------------------------
made by SSI or STI in this Agreement, nor any financial statement, certificate
or exhibit prepared and furnished or to be prepared and furnished by them, or
their respective representatives pursuant hereto or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, or in any Seagate SEC Document filed by
them, when taken together, contains any untrue statement of a material fact,
or omits to state a material fact necessary to make the statements or facts
contained herein or therein, taken as a whole, not misleading in light of the
circumstances under which they were furnished. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by STI or SSI for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Form S-4 and Prospectus/Proxy Statement will, at the time the
information is supplied contain, after giving effect to any supplement or
amendment thereto, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not materially misleading.

        2.6  Compliance with Applicable Laws.  Except as disclosed in the
             -------------------------------
Seagate SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Group
Business is not being conducted in violation of any law, ordinance,
regulation, rule or order of any governmental entity where such violation
would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business. Except as
disclosed in the Seagate SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, neither SSI, STI, any Contributing NSMG Company, nor any member of
the Contributed Company Group has been notified in writing by any governmental
entity that any investigation or review with respect to the Contributed
Companies or any of the Contributed Subsidiaries, any of the Group Assets or
the Group Business is pending or threatened, nor has any governmental entity
notified any of them in writing of its intention to conduct the same, which
investigation or review could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Group Business. The Group Assets include all permits,
licenses and franchises from governmental entities required for the Conduct of
the Group Business, except for those whose absence would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Group Business and then which would terminate as a
consequence of the Seagate Transaction.

        2.7  Litigation.  Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
             ----------
Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business or as set forth in Section 2.7
of the SSI Disclosure Letter or as disclosed in the Seagate SEC Documents,
there is no suit, action, arbitration, demand, claim or 

                                      -14-
<PAGE>
 
proceeding pending or, to Seagate's Knowledge, threatened against the
Contributed Company Group, the Contributing Companies or the Group Assets; nor
is there any judgment, decree, injunction, ruling or order of any governmental
entity or arbitrator or settlement agreement outstanding against the
Contributed Company Group or any of the Contributing Companies or the Group
Assets. SSI has delivered or made available to VERITAS or its counsel correct
and complete copies of all material correspondence prepared by its counsel for
SSI auditors in connection with the last two completed audits of SSI's
Financial Statements and the audit of the Group Financial Statements and any
such correspondence since the date of the last such audit. No member of the
Contributed Company Group and none of the Contributing Companies is a party to
any decree, order or arbitration award (or agreement entered into in any
administrative, judicial or arbitration proceeding with any governmental
authority) with respect to the Group Assets, Employees, or Group Business that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group
Business. Except for violations as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Group Business, none of the Contributing Companies nor any member of the
Contributed Company Group is in violation of any decree, order or arbitration
award that names such company, or any of such companies, as a party or that
otherwise, to Seagate's Knowledge, involves such company or any of the Group
Assets, or of any law, ordinance, statute, or governmental authority to which
the Group Assets or the Contributed Stock are subject, including, without
limitation, laws, rules and regulations relating to occupational health and
safety, equal employment opportunities, fair employment practices, and sex,
race, religious and age discrimination. To Seagate's Knowledge, there is no
claim, action, suit, arbitration, mediation, investigation or other proceeding
of any nature pending or, threatened, at law or in equity, by way of
arbitration or before any court, governmental department, commission, board or
agency that: (i) may adversely affect, contest or challenge any party's
authority, right or ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
any of the Ancillary Agreements; (ii) challenges or contests the Contributing
Companies' or the Contributed Companies' right, title or ownership of any of
the Group Assets or the Contributed Stock or seeks to impose an Encumbrance
(other than a Permitted Encumbrance) on, or a transfer of title or ownership
of, any of the Group Assets or the Contributed Stock; (iii) asserts that any
action taken by any employee, consultant or contractor of the Contributed
Companies or Contributing Companies in connection with the Group Business
infringes or misappropriates any Intellectual Property Rights of any third
party; (iv) seeks to enjoin, prevent or hinder operation of the Group
Business; (v) seeks to enjoin, prevent, or hinder the consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements; (vi) would impair or have an adverse affect on Newco's right or
ability to use or exploit any of the Group Assets; (vii) involves or relates
to any potentially material claim against Contributing Companies or the Group
Assets by any creditor thereof; or (viii) involves any claim of fraudulent
conveyance or any similar claim, except in cases (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) and
(vii) where such proceeding could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

        2.8  ERISA and Other Compliance.
             --------------------------

             (a)  Section 2.8 of the SSI Disclosure Letter lists each
employment, severance, compensation or other similar contract, arrangement or
policy and each plan or arrangement (written or oral) providing for insurance
coverage (including any self-insured arrangements), workers' 

                                      -15-
<PAGE>
 
benefits, vacation benefits, severance benefits, disability benefits, death
benefits, hospitalization benefits, retirement benefits, deferred
compensation, profit-sharing, bonuses, stock options, stock purchase, phantom
stock, stock appreciation or other forms of incentive compensation or post-
retirement insurance, compensation or benefits for employees, consultants or
directors (other than workers compensation, unemployment compensation and
other government mandated programs) which both (A) is entered into, maintained
or contributed to, as the case may be, by any member of the Contributed
Company Group or any of the Contributing Companies, and (B) covers any
Employee (collectively as the "GROUP BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS"). Each Group
Benefit Arrangement maintained by any member of the Contributed Company Group
has been maintained in substantial compliance with its terms and with the
requirements prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and regulations
which are applicable to such Group Benefit Arrangement except as would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business. Section 2.8(a) of the
SSI Disclosure Letter also identifies each "employee benefit plan," as defined
in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA") ("EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN"), in which any of the Employees
participate (collectively, the "GROUP EMPLOYEE PLANS"). Copies of all Group
Benefit Arrangements have been made available to VERITAS or its counsel. All
contributions or premiums currently due and payable with respect to any of the
Group Employee Plans have been made as required under ERISA or have been
accrued on the 1998 Group Balance Sheet or will be made prior to the Effective
Time.

             (b)  None of the Employee Benefit Plans maintained by any of the
Contributing Companies or any member of the Contributed Company Group (i) is a
multiemployer plan, within the meaning of Section 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA
(a "MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN"), or a single employer pension plan, within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, for which Newco could incur liability
und er Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLAN"), or (ii)
provides or promises to provide retiree medical or life insurance benefits
except in connection with (a) benefit coverage mandated by applicable law,
including without limitation, coverage provided pursuant to Section 4980B of
the Code; (b) death or disability benefits under any of the Group Benefit
Arrangements; (c) benefits arising in connection with a separation or
severance program, plan or arrangement; and (d) life insurance benefits for
any employee who dies while in service with any of the Contributing Companies
or any member of the Contributed Company Group. None of the Contributing
Companies or any member of the Contributed Company Group has incurred or will
incur prior to or as of the Effective Time any material liability under,
arising out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA (other than liability for
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation arising in the ordinary
course), including any liability in connection with (i) the termination or
reorganization of any employee pension benefit plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA or (ii) with withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan.

             (c)  The appropriate Contributing Company or Contributed Company
has timely provided, or will have provided prior to the Effective Time, to
Employees entitled thereto all required notices and made coverage available
pursuant to Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code and the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), with respect
to any "qualifying event" (as defined in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code). The appropriate Contributing Company or Contributed Company
will timely provide to 

                                      -16-
<PAGE>
 
Employees entitled thereto all required notices and make coverage available
pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 4980B and COBRA with respect to any
"qualifying event" (as defined in Section 4980B(f)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code) occurring prior to and including the Effective Time. No material Tax
payable on account of Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code has been
incurred by the Contributing Companies or any of the Contributed Companies
with respect to any current Employees (or their beneficiaries).

             (d)  No benefit payable or which may become payable by any of the
Contributed Companies or by any of the Contributing Companies with respect to
any Employee shall constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code).

             (e)  The Contributed Companies Group and the Contributing
Companies are in compliance with all applicable laws, agreements and contracts
relating to employment, employment practices, wages, hours, and terms and
conditions of employment (including, but not limited to, employee compensation
matters) with respect in all such cases to the Employees, except where the
failure to be in compliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

             (f)  The Contributed Company Group and the Contributing Companies
have, to Seagate's Knowledge, good labor relations and to Seagate's Knowledge
there are no facts indicating that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will have a Material Adverse Effect on labor relations
with Employees or that any of the Employees intends to leave its or their
employ, where the same would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group
Business.

             (g)  To Seagate's Knowledge, no Employee who is a key developer
of a Group Product is subject to any agreement, obligation, order or other
legal hindrance that impedes or might impede such executive or key employee
from devoting his or her full business time to the affairs of Newco after the
Effective Time.

             (h)  The Contributed Companies Group and the Contributing
Companies have, to Seagate's Knowledge and with respect only to the Employees,
complied with all laws, rules and regulations relating to the employment of
labor, including provisions thereof relating to wages, hours, equal
opportunity, collective bargaining and the payment of social security and
other Taxes, except where non-compliance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Group Business.

             (i)  The Contributed Companies are not indebted to any executive
officer or director of such Contributed Company, whether by loan, advance or
otherwise, other than for salaries accrued but not yet payable and
reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and not yet payable, nor, except as
described on Schedule 2.8(i) to the SSI Disclosure Letter is any officer,
director, employee or shareholder so indebted to any of SSI or any of the
Contributed Companies, except as disclosed in the 1998 Group Balance Sheet or
the Seagate SEC Documents, nor does any Employee have any right to force SSI
or any Contributing Company to repurchase any stock.

Incorporation or Bylaws of any member of the Contributed Company Group;

Group Business;

become binding upon Newco upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
herein, for or with respect to any of the Employees, other than (i) in the

                                      -19-

filed prior to the date of this Agreement, to Seagate's Knowledge, there
exists no event (including closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), condition or occurrence which, after notice or lapse of time, or
both, would constitute a default by under any Contributed Contract in an

(including, without limitation, severance, unemployment compensation, golden
parachute, bonus or otherwise) becoming due by any member of the Contributed

        2.14  Taxes. The Contributed Companies and, with respect to the Group
              -----
Businesses, the Contributing Companies, have filed, or caused to be filed, all
Tax returns required to be filed by them and have paid, or caused to be paid,
all Taxes that are shown on such Tax returns as due and payable, other than
such Taxes as are being contested in good faith and for which adequate
liabilities have been established on the 1998 Group Balance Sheet, other than
where the failure to so file, pay or withhold would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Group Business. All Taxes required to have been paid or
accrued by the Contributed Companies and, with respect to the Group
Businesses, the Contributing Companies for all periods prior to the 1998 Group
Balance Sheet have been fully paid (except for Taxes that are adequately
provided for or reflected in the 1998 Group Balance Sheet) except where a
failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group
Business. Since the date of the 1998 Group Balance Sheet, no material Tax
liability relating to the Group Business has been assessed, or is, to
Seagate's Knowledge, proposed to be assessed, incurred or accrued (other than
liabilities for Taxes arising in the ordinary course of business). To
Seagate's

Knowledge, Seagate has not received any notification that any material issues
have been raised (or are currently pending) by the Internal Revenue Service or
any other taxing authority, including, without limitation, any sales tax
authority, in connection with any of the Tax returns referred to in the first
sentence of this Section 2.14, and no waivers of statutes of limitations have
been given or requested with respect to Tax returns or Taxes related to the
Group Business or SSI and its consolidated subsidiaries. No taxing authority
is currently conducting an audit of any of the aforesaid Tax returns or to
Seagate's Knowledge is about to conduct such an audit with respect to the
Group Business. Any deficiencies asserted or assessments (including interest
and penalties) made as a result of any examination by the Internal Revenue
Service or by appropriate national, state or departmental authorities of the
Tax returns with respect to the Group Business or the Contributed Companies
have been fully paid or are adequately provided for in the 1998 Group Balance
Sheet, except where a failure to do so would not have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Group Business, and, to Seagate's Knowledge, no material
proposed (but unassessed) additional Taxes have been asserted and no Tax liens
have been filed with respect to the Group Business or the Contributed
Companies or against any of the Group Assets other than for Taxes not yet due
and payable. None of the members of the Contributed Company Group (i) has made
an election to be treated as a "consenting corporation" under Section 341(f)
of the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) is a "personal holding company" within
the meaning of Section 542 of the Internal Revenue Code. This representation
does not apply to Taxes or Tax matters relating to Taxes for which Newco and
its affiliates are entitled to indemnification under Section 13 hereof.

        2.15  Intellectual Property.
              ---------------------

              (a)  The Contributed Companies and, insofar as it relates to
the Group Business, the Contributing Companies own, or have the right to use,
sell or license such Intellectual Property Rights as are necessary or required
for the Conduct of the Group Business (such Intellectual Property Rights being
hereinafter collectively referred to as the "SEAGATE IP RIGHTS") and such
ownership or rights to use, sell or license are reasonably sufficient for such
conduct of the Group Business, except for any failure to own or have the right
to use, sell or license that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Group Business.

              (b)  All Seagate IP Rights are owned free and clear of any
Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances).

              (c)  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
constitute a material breach of any material instrument or material agreement
in respect of any Seagate IP Rights licensed by or to any Contributing Company
or Contributed Company (the "SEAGATE IP RIGHTS AGREEMENTS"), will not cause
the forfeiture or termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or
termination of any Seagate IP Right or materially impair the right of Newco to
use, sell or license any Seagate IP Right or portion thereof (except where
such breach, forfeiture, termination or impairment would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Group Business);

              (d)  There are no royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments
payable by any member of the Contributed Company Group or any Contributing
Company to any person by reason 

                                      -22-
<PAGE>
 
of the ownership, use, license, purchase, sale or disposition or acquisition
of any of the Seagate IP Rights in an amount exceeding $100,000 in any one
year;

                (e)  To Seagate's Knowledge, no third party is infringing or
misappropriating any of the Seagate IP Rights.

                (f)  To Seagate's Knowledge, (i) neither the manufacture,
marketing, license, sale or intended use of any Group Product violates any
license or agreement relating thereto or infringes any Intellectual Property
Right of any other party, (ii) there is no pending or threatened claim or
litigation contesting the validity, ownership or right to use, sell, license
or dispose of any Seagate IP Right, and (iii) no third party has notified the
Contributing Companies or the Contributed Company Group that any Seagate IP
Right, or the proposed use, sale, license or disposition thereof, conflicts or
will conflict with the rights of any other party, nor is there any basis
therefor, except for any violations, infringements, claims or litigation that
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business.

                (g)  The Contributing Companies and the Contributed Company
Group have taken reasonable and practicable steps designed to safeguard and
maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of, and its proprietary rights in,
all material trade secrets or other confidential information constituting
Seagate IP Rights. To Seagate's Knowledge, no current or prior officers,
employees or consultants of the Contributing Companies or the Contributed
Company Group claim an ownership interest in any Seagate IP Rights as a result
of having been involved in the development of such property while so employed,
or retained, or otherwise. To Seagate's Knowledge, all development employees
of the Seagate IP Rights, and all other officers, employees and consultants of
the Contributed Company Group have executed and delivered an agreement
regarding the protection of proprietary information and the assignment to
his/her employer or principal of the Seagate IP Rights arising from the
services performed by such persons, except where this absence of such
agreement would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business.

                (h)  Section 2.15(h) of the SSI Disclosure Letter sets forth
and summarizes each of the Seagate IP Rights as of the date of this Agreement
the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group
Business that a third party owns and that SSI or the Contributed Business
Group uses pursuant to a license, sublicense, agreement or other permission,
and describes and identifies such license, sublicense, agreement or other
permission (excluding shrink wrap licenses to commercially available software
sold at retail). Such license, sublicense, agreement or permission covering
the item is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect
and will continue to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force
and effect on identical terms to Newco's benefit immediately following the
Effective Time, except where it would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Newco, and such license, sublicense, agreement or permission does not restrict
the ability to market any material Group Product in any material jurisdiction
or with respect to any material market or industry, and neither SSI nor the
Contributed Company Group is in breach or default of any such license,
sublicense, agreement or permission in a manner which would have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Group Business. No person other than the Contributing
Companies holds any license or other right to manufacture, modify, or create
derivative works of any of the 

                                      -23-
<PAGE>
 
Group Products, other than OEM agreements that would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Group Business. No person (other than Newco) will be or
become entitled to receive a copy of source code of any software included
among the Group Assets as a result of this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement
or any other agreement or transaction contemplated by this Agreement. To
Seagate's Knowledge, no person holds or has been granted access to any copy of
source code of any software included among the Group Assets unless such person
has agreed in writing (i) to hold such source code in confidence and take
reasonable steps to preserve the secrecy of such source code, and (ii) not to
use such source code for any purpose except (A) to support such person's
internal use of such source code or (B) to modify such source code solely for
the purpose of internally using such modifications. None of SSI or the
Contributed Companies have knowingly taken or knowingly failed to take any
action that, directly or indirectly, has caused any Intellectual Property
Rights in source code of material Group Products to enter the public domain,
such as would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business.

        2.16  Fees and Expenses.  Except for the fees and expenses set forth
              -----------------
in SSI's engagement letter with Morgan, a copy of which has been provided to
VERITAS (the "MORGAN STANLEY ENGAGEMENT LETTER), no member of the Contributed
Company Group and none of the Contributing Companies has paid or become
obligated to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or intermediary
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements.

        2.17  Insurance.  The members of the Contributed Company Group
              ---------
maintain fire and casualty, general liability, business interruption,
directors and officers, product liability and sprinkler and water damage
insurance that they believe to be reasonably prudent for their respective
businesses.

        2.18  Ownership of Property.  Except for Permitted Encumbrances, the
              ---------------------
Contributed Company Group and the Contributing Companies own, or at the
Effective Time will own, the Contributed Company Assets, free and clear of all
Encumbrances. All real and personal property included in the Group Assets is
operational and suitable for its intended use, subject to ordinary wear and
tear. To Seagate's Knowledge, no member of the Contributed Company Group is in
violation in any material respect with any zoning, building or safety
ordinance, regulation or requirement or other law or regulation applicable to
the operation of its respective owned or leased properties (the violation of
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business ).

        2.19  Environmental Matters.
              ---------------------

              (a)  During the period that the Contributed Companies and the
Contributing Companies (with respect to the Group Assets or any real estate
leased thereunder) have leased or owned their respective properties or owned
or operated their respective facilities, there have been, to Seagate's
Knowledge, no disposals, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous
Materials on, from, under or about such properties or facilities which would
cause a Material Adverse Effect on Newco. To Seagate's Knowledge there is no
presence, disposals, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Materials
on, from, under or about any of such properties or facilities, which may have
occurred prior to said Member of the Contributed Company Group or the
Contributing Companies

                                      -24-
<PAGE>
 
(with respect to the Group Assets or any real estate leased thereunder) having
taken possession of any of such properties or facilities, where such Hazardous
Materials would cause a Material Adverse Effect on the Newco.

              (b)  None of the properties or facilities which are Group
Assets is or has been the subject of an Environmental Violation, which would
cause a Material Adverse Effect on Newco. During the time that a Member of the
Contributed Company Group or the Contributing Companies (with respect to the
Group Assets or any real estate leased thereunder) owned or leased its
respective properties and facilities, none of said companies and, to Seagate's
Knowledge, no third party, used, generated, manufactured or stored on, under
or about such properties or facilities or transported to or from such
properties or facilities any Hazardous Materials (except those Hazardous
Materials associated with general office use or janitorial supplies) in a
manner which would result in a Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

              (c)  During the time that any member of the Contributed
Company Group and the Contributing Companies (with respect to the Group Assets
or any real estate leased thereunder) owned or leased its respective
properties and facilities, to Seagate's Knowledge, there has been no
litigation brought or threatened against any such Company, or any settlement
reached by any such Company with, any party or parties concerning the
presence, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Materials
on, from or under any of such properties or facilities or relating to any
alleged Environmental Violation, except for litigation or settlement which
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

        2.20  Interested Party Transactions.  Except as disclosed in the
              -----------------------------
Seagate SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, no officer or
director of a Contributing Company, or any "affiliate" or "associate" (as
those terms are defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) of a
Contributing Company has, either directly or indirectly, a material interest
in: (i) any person or entity which purchases from or sells, licenses or
furnishes to the Contributed Company Group in connection with the Group
Business, any goods, property, technology or intellectual or other property
rights or services; or (ii) any Contributed Contract; which, in the case of
either subpart (i) or (ii) would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group
Business.

        2.21  Fairness Opinion.  SSI's Board of Directors has received an
              ----------------
opinion dated as of the date hereof from Morgan to the effect that, as of the
date hereof, the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements are fair to SSI's stockholders from a financial point
of view.

        2.22  Title to and Condition and Sufficiency of Group Assets.  A
              ------------------------------------------------------
Member of the Contributed Company Group and/or a Contributing Company owns or
at the Closing will own the Group Assets and have good and marketable title
thereto, free and clear of all Encumbrances whatsoever, other than the
Permitted Encumbrances. The Group Assets transferred to Newco constitute all
assets, properties, rights, contracts and Intellectual Property Rights that
are necessary or required for the Conduct of the Group Business, without (i)
the need to purchase, license or acquire any other material asset or property;
(ii) violating any contractual rights of any third party; or (iii) infringing,
misappropriating or misusing any software or Intellectual Property Rights of
any 

                                      -25-
<PAGE>
 
third party, except for such assets, properties, rights, contracts, software
and Intellectual Property Rights, the absence of which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business. Title to all Group Assets is
freely transferable to, and will be transferred to, Newco free and clear of
all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. Such transfer can occur
without obtaining the consent or approval of any person, except where the
failure to transfer the Group Asset would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Newco. To the extent that VERITAS is assuming obligations that have an
associated deferred revenue on the 1998 Group Balance Sheet, the cash
associated with such deferred revenue shall be transferred to Newco. At the
Closing, the Contributing Companies will contribute, transfer and deliver to
Newco all right, title and interest in and to all Group Assets, free and clear
of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. The Group Products
includes all software under development by the Group Business.

        2.23  No Restrictive Agreements. Other than this Agreement and the
              -------------------------
Ancillary Agreements, neither any Member of the Contributed Company Group nor
SSI nor any of the Group Assets is bound, or materially and adversely affected
by, any judgment, injunction, order, decree, contract, covenant or agreement
(noncompete or otherwise) that restricts or prohibits (or purports to restrict
or prohibit) the Conduct of the Group Business or from competing for the sale
of the Group Products anywhere in the world (including without limitation any
contracts, covenants or agreements restricting the geographic area in which
the Group Business may sell, license, market, distribute or support any Group
Products or restricting the markets, customers or industries that Newco may
address after the Closing in the Conduct of the Group Business (collectively,
"RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS"), in a manner, in any of the foregoing cases, which
will have a Material Adverse Effect upon Newco.

        2.24  Supplier and Customer Relationships.  To Seagate's Knowledge,
              -----------------------------------
(i) the Contributed Company Group has good commercial working relationships
with the customers for the Group Business, and (ii) since January 1, 1998, no
customer of, or supplier to the Group Business has canceled or otherwise
terminated any material relationship concerning the Group Business with the
Contributed Company Group or SSI (with respect to the Group), or materially
decreased or limited its purchases or provision of materials supplied to the
Group Business or under any Material Contributed Contract from the
corresponding period in 1997, where any of the foregoing actions would cause a
Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business, and to Seagate's Knowledge, no
customer or supplier has threatened to take any such action.

        2.25  Product and Inventory Status.
              ----------------------------

              (a)  Product Quality, Warranty Claims.  All Group Products
                   --------------------------------           
manufactured, sold, licensed, leased or delivered in connection with the Group
Business conform in all material respects to applicable contractual
commitments, express and implied warranties, and, to Seagate's Knowledge,
there is no material Liability (nor any basis for any present or future
action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or
demand giving rise to any material Liability) for replacement or repair
thereof or other damages in connection therewith, except for such conformance
as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

             (b)  Inventory.  To Seagate's Knowledge, its inventories
                  ---------                                 
recorded on the 1998 Group Balance Sheet consist primarily of materials used
in software products, related supplies and packaging materials, all of which
are merchantable, fit for the purpose for which they were procured or
manufactured, and are in a condition and quantity usable in the ordinary
course of business and to Seagate's Knowledge, none of these inventories are
obsolete, damaged or defective, except in each case where the failure of these
inventories to be so would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco or
where a sufficient provision with respect to the possibility of such failure
is included in the 1998 Group Balance Sheet.

order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under

respects with the then applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC thereunder. VERITAS has filed all documents and agreements that were
required to be filed as exhibits to the VERITAS SEC Documents.

to any current or former employees (or their beneficiaries).

laws, agreements and contracts relating to employment, employment practices,
wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited

the failure to be in compliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Newco.

                (f)  The VERITAS Group has, to VERITAS' Knowledge, good labor
relations and to VERITAS' Knowledge there are no facts indicating that the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will have a material

any VERITAS IP Rights (the "VERITAS IP RIGHTS AGREEMENTS"), will not cause the
forfeiture or termination or give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination
of any VERITAS IP Right or materially impair the right of Newco to use, sell or
license any VERITAS IP Right or portion thereof (except where such breach,
forfeiture, termination or impairment would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on VERITAS).

              (d)  There are no royalties, honoraria, fees or other payments
payable by any member of the VERITAS Group to any person by reason of the
ownership, use, license, purchase, sale or disposition or acquisition of any of

except for any violations, infringements, claims or litigation that would not
have a Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS.

              (g)  VERITAS has taken reasonable and practicable steps designed
to safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of, and its
proprietary rights in, all material trade secrets or other confidential
information constituting VERITAS IP Rights. To VERITAS' Knowledge, no current
or prior officers, employees or consultants of VERITAS claim an ownership
interest in any VERITAS IP Rights as a result of having been involved in the
development of such property while so employed, or retained, or otherwise. To
VERITAS' Knowledge, all development employees of the VERITAS IP Rights, and
all other officers, employees and consultants of VERITAS have executed and
delivered to VERITAS or the VERITAS Subsidiary an agreement regarding the
protection of proprietary information and the assignment to VERITAS or the
VERITAS Subsidiary of all Intellectual Property Rights arising from the
services performed for VERITAS or the VERITAS Subsidiary by such persons,
except where the absence of such an agreement would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on VERITAS.

              (h)  Section 3.15(h) of the VERITAS Disclosure Letter sets forth
and summarizes each of the VERITAS IP Rights, the absence of which would have
a Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS, that a third party owns and that VERITAS
uses pursuant to a license, sublicense, agreement or other permission and
describes and identifies such license, sublicense, agreement or other
permission (excluding shrink wrap licenses to commercially available software
sold at retail). Such license, sublicense, agreement or permission covering
the item is legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect
and will continue to be legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force
and effect on identical terms to Newco's benefit immediately following the
Effective Time, except where it would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Newco, and such license, sublicense, agreement or permission does not restrict
VERITAS' ability to market any material VERITAS Product in any material
jurisdiction or with respect to any market or industry, and VERITAS is not in
breach or default of any such license, sublicense, agreement or permission. No
person other than VERITAS holds any license or other right to manufacture,
modify, or create derivative works based on any of the VERITAS Products, other
than OEM agreements that would not have a Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS.
No person (other than Newco) will be or become entitled to receive a copy of
source code of any software included among the VERITAS Assets as a result of
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or any other agreement or transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. To VERITAS' Knowledge, no person holds or has
been granted access to any copy of source code of any software included among
the VERITAS Assets unless such person has agreed in writing (i) to hold such
source code in confidence and take reasonable steps to preserve the secrecy of
such source code; and (ii) not to use such source code for any purpose except
to support such person's internal use of such source code or to modify such
source code solely for the purpose of internally using such modifications.
VERITAS has not knowingly taken or knowingly failed to take any action that,
directly or indirectly, has caused any Intellectual Property Rights in source
code of material VERITAS Products to enter the public domain such as would
have a Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS.

        3.16  Fees and Expenses.  Except for the fees and expenses set forth in
              -----------------
VERITAS' engagement letter with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corporation ("DLJ"), a copy of which has been provided to STI and SSI, neither
VERITAS, Newco nor any of the VERITAS Subsidiaries has paid or become obligated
to pay any fee or commission to any broker, finder or 

                                      -39-
<PAGE>
 
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements.

        3.17  Insurance.  The members of the VERITAS Group maintain fire and
              ---------
casualty, general liability, business interruption, directors and officers,
product liability and sprinkler and water damage insurance that they believe to
be reasonably prudent for their respective businesses.

        3.18  Ownership of Property.  Except for VERITAS Permitted Encumbrances,
              ---------------------
the VERITAS Group owns, or at the Effective Time will own, the VERITAS Assets,
free and clear of all Encumbrances. All real and personal property included in
the VERITAS Assets is operational and suitable for its intended use, subject to
ordinary wear and tear. To VERITAS' Knowledge, no member of the VERITAS Group is
in violation in any material respect with any zoning, building or safety
ordinance, regulation or requirement or other law or regulation applicable to
the operation of its respective owned or leased properties (the violation of
which would have a Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS).

        3.19  Environmental Matters.
              ---------------------

              (a)  During the period that VERITAS has leased or owned its
respective properties or owned or operated their respective facilities, there
have been, to VERITAS' Knowledge, no disposals, releases or threatened releases
of Hazardous Materials on, from, under or about such properties or facilities
which would cause a Material Adverse Effect on Newco. To VERITAS' Knowledge
there is no presence, disposals, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous
Materials on, from, under or about any of such properties or facilities, which
may have occurred prior to VERITAS having taken possession of any of such
properties or facilities which would cause a Material Adverse Effect on the
Newco.

              (b)  None of the properties or facilities of VERITAS is or has
been the subject of an Environmental Violation, which would cause a Material
Adverse Effect on Newco. During the time that VERITAS has owned or leased its
respective properties and facilities, none of VERITAS nor, to VERITAS'
Knowledge, any third party, has used, generated, manufactured or stored on,
under or about such properties or facilities or transported to or from such
properties or facilities any Hazardous Materials (except those Hazardous
Materials associated with general office use or janitorial supplies) in a manner
which would result in a Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

              (c)  During the time that any members of the VERITAS Group have
owned or leased their respective properties and facilities, there has been no
litigation brought or, to VERITAS' Knowledge, threatened against any of them by,
or any settlement reached by any of them with, any party or parties concerning
the presence, disposal, release or threatened release of any Hazardous Materials
on, from or under any of such properties or facilities or relating to any
alleged Environmental Violation, except for litigation or settlement which would
not have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

        3.20  Interested Party Transactions.  Except as disclosed in the VERITAS
              -----------------------------
SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement, no officer or director
of VERITAS, or any "affiliate" or 

                                      -40-
<PAGE>
 
"associate" (as those terms are defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the
Securities Act) of VERITAS has, either directly or indirectly, a material
interest in: (i) any person or entity which purchases from or sells, licenses or
furnishes to the VERITAS Group in connection with the VERITAS Business, any
goods, property, technology or intellectual or other property rights or
services; or (ii) any VERITAS Contract, which in the case of either subpart (i)
or (ii) would have a Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS.

        3.21  Fairness Opinion.  VERITAS' Board of Directors has received an
              ----------------
opinion dated as of the date hereof from DLJ to the effect that, as of the date
hereof, the VERITAS Exchange Ratio is fair to VERITAS from a financial point of
view.

        3.22  Title to and Condition and Sufficiency of VERITAS Assets.  The
              --------------------------------------------------------
VERITAS Group owns, or at the Effective Time will own, all of the VERITAS Assets
and has good and marketable title in and to all of the VERITAS Assets, free and
clear of all Encumbrances whatsoever, other than the VERITAS Permitted
Encumbrances. The VERITAS Assets constitute all assets, properties, rights,
VERITAS Contracts and Intellectual Property Rights that are necessary or
required for the Conduct of the VERITAS Business without (i) the need to
purchase, license or acquire any other material asset or property; (ii)
violating any contractual rights of any third party; or (iii) infringing,
misappropriating or misusing any software or Intellectual Property Rights of any
third party in a manner, except for such assets, properties, rights, contracts,
software and Intellectual Property Rights, the absence of which would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS. Except for the consents and approvals
identified on Section 3.22 of the VERITAS Disclosure Letter, title to all
VERITAS Assets is freely transferable to VERITAS free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than VERITAS Permitted Encumbrances, and without obtaining
the consent or approval of any person, except where the failure to transfer the
VERITAS Asset would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco.

        3.23  No Restrictive Agreements.  Other than this Agreement and the
              -------------------------   
Ancillary Agreements Neither VERITAS nor any of the VERITAS Assets is bound or
materially and adversely affected by, any judgment, injunction, order, decree,
contract, covenant or agreement (noncompete or otherwise) that restricts or
prohibits (or purports to restrict or prohibit) the Conduct of the VERITAS
Business or from competing for the sale of VERITAS Products anywhere in the
world (including without limitation any contracts, covenants or agreements
restricting the geographic area in which the VERITAS Business may sell, license,
market, distribute or support any VERITAS Products or restricting the markets,
customers or industries that Newco may address after the Effective Time in the
Conduct of the VERITAS Business) (collectively, "RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS"), in a
manner which will have a Material Adverse Effect upon Newco.

        3.24  Supplier and Customer Relationships.  To VERITAS' Knowledge,
              -----------------------------------
VERITAS has good commercial working relationships with the customers for the
VERITAS Business, and since January 1, 1998, no customer or supplier has
canceled or otherwise terminated any material relationship with VERITAS, or
materially decreased or limited its purchases or provision of materials supplied
to VERITAS from the corresponding period in 1997, where any of the foregoing

                                      -41-
<PAGE>
 
actions would cause a Material Adverse Effect on VERITAS, and to VERITAS'
Knowledge, no customer or supplier has threatened to take any such action.

        3.25  Product and Inventory Status.
              ----------------------------

              (a)  Product Quality, Warranty Claims.  All VERITAS Products
                   --------------------------------               
manufactured, sold, licensed, leased or delivered in connection with the VERITAS
Business conform in all material respects to applicable contractual commitments,
express and implied warranties, and to VERITAS' Knowledge, there is no material
Liability (nor any basis for any present or future action, suit, proceeding,
hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim or demand giving rise to any
material Liability) for replacement or repair thereof or other damages in
connection therewith, except for such conformance as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on Newco.

              (b)  Inventory.  To VERITAS' Knowledge, its inventories recorded
                   ---------                         
on the VERITAS Financial Statements consist primarily of materials used in
software products, related supplies and packaging materials, all of which are
merchantable, fit for the purpose for which they were procured or manufactured,
and are in a condition of quantity usable in the ordinary course of business and
to VERITAS' Knowledge, none of these inventories are obsolete, damaged or
defective, except in each case where the failure of these inventories to be so
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Newco or where a sufficient
provision with respect to the possibility of such failure is included in the
VERITAS Financial Statements.

        3.26  Tax Representations.  VERITAS and Newco are aware of no plan or
              -------------------
intention by VERITAS or Newco or any corporation related to VERITAS immediately
after the Effective Time to repurchase any Newco capital stock issued pursuant
to this Agreement from any person or entity that is or will become a Newco
stockholder by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
VERITAS has not redeemed any shares of its capital stock or paid any
extraordinary dividend in contemplation of the Merger.

of each of STI, SSI, the Contributing Companies and the Contributed Company
Group have approved the Seagate Transaction and this Agreement.

        4.5  Letter of  SSI's Accountants.  SSI shall use its reasonable best

efforts to cause to be delivered to VERITAS a letter of Ernst & Young LLP dated
a date within two business days before the date on which the Form S-4 shall
become effective and addressed to VERITAS, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to VERITAS and customary in scope and substance for letters

             --------------------------
option holders in a timely manner, for the purpose of evaluating the Seagate
Transaction, the Prospectus/Proxy Statement in the Form S-4. SSI, VERITAS and
Newco will prepare and file the Proxy Statement/Prospectus with the SEC as
promptly as practicable, and each will use its respective best 

                                      -44-
<PAGE>
 
reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-4 to become effective as soon after such
filing as practicable. In this regard, SSI, VERITAS and Newco will advise each
other promptly as to the time at which the Form S-4 becomes effective and of the
issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the 
Form S-4 or the initiation of any proceedings for such purpose and each will use
its respective reasonable best efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order
and to obtain as soon as possible the lifting thereof, if issued. Until the

the SEC for any amendment or supplement of the Form S-4 or for additional
information, and will not at any time file any amendment of or supplement to the
prospectus contained therein (or to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)
of the SEC) which shall not have been previously submitted to SSI in reasonable
time prior to the proposed filing thereof or to which SSI shall reasonably
object or which is not in compliance in all material respects with the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations issued by the SEC thereunder. None
of the information relating to SSI (or, to Seagate's Knowledge, any other
person, contained in any document, certificate or other writing furnished or to
be furnished by SSI) included in (i) the Prospectus/Proxy Statement at the time
the Prospectus/Proxy Statement is mailed or at the Effective Time, as then
amended or supplemented, or (ii) the Form S-4 at the time the Form S-4 becomes
effective or at the Effective Time, as then amended or supplemented, will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or will omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading
or necessary to correct any statement which has become false or misleading in
any earlier communication. From and after the date the Form S-4 becomes
effective and until the Effective Time, if any event known to SSI occurs as a
result of which the Prospectus would include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time
to amend the Form S-4 or the Prospectus/Proxy Statement to comply with the
Securities Act, SSI will promptly notify VERITAS and Newco and an amended or
supplemented Form S-4 or Prospectus/Proxy Statement will be prepared by VERITAS
and Newco which will correct such statement or omission and will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become effective as
promptly as possible. The Prospectus/Proxy Statement, as it relates to SSI and
information relating to the Group Business, will comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder in effect at the time the Prospectus/Proxy Statement is
mailed.

Group, to execute and file, or join in the execution and filing, of any
application or other document that may be necessary in order to obtain the
authorization, approval or consent of any governmental body, federal, state,
local or foreign, which may be reasonably required, or which VERITAS or Newco
may reasonably request, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. STI and SSI will themselves, and will cause each
member of the Contributed Company Group, to use its reasonable efforts to
promptly obtain all such authorizations, approvals and consents and will
cooperate fully with the other parties in promptly seeking to obtain the same.

             ------------------
Contributing Company and each member of the Contributed Company Group to, use
its reasonable efforts to obtain those consents required in connection with the
Material Contributed Contracts, and to take such other actions as may be
necessary or appropriate for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and to allow Newco to Conduct the Group Business after the Effective

        4.9  Access to Information.  From the date of this Agreement until the
             ---------------------
Effective Time, each of STI and SSI will themselves, and will cause the
Contributed Company Group, to allow VERITAS and its agents reasonable access to
the files, books, records, technology and offices of SSI and the Contributed
Company Group reasonably requested by VERITAS, but only to the extent necessary
and relating to the Group Business, including, without limitation, any and all
information relating to Contributed Company Group's Taxes, commitments,
contracts, leases, licenses and real, personal, intellectual and intangible
property and financial condition. Each of STI and SSI shall use its reasonable
efforts to cause its accountants to cooperate with VERITAS and its agents in
making available to VERITAS all financial information reasonably requested,
including, without limitation, the right to examine all working papers
pertaining to all Tax returns and financial statements prepared or audited by
such accountants. No information or knowledge obtained by any party hereto in
any investigation pursuant to this Section 4.9 will affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger. All information obtained by
VERITAS and its agents pursuant to this Section 4.9 shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the confidentiality agreement, between VERITAS, STI, and SSI
(the "NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT").

        4.10  Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent.  STI and SSI will
              ------------------------------------

Company Group, to use reasonable efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all

Merger, the Seagate Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with
the agreements to be reached by the parties subsequent to the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, the parties agree to negotiate in

Company and each member of the Contributed Company Group and their respective
officers, directors or employees or any investment bankers, attorneys or other
advisors or representatives retained by any of them, to cease any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Contributed Group Alternative Proposal (as
defined below). From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, STI and SSI shall not authorize or permit any Contributing Company or any
member of the Contributed Company Group (or any of their respective officers,
directors or employees or any investment bankers, attorneys or other advisors or
representatives retained by any of them), directly or indirectly, (i) to
solicit, initiate or encourage the submission of 

                                      -46-
<PAGE>
 
any Contributed Group Alternative Proposal, (ii) to engage in discussions or

take any other action intended, designed or reasonably likely to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Contributed Group Alternative Proposal, (iii) to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or
other similar agreement with any person with respect to any Contributed Group
Alternative Proposal, or (iv) to make or authorize any statement, recommendation
or solicitation in support of any Contributed Group Alternative Proposal. For
purposes of this Agreement, "CONTRIBUTED GROUP ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any person or "group" (as defined under Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) relating to
any direct or indirect (a) acquisition, purchase, sale or other disposition of
any of the Group Assets (other than in the ordinary course and disposal of worn
or obsolete items consistent with past practice), (b) acquisition, purchase,
sale or other disposition of any of the outstanding voting securities of any
member of the Contributed Company Group, or (c) merger, consolidation, business
combination, sale of any of the assets, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving any member of the Contributed
Company Group, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, other
than actions directly relating to the Contributed Company Group, the Group
Assets or the Group Business, neither STI nor SSI shall be restricted or limited
in any way from entering into discussions, negotiations or agreements of any
kind or from taking any other actions of any kind, including, without
limitation, transactions relating to the sale of any of its or its direct or
indirect subsidiaries (other than any member(s) of the Contributed Company
Group), equity securities (other than the Contributed Stock), or assets (other
than Group Assets), or the merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving STI,

              (b)  In addition to the obligations set forth in Section
4.11(a), SSI and STI, as promptly as practicable, shall advise VERITAS orally
and in writing of any Contributed Group Alternative Proposal or of any request
for non-public information which SSI reasonably believes would lead to a
Contributed Group Alternative Proposal, or of any Contributed Group Alternative
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request or Contributed Group

        5.5  Letter of VERITAS' Accountants.  VERITAS shall use its reasonable
             ------------------------------
best efforts to cause to be delivered to STI and SSI a letter of Ernst & Young
LLP, dated a date within two business days before the date on which the Form S-4

        5.6  Prospectus/Proxy Statement.  VERITAS will mail to its stockholders
             --------------------------
in a timely manner, for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Merger
and the Seagate Transaction at the VERITAS Stockholders Meeting, the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement in the Form S-4. VERITAS and Newco will prepare and
file the Prospectus/Proxy Statement with the SEC as promptly as practicable, and
each will use its respective best reasonable efforts to cause the Form S-4 to
become effective as soon after such filing as practicable. In this regard,
VERITAS and Newco will advise STI and SSI promptly as to the time at which the

material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading
or necessary to correct any statement which has become false or misleading in
any earlier communication with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the
VERITAS Stockholder Meeting. From and after the date the Form S-4 becomes
effective and until the Effective Time, if any event known to VERITAS or Newco
occurs as a result of which the Prospectus/Proxy Statement would include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
if it is necessary at any time to amend the Form S-4 or the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement to comply with the Securities Act, VERITAS and Newco will promptly
notify STI and SSI and will prepare an amended or supplemented Form S-4 or
Prospectus/Proxy Statement which will correct such statement or omission and
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such amendment to become
effective as promptly as possible. The Prospectus/Proxy Statement, as it relates
to VERITAS and Newco, will comply as to form in all material respects with the

reasonably requested, including, without limitation, the right to examine all
working papers pertaining to all Tax returns and financial statements prepared

        5.14  Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent.  VERITAS and Newco will each

use its respective reasonable best efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied
all the conditions precedent that are set forth in Section 7 and to cause the
Merger and the Seagate Transaction and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to be consummated. Without limiting the foregoing, in connection
with the agreements to be reached by the parties after the date hereof and prior
to the Effective Time, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to reach
agreement on all matters to be included in such agreements promptly after the

        5.15  Voting Agreement.  VERITAS will use its reasonable efforts to
              ----------------
obtain Voting Agreements in the form attached as Exhibit 5.15A (the "VOTING
                                                 -------------        
AGREEMENT"), executed by the VERITAS affiliates listed on Exhibit 5.15B.

        5.16  Group Employee Plans and Benefit Arrangements.
              ---------------------------------------------

              (a)  Newco will adopt the VERITAS Benefit Arrangements and
VERITAS Employee Plans and will use reasonable efforts to provide the VERITAS
Benefit Arrangements and VERITAS Employee Plans to the transferring Employees as
is provided to VERITAS' employees who are similarly situated as soon as
practicable. To the extent that Newco does not have VERITAS Benefit Arrangements
and VERITAS Employee Plans in effect in a jurisdiction where there are
transferring Employees, Newco shall adopt plans providing comparable benefits to
the Group Employee plans for said transferring Employees. From and after the
Effective Time Newco shall provide all transferring Employees with the
opportunity to participate in any employee stock option or other incentive
compensation plan of Newco and its affiliates on substantially the same terms
and subject to substantially the same conditions as are available to similarly
situated employees of VERITAS or Newco including beginning a new offering period
as soon as possible following the Effective Time if necessary to permit
transferring Employees to participate in Newco's employee stock purchase plan.
Prior to the Effective Time, VERITAS, Newco and SSI shall mutually agree 

                                      -53-
<PAGE>
 
upon an integration plan relating to the Merger and the Seagate Transaction
which shall include, among other things, provisions relating to compensation and

hereto as Exhibit 5.16) with the Key Employees who are the Employees and with
key employees of VERITAS listed on Schedule 14.15E-2 hereof.
                                   -----------------

              (b)  Waiting Periods, Premiums and Deductibles.  Newco shall take 
                   -----------------------------------------            
all steps necessary to cause each VERITAS Benefit Arrangement and each VERITAS
Employee Plan to waive any "waiting period" or other requirement with respect to
duration of employment with Newco which would prevent a transferring Employee or
beneficiary thereof who is otherwise eligible to participate in such VERITAS
Employee Plan and VERITAS Benefit Arrangement from participating in such VERITAS
Employee Plan and VERITAS Benefit Arrangement immediately following the
Effective Time. Newco shall pro rate any portion of a premium or deductible with
respect to a VERITAS Employee Plan and VERITAS Benefit Arrangement for any
transferring Employee or beneficiary thereof for any plan year that commenced
prior to the Effective Time.

              (c)  Recognition of Prior Service.  Newco shall take all steps 
                   ----------------------------
necessary to cause each VERITAS Employee Plan and VERITAS Benefit Arrangement
to recognize each transferring Employee's length of service under comparable
employee benefit plans maintained by Seagate for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and benefit accrual in such VERITAS Employee Plan and
VERITAS Benefit Arrangement as if such transferring Employee had been employed
by Newco for such period.

              (d)  Waiver of Restrictions.  Newco shall take all steps 
                   ----------------------                                   
necessary to cause each VERITAS Employee Plan which is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" under Section 3(1) of ERISA to waive any restrictions or
limitations with respect to "pre-existing conditions" or prior medical history
which would apply to transferring Employee or beneficiary thereof who is
otherwise eligible to participate in such VERITAS Employee Plan and VERITAS
Benefit Arrangement from participating in such plan or arrangement without
restriction or limitation.

        5.17  Indemnification and Insurance-VERITAS.
              -------------------------------------

              (a)  The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Newco and
VERITAS shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and
limitation of liability for monetary damages set forth in the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of VERITAS on the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of
ten years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors,
officers, employees or agents of VERITAS, unless such modification is required
by law.

              (b)  From and after the Effective Time, Newco and VERITAS shall
honor, in all respects, all of the indemnity agreements entered into prior to
the date hereof by VERITAS, with its respective officers and directors, whether
or not such persons continue in their positions with Newco or VERITAS following
the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, VERITAS' form of
indemnification agreement shall be adopted as the form of indemnification
agreement for Newco 

                                      -54-
<PAGE>
 
and the VERITAS Surviving Corporation shall be afforded the opportunity to enter
into such indemnification agreement, and shall be covered by such directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies as Newco shall have in effect from time
to time.

                (c)  After the Effective Time, Newco and VERITAS will, jointly
and severally, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify
and hold harmless, each present and former director or officer of VERITAS or any
of its subsidiaries (collectively, for purposes of this Section 5.17(c), the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against any costs or expenses (including attorneys'
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal administrative or investigative, to the
extent arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in his or her
capacity as a director or officer of VERITAS arising out of or pertaining to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby for a period of six years after the date hereof. In the event of any such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or
after the Effective Time), (a) any counsel retained for the defense of the
Indemnified Parties for any period after the Effective Time will be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties, (b) after the Effective Time, VERITAS
will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, promptly after
statements therefor are received, and (c) VERITAS will cooperate in the defense
of any such matter; provided, however, that VERITAS will not be liable for any
settlement effected without its written consent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld); and provided, further, that, in the event that any claim
or claims for indemnification are asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims will
continue until the disposition of any and all such claims. The Indemnified
Parties as a group may be defended by only one law firm (in addition to local
counsel) with respect to any single action, unless there is, under applicable
standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant issue between
the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties.

                (d)  For the entire period from and after the Effective Time
until at least six years after the Effective Time, Newco will cause VERITAS to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in effect directors' and
officers' liability insurance covering those persons who are currently covered
by VERITAS' directors' and officers' liability insurance policy (a copy of which
has been heretofore delivered or made available to Seagate) of at least the same
coverage and amounts, containing terms that are no less advantageous with
respect to claims arising at or before the Effective Time than VERITAS' policies
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time to those applicable to the
then current directors and officers of Newco and VERITAS; provided, however,
that in no event shall Newco or VERITAS be required to expend in excess of 150%
of the annual premium currently paid by VERITAS for such coverage in which event
Newco shall purchase such coverage as is available for such 150% of such annual
premium.

                (e)  Newco and VERITAS shall pay all expenses, including

portion of its properties or assets to any person or entity, then, and in each
such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section
5.17(f), proper provision shall be made so that the successors and the assigns
of Newco and VERITAS assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.17.

              (g)  The provisions of this Section 5.17 shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each officer and director of VERITAS STI, SSI and the
Contributed Company Group described in Sections 5.17 and his or her heirs and

        5.18  Indemnification and Insurance-Employees.
              ---------------------------------------

              (a)  The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of Newco shall
contain the provisions with respect to indemnification and limitation of
liability for monetary damages set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of VERITAS on the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of ten years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of individuals who at the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or
agents of (i) the Contributed Companies or (ii) of SSI (A) to the extent
involved in the Group Business and (B) provided they become Employees, officers
or directors ("GROUP PERSONS"), unless such modification is required by law.

              (b)  From and after the Effective Time, Newco shall honor, in
all respects, all of the indemnity agreements entered into prior to the date
hereof by SSI or any member of the Contributed Company Group with any Group
Persons, whether or not such persons continue in their positions with Newco
following the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, VERITAS' form of
indemnification agreement shall be adopted as the form of indemnification
agreement for Newco and all continuing officers and directors of Newco shall be
afforded the opportunity to enter into such indemnification agreement, and shall
be covered by such directors' and officers' liability insurance policies as
Newco shall have in effect from time to time.

              (c)  After the Effective Time, Newco will, jointly and
severally, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, indemnify and
hold harmless, subject to Section 5.18(g), each of the Group Persons against any
costs or expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal
administrative or investigative, to the extent arising out of or pertaining to
any action or omission in his or her capacity as a director or officer of SSI or
any of the Contributed Companies arising out of or pertaining to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement for a period of six years after the
date hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that claims
against the Group Persons shall first be made against any directors' and
officers' liability insurance, if any, then maintained by SSI or any of the
Contributed Companies that provides converge for such Group Persons. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (a) any counsel 

                                      -56-
<PAGE>
 
retained for the defense of the Group Persons for any period after the Effective
Time will be reasonably satisfactory to the Group Persons, (b) after the
Effective Time, Newco will, subject to Section 5.18(g), pay the reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel, promptly after statements therefor are received,
and (c) Newco will cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided,
however, that Newco will not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld); and provided,
further, that, in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification are
asserted or made within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in
respect of any such claim or claims will continue until the disposition of any
and all such claims. The Group Persons as a group may be defended by only one
law firm (in addition to local counsel) with respect to any single action unless
there is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more Group Persons.

              (d)  Newco shall pay all expenses, including attorneys' fees,
that may be incurred by any Group Persons in enforcing the indemnity and other
obligations provided for their benefit in this Section 5.18.

              (e)  In the event Newco or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and
shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties or assets to any person or entity, then, and in each
such case, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Section
5.18, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and the assigns of
Newco assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.18.

              (f)  The provisions of this Section 5.18 shall survive the
Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Group Persons and his or her heirs and
representatives.

              (g)  Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 5.18 to the
contrary, Newco shall not assume and shall have no Liability relating to claims
made by Minority Holders or SSI optionees arising out of the repurchase, sale or
exchange of SSI capital stock or options in connection with the Seagate
Transaction (other than the transactions contemplated by Section 1.3(a)(ii)) or
specifically relating to matters arising out of the IMG business.

              ---------------------------------------------

registration rights on Form S-3 as provided in the Registration Rights
Agreement, which Rights Agreement and Stockholders Agreement shall be executed
by Newco and VERITAS as of the Effective Time.

        5.20  No Other VERITAS Negotiations.
              -----------------------------

              (a)  VERITAS shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries and its and

subsidiaries or any of its or its subsidiaries' officers, directors or employees
or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor or representative retained
by any of them to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or encourage
the submission of any VERITAS Alternative Proposal, (ii) engage in discussions
or negotiations regarding, provide non-public information with respect to, or
take any other action intended, designed or reasonably likely to facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any VERITAS Alternative Proposal, (iii) enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other similar
agreement with any person with respect to any VERITAS Alternative Proposal, or

regulations thereunder) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition, sale or
other disposition purchase of more than 20% of the assets of VERITAS and its
subsidiaries or more than a 35% interest in the total outstanding voting
securities of VERITAS or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any person or "GROUP" (as defined under Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder) beneficially owning 35%
more of the total outstanding voting securities of VERITAS or any merger,
consolidation, business combination, sale of substantially all the assets,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
VERITAS, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided,
however, that no pending acquisition described in the VERITAS Disclosure Letter
and no issuance of VERITAS Common Stock in connection therewith shall be
considered a VERITAS Alternative Proposal.

                (b)  Notwithstanding Section 5.20(a), prior to obtaining the
approval of the stockholders of VERITAS of this Agreement and the Merger by the
requisite vote under applicable law (the "VERITAS STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL"),
VERITAS may in response to an unsolicited bona fide VERITAS Alternative
Proposal, participate in discussions or negotiations with, furnish information
to a third party making such proposal, make or authorize a statement or
recommendation in support of solicitation of such proposal, or accept such
proposal, if all of the following events shall have occurred: (w) such third
party has made a bona fide written proposal to the Board of Directors of VERITAS
to consummate a VERITAS Alternative Proposal which proposal identifies a price
or range of values to be paid for the outstanding securities or assets of
VERITAS and its subsidiaries, (x) if consummated, after consultation with
investment bankers of nationally recognized reputation, such Board of Directors
has determined is reasonably likely to be financially more favorable to the
stockholders of VERITAS than the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (y) such Board of Directors has determined, after consultation with
investment bankers of nationally recognized reputation, that such third party is
financially capable of consummating such VERITAS Alternative Proposal; and (z)

and conditions, including the identity of the person (and, if relevant, its
Affiliates) making such proposal (it being understood that any amendment to the
price, identity or material terms shall require an additional notice).

5.20(a) and (b), VERITAS as promptly as practicable shall advise STI and SSI
orally and in writing of any request for non-public information which VERITAS
reasonably believes would lead to an VERITAS Alternative Proposal or of any
VERITAS Alternative Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request
or VERITAS Alternative Proposal, and the identity of the person making any such
request, VERITAS Alternative Proposal or inquiry. VERITAS will keep STI and SSI
informed in all material respects of the status and details (including material
amendments) of any such request or VERITAS Alternative Proposal.

agreed upon by the parties, which date shall be as soon as practicable after the
VERITAS Stockholders Meeting and, in any event, no later than the third business
day after all conditions to Closing set forth herein shall have been satisfied
or waived, unless another place, time and date is mutually selected by SSI and

        6.2  Exchange of Certificates.
             ------------------------

             (a)  Exchange Agent. ChaseMellon Stockholder Services LLC shall
                  --------------
act as exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger. Promptly after the
Effective Time, Newco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit
of the holders of shares of VERITAS Common Stock being exchanged for Newco
Common Stock pursuant hereto (collectively "NEWCO STOCK RECIPIENTS"), for
exchange in accordance with this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger,
certificates representing the shares of Newco Common Stock (such shares of
Newco Common Stock, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND") issuable
pursuant to this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger, in exchange for
fractional outstanding shares of VERITAS Common Stock.

             (b)  Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the
                  -------------------
Effective Time, Newco shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each of the
Newco Stock Recipients that holds any certificates representing VERITAS Common
Stock being exchanged or converted into Newco Common Stock pursuant hereto
(collectively, the "CERTIFICATES"): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
VERITAS and SSI may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing Newco Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of
Newco Common Stock and cash in lieu of

<PAGE>
 
fractional shares which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger, and the Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Certificates which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of VERITAS
Common Stock do not need to be delivered to the Exchange Agent and, from and
after the Effective Time, such certificates shall be deemed to evidence the
ownership of an equal number of full shares of Newco Common Stock. In the event
of a transfer of ownership of shares of VERITAS Common Stock which is not
registered on the transfer records of VERITAS, a certificate representing the
proper number of shares of Newco Common Stock may be issued to a transferee, if
the Certificate representing such VERITAS Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 6.2 and the Certificate
of Merger, each Certificate shall be deemed, on and after the Effective Time, to
evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of Newco Common Stock into
which such shares of VERITAS Common Stock shall have been so converted. 

        (c) Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates. No
            --------------------------------------------------------
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to Newco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate for VERITAS Common Stock
with respect to any shares of Newco Common Stock represented thereby, until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate or
affidavit of lost certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Newco Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Newco Common Stock, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Newco
Common Stock.

        (d) No Further Ownership Rights. All shares of Newco Common Stock issued
            ---------------------------
upon the surrender for exchange of shares of VERITAS Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger (including any
cash paid pursuant to Section 6.2(c)) shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of VERITAS Common
Stock. After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of VERITAS of the shares of VERITAS Common
Stock, which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to VERITAS for any reason, they
shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Section 6.2 and the
Certificate of Merger.

        (e) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
            ----------------------------
remains undistributed six months after performance by Newco of all of its
obligations hereunder shall be delivered to Newco, upon demand, and any former
stockholders of VERITAS who have not theretofore complied with this Section 6.2
and the Certificate of Merger shall thereafter look only to 

                                      -60-
<PAGE>
 
Newco for payment of their claim for Newco Common Stock, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Newco Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with
respect to Newco Common Stock.

        (f) No Liability. Neither the Exchange Agent, Newco, VERITAS or SSI
            ------------
shall be liable to SSI or any holder of shares of VERITAS Common Stock, or Newco
Common Stock, as the case may be, for any amount delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

        (g) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any
            --------------------------------------
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and the posting of a
reasonable bond therefor, such shares of Newco Common Stock, and any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to Section 6.2(c).

        6.3 Exchange of Exchanged SSI Options. Prior to Closing, Newco shall

become final and non-appealable or June 30, 1999, so long as such party shall,
at its own expense, use its reasonable best efforts to have such injunction
dissolved.

        9.2 Notice of Termination. Any termination of this Agreement under
            ---------------------
Section 9.1 above will be effected by the delivery of notice of the terminating
party to the other party hereto of such termination, specifying the grounds
therefore.

        9.3 No Liability. Except as provided in Section 9.4 below, any
            ------------
termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9 will be without
further obligation or liability upon any party in favor of the other parties
hereto other than the obligations contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement,
which will survive termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that
                                                  --------  -------
nothing herein will relieve any party from liability for any willful breach,
misrepresentation or misconduct in connection with this Agreement.

        9.4  Breakup Fee.
             -----------   

             (a) If this Agreement is terminated by SSI or STI or VERITAS
pursuant to Section 9.1(h) as a result of a VERITAS Stockholder Rejection and
prior to such rejection (i) an Alternative Proposal has not been publicly
announced or otherwise publicly disclosed and not withdrawn, and (ii) no Change
in Board Recommendation has occurred, then VERITAS shall promptly pay SSI and
STI (by wire transfer or cashier's check) a nonrefundable fee equal to the
actual reasonable legal, accounting and printing expenses incurred by STI, SSI,
the Contributing  

                                      -67-
<PAGE>
 
Companies and/or the Contributed Company Group, but not exceeding $5 million,
within three (3) business days following the delivery of an itemized list of
such expenses by SSI and STI.

             (b) If this Agreement is terminated by SSI or STI or VERITAS (i)
pursuant to Section 9.1(h) as a result of a VERITAS Stockholder Rejection after
an Alternative Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise publicly
disclosed and not withdrawn, (ii) pursuant to Sections 9.1(i) or 9.1(j), then
VERITAS shall promptly pay to SSI (by wire transfer or cashier's check) a
nonrefundable fee equal to $50 million within ten (10) days following delivery
of the notice of termination to or by SSI and STI pursuant to Section 9.2.

             (c) VERITAS acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.4 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, none of STI, SSI or NSMG would
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if VERITAS fails to timely pay the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 9.4, and, in order to obtain such payment,
STI or SSI commences a suit which results in a judgment against VERITAS for the
amounts set forth in this Section 9.4 and such judgment is not set aside or
reversed, VERITAS shall pay to STI or SSI their reasonable costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together
with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 9.4 at the prime rate of
CitiBank in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

contained in this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and effect,
regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the parties to this
Agreement, only until the Effective Time or any earlier termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 9 above, whereupon such representations,
warranties and covenants will expire (except for covenants and other provisions
hereof that by their express terms survive for a longer period).

11.     INDEMNIFICATION

        11.1 Indemnification by SSI and STI. SSI and STI agree, notwithstanding
             ------------------------------   
any provision of Section 1.4 hereof to the contrary, to indemnify Newco and
VERITAS against, and to hold Newco and VERITAS harmless from, all Loss arising
out of any of the following (even if included in the Assumed Liabilities as
otherwise being or allegedly being a Liability of one of the Contributed
Companies or of the Contributed Subsidiaries):

             (a) all Liabilities to Minority Holders or Optionees arising out of
the repurchase, sale or exchange of SSI capital stock or options in connection
with the Seagate Transaction (other than the transactions contemplated by
Section 1.3(a)(ii)) or that arise from rights granted by SSI or STI to any
Employees to require SSI or STI to repurchase shares of SSI capital stock upon
termination of employment.

             (b) any of the Excluded Liabilities, except as may be provided in
Section 13;

                                      -68-
<PAGE>
 
             (c) any demand, claim, debt, suit, cause of action, arbitration,
investigation or other proceeding made or asserted by any Contributing Company
or any stockholder, creditor, or affiliate of any Contributing Company or by any
receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of any Contributing Company of the property or
assets of any Contributing Company, asserting that the transfer of the
Contributed Stock and Assets to Newco hereunder constitutes a fraudulent
conveyance, fraudulent transfer or a preference under any applicable state or
federal law, including but not limited to the United States Bankruptcy Code, or
any breach by any Contributing Company of its representations and covenants in
Section 1.4(e) hereof (the Heading of which is "NO FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCES") or
any Liabilities related to non-compliance with bulk transfer laws in connection
with the Seagate Transaction;

             (d)  IMG; or

             (e) any material Liability omitted from the Group Financial
Statements that was required by GAAP to be included or reflected therein
(collectively, the "OMITTED BALANCE SHEET LIABILITIES"), or any Tax Liability
associated with the Contributed Company Group or the Group Business that STI or
SSI is otherwise responsible for or required to indemnify for under Section 13
and which (i) are not reflected on any line item in the 1998 Group Balance
Sheet; (ii) are not disclosed on Schedule 1.4(b)(i)(B); or (iii) are not
incurred in the Conduct of the Group Business in the ordinary course after the
Group Financial Statements Balance Sheet Date (collectively, the "UNFORESEEN TAX
LIABILITIES"), to the extent the aggregate of such Omitted Balance Sheet
Liabilities and Unforeseen Tax Liabilities exceed $5,000,000 (the "THRESHOLD
AMOUNT"); and, notwithstanding anything in Section 13.4(a)(ii), neither STI nor
SSI shall have any obligation to indemnify Newco under Section 13.4(a)(ii) until
the Threshold Amount is so exceeded; and Newco shall pay any and all of the
Omitted Balance Sheet Liabilities and Unforeseen Tax Liabilities until the
aggregate of such payments of Omitted Balance Sheet Liabilities and Unforeseen
Tax Liabilities equals the Threshold Amount; or

             (f) any breach of the representation in the second sentence of
Section 2.22 hereof (the Heading of which is "Title to and Condition and
                                              --------------------------
Sufficiency of Group Assets").
- ---------------------------

        11.2 Time Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything
             -----------------------------------
herein to the contrary, claims for indemnification under this Section 11 may be
brought after the Closing and at any time prior to the expiration of the legal
statute of limitations applicable to the subject matter of the claim underlying
the claim for indemnification; provided that any claims under Section 11.1(e) or
under Section 11.1(f) must be noticed within 60 days after conclusion of the
first audit of Newco financial results following the Closing that includes the
combined financial results of the Group Business and VERITAS (and in any event
within twelve (12) months after the closing). To preserve a claim for
indemnification under this Section 11, an Indemnified Party need only provide
written notice in reasonable detail of such claim to SSI prior to the expiration
of the applicable time limit (if any) described in the preceding sentence; and
if an Indemnified Party provides such notice prior to the expiration of such
time limit, such Indemnified Party may pursue such claim for indemnification
after the expiration of such time limit.

        11.3 No Limitation on Other Rights. The foregoing indemnification
             -----------------------------
provisions are in addition to, and not in derogation of, any statutory,
equitable or common law remedies that Newco or any other Indemnified Party may
have.

12.     EMPLOYEE MATTERS

        12.1  Right to Offer Employment.
              -------------------------

              (a) Employees. Schedule 12.1 of the SSI Disclosure Letter contains
                  ---------  -------------
a preliminary list (the "PRELIMINARY LIST") of each Contributed Company employee
or consultant and each other employee or consultant of SSI, STI or the Group
Business who works in, or provides services in connection with, the Group
Business or any of the Group Assets (each an "EMPLOYEE"). Within twenty (20)
days prior to the Effective Time, SSI shall deliver to Newco a final list of the
Employees (the "FINAL LIST"), which list shall identify those Employees who are
active Employees of the Group Business as of that date, including those on
vacation, sick leave, disability leave, family leave or personal leave of
absence or who work full or part time, and which shall separately identify those
Employees who are on a workers' compensation-related or disability leave. The
Final List shall contain, with respect to each Employee, a true and accurate
list of all locations at which Employees are working as of the date hereof,
together with the date of hire, location of employment, years of employment or
service, current annual base salary or base wage, and of all other compensation
arrangements for such Employees, including bonuses or other compensation
arrangements. For purposes of this Agreement, "EMPLOYEES" means only those
individuals (whether employees or consultants) included on such final list.

              (b) Offers of Employment. Effective at the Effective Time, Newco
                  --------------------
shall offer to employ Employees on an "at-will" basis and subject to Newco's
standard terms, conditions and policies of employment and the terms of this
Agreement, and shall offer Employees (i) salary consistent with the salary
earned by such Employees prior to the Effective Time but only to the extent such
salary is not in excess of industry norms (ii) participation in incentive
compensation arrangements, subject to Section 5.16 and consistent with the
incentive compensation arrangements of employees of VERITAS in comparable
positions. This Section 12.1(b) shall not be construed to create any third party
Beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any Employee and no
Employee shall have any cause of action as a third party beneficiary. Such
offers of employment that will be extended by Newco to Employees will be on the
same basis of time commitment (full or part time) as such Employee was employed
by immediately prior to the Effective Time. Unless the parties otherwise agree,
on the Closing Date, SSI and STI shall notify each Employee who accepts an offer
of employment extended by Newco as of the Effective Time, in a writing
reasonably satisfactory to Newco, that such Employee's employment with STI or
any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries is then terminated. Neither SSI or
STI may make offer of employment to any Employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, SSI or STI may make offers of employment to Employees at the Scotts
Valley location other than the Oracle Developers; provided, however, that SSI or
STI may make offers of employment to the Oracle Developers if Newco changes
their place of employment from Scotts Valley, California.

                                      -70-

                  ------------------
responsible for any severance, any Liability arising out of failure to give
requisite notice to any non-U.S. Employee or non-U.S. governmental agencies
regarding possible employment transitions to Newco of certain employees or any
other Liability arising out of the employment by Newco of, or the failure of
Newco to employ any non-U.S. Employee.

        12.2  Termination of Employment.
              -------------------------

              (a) SSI and STI agree to comply with the provisions of the WARN
Act and any other federal, state or local statute or regulation regarding
termination of employment, plant closing or layoffs and to perform all
obligations required by SSI and/or STI with respect to the cessation of any
operations of the Group Business or any other business of SSI and/or STI or
their subsidiaries, or the termination, re-assignment, re-location or change in
position of any Employee (or other employee of them) who does not accept Newco's
offer of employment.

              (b) SSI and/or STI shall (i) provide continuation health care
coverage to all Employees and their qualified beneficiaries who incur a
qualifying event or prior to the Effective Time or who do not accept Newco's
offer of employment pursuant to Section 12.1(b) or in accordance with the
continuation health care coverage requirements of COBRA and (ii) provide COBRA
continuation coverage to any former employee of Contributed Company Group who
was previously employed in the Group Business (collectively, the "FORMER
EMPLOYEES") and their qualified beneficiaries to whom, at the Effective Time,
such continuation coverage was provided or to whom SSI and STI are under an
obligation to provide such continuation coverage at the election of such Former
Employee or qualified beneficiary.

        12.3 Cooperation. SSI and STI, VERITAS and Newco agree, for themselves
             -----------
and their affected subsidiaries, to cooperate fully with respect to the actions
which are necessary or reasonably desirable to accomplish the transactions
contemplated hereunder, including, without limitation, the provision of records
and information as each may reasonably request and the making of all appropriate
filings under ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code.

13.     TAX MATTERS

        13.1 Transaction Taxes; Representation; Transaction Tax Indemnity.
             ------------------------------------------------------------
Seagate and Newco shall each bear half of the first $1,000,000 of Transaction
Taxes (as defined below). Thereafter, Seagate shall be solely responsible for
any and all sales, use, excise, value added, registration, stamp, property,
documentary, transfer, withholding and similar taxes and levies, (including all
real estate transfer taxes, but not any real estate transfer taxes that would be
triggered as a result of a change in control of a corporation) incurred, or that
may be payable to any taxing authority, with respect to the sale, transfer, or
delivery of the Contributed Stock and Assets and the assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities, including any sales or use tax imposed on Newco pursuant to Section
6812 of the California Revenue and Taxation Code (collectively, "TRANSACTION
TAXES"). Newco and Seagate agree to cooperate in minimizing the amount of any
such Taxes and in the filing of all necessary documentation and all Tax returns,
reports and forms ("RETURNS") with respect to all such Taxes, including any
available pre-sale filing procedures.

        13.2 No Limitation. Except as provided in Section 11, there shall be no
             -------------
limitation on the amount of a party's liability with respect to its
indemnification obligations under Section 13, and an indemnified party may
assert any such indemnity claim at any time prior to expiration of the
applicable Tax statutes of limitations applicable to the subject matter of the
claim underlying the claim for indemnification under applicable law (including
extensions).

        13.3 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. All payments made by Seagate or
             -------------------------------
Newco, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the other party pursuant to
any indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be treated for Tax
purposes as adjustments to the value of the Contributed Stock and Contributed
Assets, as capital contributions, or as appropriate, the satisfaction of a
preexisting obligation and such treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement, unless there is a final determination as defined in Section 1313(a)
of the Code to the contrary.

        13.4  Indemnity for Taxes.
              -------------------

              (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 13 or Section 11,
from and after the Closing, SSI and STI shall timely pay and indemnify and save
Newco and its Affiliates harmless from any liability for, or arising out of or
based upon, or relating to any Tax (including, without limitation, any
obligation to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a consolidated
basis with respect to a group of corporations that includes or included STI or
SSI) (i) of STI or SSI or any member of the affiliated group of corporations (as
defined in section 1504 of the Code) of which STI or SSI is a member (other than
any member of the Contributed Company Group or with respect to any Tax relating
to the income, business, assets, property or operations of the Group Business)
for any taxable period or (ii) relating to the income, business, assets,
property or operations of the Group Business or of the Contributed Company Group
to the extent that such liability for Tax is not reflected in the SSI Disclosure
Letter or the Group Financial Statements (irrespective of where it is reflected
on the Group Financial Statements Balance Sheet), and is either (A) in respect
of any taxable period that ends prior to the Group Financial Statements Balance
Sheet Date or in respect of any taxable period that includes, but does not end
on, the Group Financial Statements Balance Sheet Date, the portion of such
period ending on the Group Financial Statements Balance Sheet Date or (B) with
respect to an excess loss account in the stock of any Contributed Company or
from a deferred intercompany transaction (other than among members of the
Contributed Company Group) entered into prior to the Group Financial Statements
Balance Sheet Date and is triggered as a result of the Contributed Company Group
ceasing to be affiliated with STI or SSI. The indemnity provisions of this
Section 13.4(a) shall not apply to Taxes attributable to a breach of, or
inaccuracy in, Section 13.6(a).

        (b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 13, STI and SSI
shall not be obligated to indemnify Newco for any Tax (including, without
limitation, any obligation to contribute to the payment of a Tax determined on a
consolidated basis with respect to a group of corporations that includes or
included STI or SSI) by reason of an election or deemed election (including any
protective election) with respect to transactions described in this Agreement
made or filed post-Closing by Newco or any member of the Contributed Companies
under Section 338 of the 

                                      -72-
<PAGE>
 
Internal Revenue Code. Further, no such election shall be made with respect to
any of the transactions described in this Agreement.

        (c) Except to the extent otherwise provided in this Section 13, Newco
shall timely pay and indemnify and save STI and its Affiliates harmless from any
liability for, or arising out of or based upon or relating to any Tax
(including, without limitation, any obligation to contribute to the payment of a
Tax determined on a consolidated basis with respect to a group of corporations
that includes or included STI or SSI) (i) relating to the income, business,
assets, property or operations of the Group Business by Newco and its Affiliate
in respect of all taxable periods beginning after the Group Financial Statements
Balance Sheet Date, or, in the case of any taxable period that includes but does
not end on the Group Financial Statements Balance Sheet Date, the portion of
such period commencing on the day following the Group Financial Statements
Balance Sheet Date; and (ii) to the extent such liability for Tax is reflected
in the Group Financial Statements (irrespective of where it is reflected on the
Group Financial Statements Balance Sheet) or the SSI Disclosure Letter and such
liability is for Tax relating to the income, business, assets, property or
operations of the Group Business or of any member of the Contributed Company.

        13.5  Other Tax Matters.
              -----------------

              (a) Seagate and Newco will cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the preparation of all returns and reports of Taxes, information
returns, and all audit examinations of, or claims or assertions against, any
member of the Contributed Company Group, in each case including but not limited
to the furnishing or making available of records, books of account or other
materials and appropriate personnel necessary or helpful to the defense against
the assertions of any taxing authority. Seagate shall, within a reasonable time
after the Closing Date but no later than 60 days prior to the deadline
(including extensions) of any Tax return of Newco or its Affiliates that
includes the operations of the Group Business or the Contributed Company Group,
use its best efforts to deliver to Newco a schedule listing the tax basis of
each of the Group Assets and the Contributed Stock.

              (b) Except as provided in Section 13.5(c), in the event and to the
extent that STI or any member of an affiliated group of corporations (as defined
in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code) of which STI is a member (other
than any member of the Contributed Company Group) receives a refund or credit of
Taxes for any taxable period that ends prior to the Closing Date or in respect
of any period that includes, but does not end on, the Effective Time, the
portion of such period ending on the Effective Time (the "PRE-CLOSING PERIOD")
which is attributable to the carry back of losses, credits or similar items from
any Tax return of any member of the Contributed Company Group, and in any case,
in respect of any taxable period that begins after the Effective Time or in
respect of any period that includes, but does not end on the Effective Time, the
portion of such period commencing on the day following the Effective Time (the
"Post-Closing Period"), STI shall pay to Newco, net of any additional Tax
payable by STI or its Affiliates by reason of such carryback, the amount of such
refund or credit (including any interest received thereon) or Tax reduction. In
the event that any refund or credit of Taxes or Tax reductions for which a
payment has been made pursuant to this Section 13.5 subsequently is reduced or
disallowed, the Contributed 

                                      -73-
<PAGE>
 
Companies and Newco shall indemnify and hold harmless STI and its Affiliates for
any Tax liability, including interest and penalties, assessed by reason of such
reduction or disallowance.

              (c) In the event that an indemnified party receives a refund or
credit of Taxes for which it has been indemnified pursuant to Section 13.4 of
this Agreement, such indemnified party agrees to pay to the indemnifying party
the amount of such refund or credit (including any interest received thereon).
In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been
made pursuant to this Section 13.5(c) subsequently is reduced or disallowed, the
indemnifying party shall indemnify and hold harmless the indemnified party for
any Tax liability, including interest and penalties, assessed by reason of such
reduction or disallowance.

              (d) If any claim for Tax relating to the Group Business or the
Contributed Company Group is asserted against STI or SSI or any Affiliate for
any Pre-Closing Period, STI shall promptly notify Newco in writing of such fact.
STI, SSI and their duly appointed representatives shall have the sole right to
negotiate, resolve, settle or contest any such claim for Tax; provided, however,
that they shall deal fairly and in good faith with respect to any claim for Tax
which would require a payment by Newco to STI or its affiliates under Section
13.4(c) and provided further, that with respect to any claim which would require
a payment by Newco or have a Material Adverse Effect on the Group Business, no
settlement will be agreed to without Newco's prior written consent. Such consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Newco fails to provide STI with written
consent within 30 days of a written request from STI, and submits a written
objection the procedures in Section 7(c) of the Tax Allocation Agreement dated
as of April 4, 1996 (the "TAX ALLOCATION AGREEMENT") shall be applied. Newco
shall bear the legal and accounting costs and expenses incurred in contesting a
matter for which it has withheld its consent. If any claim for Tax relating to
the Contributed Company Group for any Post-Closing Period comes to the attention
of STI, STI will notify Newco promptly of such claims and will cooperate fully
with Newco and the Contributed Company Group in the resolution of such claim. A
failure to promptly notify pursuant to this Section 13.6(d) shall not preclude
another party's indemnification obligation.

              (e) STI shall prepare any Tax returns (including any amendments
thereto) of the members of the Contributed Company Group for all taxable periods
that end, with respect to the Contributed Company Group, on or before the
Effective Time (including any short period ending on the Closing Date) and which
are due either before or after the Effective Time and shall deliver to Newco for
signing by the appropriate party and filing, any Tax returns of the members of
the Contributed Company Group (including any amendments thereto) with respect to
any such period that have not been filed prior to the Effective Time. STI shall
deliver any such tax return or the portion thereof relating to the Group
Business to Newco at least fifteen days prior to the date such tax return is due
to be filed (taking into account any applicable extensions). STI shall report
for federal income tax purposes the operations of the Group Business and the
Contributed Company Group for any short period ending on the Effective Time, and
shall be responsible for the filing of, the consolidated tax returns of STI's
consolidated group which will include the income of the Group Business and the
Contributed Company Group through the Effective Time and Newco will pay to STI
any amounts relating to such tax returns required by Section 13.4(c) prior to
the filing of such tax returns. In order appropriately to apportion any taxes
relating to a period that includes (but that 

                                      -74-
<PAGE>
 
would not, but for this Section 13.5(e) end on the Effective Time), the parties
hereto will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, elect with the relevant
taxing authority to treat for all purposes the Effective Time as the last day of
a taxable period of any member of the Contributed Company Group. STI shall, in
respect of such returns, and Newco and the Contributed Company Group for returns
with respect to the Post-Closing Period shall determine the income, gain,
expenses, losses, deductions and credits of the Group Business and the
Contributed Company Group in a manner (i) consistent with prior practice and
actual operations in a manner that apportions such income, gain, expenses, loss,
deductions and credits equitably from period to period and (ii) consistent with
prior years. STI and SSI shall not pay a "FSC" commission with respect to the
Group Business without the prior written consent of Newco.

              (f) The tax returns described in Section 13.5(e) shall be prepared
in accordance with the Tax Allocation Agreement except to the extent it is
inconsistent with Section 13.5(e). In addition, the parties agree that for the
taxable periods the Contributed Companies are included in a consolidated return
with STI or SSI, the parties will compensate each other for the use of losses
and credits in the amounts determined in accordance with the Tax Allocation
Agreement. The provisions of this Section 13 with respect to the consolidated
groups or consolidated returns that include STI or SSI or their affiliates other
than a Contributed Company shall apply mutatis mutandis with respect to combined
                                       ----------------
or unitary groups or returns thereof.

              (g) Newco, STI and SSI shall make payments of estimated taxes
(including amounts due with extensions) for which they are responsible under
this agreement in accordance with the Tax Allocation Agreement. Any Tax which is
due (including estimated Taxes) on or prior to the Effective Time and which is
the responsibility of Newco, shall, in lieu of requiring a payment by Newco
prior to the Effective Time, be satisfied by a payment out of the Group Assets
or the Group Business or after payment of such Tax by STI or SSI through an
increase in the account balances owed by the Group Business or the Contributed
Companies to STI or SSI, which increase in the obligation will be satisfied by
Newco subsequent to the Closing. A payment or indemnity obligation under this
section 13 which is not made or satisfied when due shall accrue interest at the
rate of 6% compounded daily. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13 to the
contrary, a party shall not have to bear the cost of a Tax liability more than
once (e.g. a payment of an estimated tax shall be credited against any payment
due when the return is filed).

              (h) Except as provided in paragraph 13.5(e), for purposes of
allocating a Tax for which a party is otherwise responsible under Section 13.4,
the portion of those Taxes that are attributable to the operations of the Group
Business or of any member of the Contributed Company Group for a relevant period
(the "INTERIM PERIOD") shall be (i) in the case of a Tax that is not based on a
net income, the total amount of such Tax for the Interim Period in question
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Interim Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in such
period, and (ii) in the case of a Tax that is based on net income, the Tax that
is due shall be an amount as equitably determined by the parties based upon a
hypothetical closing of the books.

                                      -75-
<PAGE>
 
              (i) If Newco, a Contributed Company or any Affiliate receives any
notice of the assertion of any Tax liability relating to a member of the
Contributed Company Group for which STI or SSI may be liable under this
Agreement, Newco shall give prompt written notice thereof to STI or SSI. A
failure to promptly notify pursuant to this paragraph shall not preclude another
party's indemnification obligation.

              (j) After the Closing, Newco and the Contributed Companies will
provide reasonable access to all relevant Newco and the Contributed Company
Group relevant books, records, agreements and memoranda, and provide such
assistance to STI and SSI as STI, SSI and their Affiliates shall reasonably
request, with respect to any federal, foreign, state or local Tax matters
pertaining to the members of the Contributed Company Group for taxable periods
or transactions on or prior to the Effective Time. Newco will notify STI prior
to disposition of such Tax records, if such disposition will take place within
ten years after the Effective Time.

              (k) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
STI and Newco covenant and agree, (unless there has been a final determination
as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any other event which conclusively
establishes a contrary position) for all Tax purposes including all Tax Returns
and any Tax examinations, proceedings or controversies, to (and to cause any
affiliate or successor to their assets or businesses to) take each of the
positions set forth below (and not to take any position inconsistent therewith)
and to use good faith and reasonable best efforts to defend such positions:

                  (i) The Merger (i) will qualify as a tax-free reorganization
described in Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) when taken together with the
Seagate Transaction, will qualify as a tax-free transfer of the stock of VERITAS
to Newco governed by Section 351(a) of the Code.

                  (ii) The Seagate Transaction, when taken together with Merger,
will qualify as a transfer of the Contributed Stock and Contributed Assets to
Newco governed by Section 351(a) of the Code.

                  (iii) None of the consideration issued in connection with the
Seagate Transaction will be paid or issued for services or as a covenant not to
compete.

              (l) STI and Newco agree to report to the other any communication
from or with the Internal Revenue Service or any other Taxing Authority which
relates in any way to the characterization of the transactions governed by this
Agreement. Each of STI and Newco will file with its Federal income tax return
for the taxable year in which the Merger and Seagate Transaction occurs (which
tax return shall be timely filed) the information required by Treas. Reg. (S)
1.351-3 and 1.368-3 and to provide each other upon request with a statement to
the effect that such party has complied with this requirement after filing. STI,
the Contributed Companies, and Newco also will maintain such permanent records
as are required by Treas. Reg. (S)(S) 1.351-3(c) and 1.368-3.

  13.6 Seagate Transaction Items.
       -------------------------

       (a)  Newco AND VERITAS covenant and represent that:

            (i)    Newco and VERITAS have no plan or intention to permit or to
cause VERITAS or any Contributed Company to be liquidated or to be merged with
any other entity.

            (ii)   Newco and VERITAS have no plan or intention to terminate the
existence of Newco, VERITAS or any Contributed Company (including without
limitation by Merger).

            (iii)  Newco and VERITAS have no plan or intention to cause or
permit Newco to dispose of all or any portion of the stock of VERITAS or of any
Contributed Company (including, without limitation, by merger) or the
Contributed Assets, except in the ordinary course of business.

            (iv)   After taking into account (and thus deeming shares to be
issued as of the end on the Closing Date) any planned or intended (as of the
date hereof and the Effective Time) issuances of Newco stock and the exercise of
any Newco stock rights (including warrants, options, convertible instruments),
the shareholders of VERITAS immediately prior to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and Seagate (collectively, the "transferees") shall hold on
the day after the Effective Time at least 80% of the voting stock of Newco and
at least 80% of each class of non-voting stock of Newco. This representation
shall be deemed made twice, assuming in the alternative that the VERITAS shares
held by Seagate are (A) voting stock and (B) non-voting stock.

            (v)    Other than the possible repurchase of employee shares as a
result of an obligation of SSI that may be assumed by Newco, VERITAS and Newco
have no plan or intention to redeem or otherwise reacquire any stock to be
issued in the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

            (vi)   VERITAS and Newco are not aware of any plan or intent on the
part of the officers, directors and 5% or greater shareholders of VERITAS to
dispose of any Newco shares issued in the merger in a transaction undertaken in
connection with this transaction.

            (vii)  VERITAS and Newco are not "investment companies" within the
meaning of 351(e) of the Code and section 1.351-1(c)(1)(ii) of the regulations
promulgated thereunder.

            (viii) With respect to matters not covered by Section 13.6(a)(i)
through 13.6(a)(vii), Newco shall not take, or permit its affiliates to take,
any action within two years of the Effective Time which it (or its advisors
actually participating or advising in the action) actually know (at the time of
such action) will preclude the ability of the Seagate transaction to qualify as
a tax-free exchange under section 351(a) of the Code. 

                                      -77-
<PAGE>
 
             (ix) VERITAS and Newco shall make such additional representations
and covenants as SSI or its counsel shall reasonably request prior to the
closing for purposes of establishing the qualification under Section 351 of the
Seagate Transaction, provided such representations and covenants are in a form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to VERITAS and Newco. Any such
representations shall be considered to be part of this section 13.6(a).

        (b) The representations and covenants of this Section 13.6(a) shall
survive the Closing of the Seagate Transaction through the expiration of the
applicable Tax statutes of limitations (including extensions).

14.     MISCELLANEOUS

        14.1 Governing Law. The internal laws of the State of California
             -------------
(irrespective of its choice of law principles) will govern the validity of this
Agreement, the construction of its terms and the interpretation and enforcement
of the rights and duties of the parties hereto, except that the fiduciary duties
of the directors and managers of parties hereto and their affiliates shall be
governed by the law of the jurisdiction of such company's formation.

        14.2 Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns. None of the
             -----------------------------------------------
parties hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto; provided, however, that the
sale or other transfer of the stock of any Contributing Company shall not be
deemed an assignment provided that this Agreement remains enforceable against
the Contributing Company after such stock sale or transfer. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

        14.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
             ------------
application thereof, will for any reason and to any extent be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement and application of such provision
to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

        14.4 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
             ------------
counterparts, each of which will be an original as regards any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together will constitute one and the
same instrument. This Agreement will become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, will bear the signatures of
all the parties reflected hereon as signatories.

        14.5 Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
             --------------
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law on such party,
and the exercise of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other.
The parties agree that specific performance is an appropriate remedy for a
breach of their respective obligations under this Agreement.

        14.6 Amendment and Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may
             ---------------------
be amended by the parties hereto at anytime by execution of an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of STI, SSI and VERITAS. At any time prior to
the Closing, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively) only by a writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby. The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the
performance hereof will not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other
default or any succeeding breach or default. Delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. The Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto at any time before or after approval of such
party's stockholders, but, after such approval, no amendment will be made which
by applicable law requires the further approval of a party's stockholders
without obtaining such further approval.

        14.7 Expenses. Except as herein expressly provided to the contrary in
             --------
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, each party will bear its respective
fees and expenses incurred with respect to the negotiation, preparation and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, however, that SSI and VERITAS shall share equally all fees and
expenses, other than incurred in connection with the printing and filing of the
Form S-4 (including financial statements and exhibits) and any amendment or
supplements thereto; provided, further that upon Closing of the Merger and the
Seagate Transaction, Newco shall pay 20% of the reasonable attorneys',
accountants' and financial advisors' fees, incurred by SSI and STI in connection
with the Agreement.

        14.8 Attorneys' Fees. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any
             ---------------
part of this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover, as an
element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys' fees to
be fixed by the court (including, without limitation, costs, expenses and fees
on any appeal). The prevailing party will be entitled to recover its costs of
suit, regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.

        14.9 Notices. All notices and other communications pursuant to this
             -------
Agreement shall be in writing and deemed to be sufficient if contained in a
written instrument and shall be deemed given if delivered personally,
