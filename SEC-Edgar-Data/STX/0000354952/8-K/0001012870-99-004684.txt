              ------------

     Seagate Technology, Inc. a Delaware corporation ("Seagate"), has entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Agreement") dated December 3,
1999 with XIOtech Corporation, a Minnesota corporation ("XIOtech") and Trout
Acquisition Corp., a Minnesota corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of
Seagate ("Merger Sub").  Subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement,
Merger Sub will be merged into XIOtech, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease and XIOtech will continue as the surviving corporation as
a wholly owned subsidiary of Seagate.  In the Merger, each share of XIOtech
Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive shares of Seagate
Common Stock, and the outstanding options to purchase shares of XIOtech Common
Stock will be assumed by Seagate and converted into stock options to purchase
shares of Seagate Common Stock.  The aggregate value of the shares of Seagate
Common Stock to be issued for the XIOtech options and outstanding capital stock
will be $360 million.  The Merger will be accounted for as a purchase.  The
Merger has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Seagate, XIOtech and
Merger Sub, but it is still subject to XIOtech shareholder approval and
customary regulatory approvals.

Company and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its

and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the
shareholders of the Company listed on Schedule 6.17 hereto is entering into a
                                      -------------

"Voting Agreement").

     F.   Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to Parent's willingness to enter into this Agreement, the

<PAGE>

          (f) Stock Options.  At the Effective Time, all options to purchase
              -------------
Company Common Stock (each a "Company Option") then outstanding (whether or not
exercisable at such time) under the Company's Amended and Restated 1996 Stock
Option Plan (the "Option Plan") or otherwise, shall remain outstanding following
the Effective Time and shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with provisions
described below.

              (i)   Each Company Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the Option Plan and/or as provided in the respective
option agreement governing such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that (A) such Company Option shall be exercisable for
that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Common Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option shall
be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time by the Common Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent.

              (ii)  In the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of
the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code
("qualified stock option"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable
pursuant to such assumed Parent Common Stock option and the terms and conditions
of exercise of such assumed Parent Common Stock option shall be determined in
order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.

              (iii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
shall deliver to the holders of Company Options appropriate notices setting
forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Option Plan, and the agreements
evidencing the grants of such Company Options shall be deemed to be
appropriately amended so that such Company Options shall represent rights to
acquire Parent Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as contained in the
outstanding Company Options (subject to the adjustments required by this Section
1.6(f) after giving effect to the assumption by Parent as set forth above).
Parent shall comply with the terms of the Company Stock Plan and use good faith
efforts to ensure, to the extent permitted by the Code and to the extent
required by, and subject to the provisions of, the Option Plan, that Company
Options which qualified as qualified stock options prior to the Effective Time
continue to qualify as qualified stock options of Parent after the Effective
Time.

              (iv)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.6, in lieu of assuming outstanding Company Options in accordance with this
Section 1.6(f), Parent may, at its election, cause such outstanding Company
Options to be replaced by issuing substantially similar replacement stock
options in substitution therefor pursuant to a stock option plan of Parent,
which is substantially similar to the Option Plan.

          (g) Common Warrants.  To the extent the warrant to purchase shares of
              ---------------
Company Common Stock (the "Common Warrants") remain exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Common Warrants shall, in connection with the
Merger and pursuant to its terms, be terminated and shall not be assumed by
Parent.  After the Effective Time, any unexercised portion of

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

the Common Warrants shall not represent any right to purchase any Company
Capital Stock or any Parent Common Stock.

          (h) Series A Warrants.  To the extent the warrant to purchase shares
              -----------------
of Series A Preferred (the "Series A Warrants") remain exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time, the Series A Warrants shall, in connection with the
Merger and pursuant to its terms, be terminated and shall not be assumed by
Parent.  After the Effective Time, any unexercised portion of the Series A
Warrants shall not represent any right to purchase any Company Capital Stock or
any Parent Common Stock.

          (i) Capital Stock of Merger Sub.  Each share of common stock of Merger
              ---------------------------
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.  Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall continue
to evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

          (j) Adjustments to Exchange Ratios.  The Per Share Amount shall be
              ------------------------------
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
Parent Common Stock or Company Capital Stock), reorganization, recapitalization
or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Capital
Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

          (k) Fractional Shares.  No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
              -----------------
will be issued at the Effective Time, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares
of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall be entitled to receive from
Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the Average Closing Price.

     1.7  Dissenters' Rights.
          ------------------

          (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected dissenters' rights for such shares in accordance with Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the Minnesota Revised Statutes and who, as of the
Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal or
dissenters' rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or
represent a right to receive Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, but
the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are granted by
Minnesota Law.  From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of a
shareholder of the Surviving Corporation.

          (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1.6(a) and (b) hereof,
if any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such
shares under Minnesota Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holder's shares shall
automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive Parent
Common Stock

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

and fractional shares as provided in Section 1.6(a) or (b), as the case may be,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares.

          (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Minnesota Law and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under
Minnesota Law.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal of capital stock of the Company or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

     1.8  Surrender of Certificates.
          -------------------------

          (a) Exchange Agent.  Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
              --------------
designate Harris Trust Company of California to act as exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

          (b) Parent to Provide Parent Common Stock.  Promptly after the
              -------------------------------------
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange
in accordance with this Article I, the aggregate number of shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock; provided, however, that, on behalf of the holders of
                          --------  -------
Company Capital Stock, and pursuant to Article VIII hereof, Parent shall deposit
into an escrow account a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Escrow Amount out of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock
otherwise issuable pursuant to Section 1.6.  The portion of the Escrow Amount
contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock shall be in
proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock which such
holder would otherwise be entitled to receive under Section 1.6 by virtue of
ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.

          (c) Exchange Procedures.  Promptly after the Effective Time, the
              -------------------
Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock whose
shares were converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be
in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may agree)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock.  Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (less the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder's behalf pursuant to Article
VIII hereof), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.6, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.  On the Effective Time,
and subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII hereof,
Parent shall cause to be distributed to the Escrow Agent (as defined in Article
VIII) a certificate or certificates representing that number of

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount which shall be
registered in the name of the Escrow Agent. As set forth in Section 8.2(c)(iii),
such shares shall be beneficially owned by the holders on whose behalf such
shares were deposited in the Escrow Fund and such shares shall be available to
compensate Parent as provided in Article VIII. Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the
ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted and the right to
receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6.

          (d) Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares.  No dividends or
              ------------------------------------------------
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to
the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate
shall surrender such Certificate.  Subject to applicable law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of
the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

          (e) Transfers of Ownership.  If any certificate for shares of Parent
              ----------------------
Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

          (f) No Liability.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
              ------------
Section 1.8, none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

     1.9  No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.  All shares of
          ---------------------------------------------------
Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in
respect thereof) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

     1.10 Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates.  In the event any certificates
evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash for fractional
shares, if any, as

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

may be required pursuant to Section 1.6; provided, however, that Parent may,
                                         --------  -------
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

     1.11 Tax and Accounting Consequences.  It is intended by the parties hereto
          -------------------------------
that the Merger shall (a) constitute a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code (and this Agreement is intended to constitute a plan
of reorganization for purposes of Section 368(a) of the Code) and (b) qualify
for accounting treatment as a "purchase."

     1.12 Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action.  If, at any time after the
          ------------------------------------------
Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the
Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in the name of their respective
corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary
action.

                                 ARTICLE VIII

              SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; ESCROW

     8.1  Survival of Representations and Warranties.  All of the Company's
          ------------------------------------------
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement (each as modified by the Company Schedules) shall
survive the Merger and continue until 5:00 p.m., Minnesota time, on the date
which is one year following the Closing Date (the "Expiration Date"). The
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall not survive the
Effective Time or be of any further force and effect thereafter.

     8.2  Escrow Arrangements and Indemnification.

          (a) Escrow Fund and Indemnification by the Company.  At the Effective
              ----------------------------------------------
Time the Company's shareholders will be deemed to have received and deposited
with the Escrow Agent (as defined below) the Escrow Amount (plus any additional
shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock dividend or recapitalization
effected by Parent after the Effective Time) without any act of any shareholder
pursuant to an Escrow Agreement to be negotiated by the Parent, Company and the
Escrow Agent in a form reasonably satisfactory to them and consistent with this
Article VIII (the "Escrow Agreement").  As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Escrow Amount, without any act of any Company shareholder,
will be deposited by Parent with The Bank of New York (or other institution
acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Agents (as defined in Section 8.2(g)
below)) as Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Agent"), such deposit to constitute an
escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") to be governed by the terms set forth herein and
in the Escrow Agreement.  The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf
of each shareholder of the Company shall be in proportion to the aggregate
Parent Common Stock, which such holder would otherwise be entitled under
Sections 1.6(a) and (b) and shall be in the respective share amounts and
percentages listed on the Closing Date Payment Schedule opposite each Company
shareholder's name.  All shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow
Fund shall not be unvested or subject to any right of repurchase, risk of
forfeiture or other condition in favor of the Surviving Corporation.  The Escrow
Fund shall be available to compensate Parent and its affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses, and expenses of investigation and defense (hereinafter individually a
"Loss" and collectively "Losses") incurred by Parent, its officers, directors,
or affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) directly or indirectly as a
result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty of the
Company contained herein (or in any certificate, instrument, schedule or
document attached to this Agreement and delivered by the Company in connection
with the Merger) or (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with
any covenant contained herein (or in any certificate, instrument, schedule or
document attached to this Agreement and delivered by the Company in connection
with the Merger); provided any such claims must be asserted on or before 5:00
p.m. (Minnesota Time) on the Expiration Date.  Except as

                                     -53-
<PAGE>

otherwise provided herein, Parent may not receive any shares from the Escrow
Fund unless and until Officer's Certificates (as defined in Section 8.2(d)
below) identifying Losses, the aggregate amount of which exceed $500,000, have
been delivered to the Escrow Agent as provided in paragraph (e) and such amount
is determined pursuant to this Article VIII to be payable; in such case, Parent
may recover shares from the Escrow Fund equal in value to all indemnified Losses
(excluding any Losses within the $500,000 threshold) for which there is no
objection or any objection had been resolved in accordance with the provisions
of this Article VIII; provided, however, that to the extent Third Party Expenses
                      --------  -------
(as defined in Section 10.2), incurred by the Company in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger exceed $250,000 in the aggregate, such excess shall be
deemed a Loss for purposes of Article VIII and shall be immediately reimbursable
to Parent in accordance with this Article VIII (without regard to the $500,000
minimum threshold for Losses and without counting toward the $500,000
threshold).

          (b) Escrow Period; Distribution upon Termination of Escrow Periods.
              --------------------------------------------------------------
Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Fund shall be in existence
immediately following the Effective Time and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m.,
Minnesota time, on the Expiration Date (the "Escrow Period"); provided, however,
                                                              --------  -------
that the Escrow Period shall not terminate with respect to such amount (or some
portion thereof), that is necessary in the reasonable judgment of Parent,
subject to the objection of the Securityholder Agents and the subsequent
arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 8.2(f) hereof, to
satisfy any unsatisfied claims concerning facts and circumstances existing prior
to the termination of such Escrow Period specified in any Officer's Certificate
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to termination of such Escrow Period.  As
soon as all such claims have been resolved, as evidenced by written memorandum
of the Securityholder Agents and Parent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the
shareholders of the Company the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund not
required to satisfy such claims.  Deliveries of Escrow Amounts to the
shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2(b) shall be made in
proportion to their respective original contributions to the Escrow Fund (as set
forth on the Closing Date Payment Schedule).  At all times during the Escrow
Period, the Company shareholders shall be deemed to be the record holders of
their respective amounts of the Parent Common Stock comprising the Escrow
Amount.

          (c)  Protection of Escrow Fund.
               -------------------------

                (i)   The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund
during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and not as the property of Parent and shall
hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof.

                (ii)  Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity
securities issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon a stock
split or stock dividend) ("New Shares") in respect of Parent Common Stock in the
Escrow Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be added to
the Escrow Fund and become a part thereof. New Shares issued in respect of
shares of Parent Common Stock which have been released from the Escrow Fund
shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the
recordholders thereof. Cash dividends on Parent Common Stock shall not be added
to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed to the recordholders thereof.

                                     -54-
<PAGE>

                (iii) Each Company shareholder shall be deemed the record holder
of, and shall have voting, dividend, distribution and all other rights with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock contributed to the Escrow Fund by
such shareholder (and on any voting securities and other equity securities added
to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of Parent Common Stock).

          (d)  Claims Upon Escrow Fund.
               -----------------------

                (i)  Upon receipt by the Escrow Agent at any time on or before
the Expiration Date of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an
"Officer's Certificate"): (A) stating that Parent has paid or properly accrued
or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses, and (B)
specifying in reasonable detail the individual items of Losses included in the
amount so stated, the date each such item was paid or properly accrued, or the
basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of the misrepresentation,
breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is related, the Escrow Agent
shall, subject to the provisions of Section 8.2(e) hereof, deliver to Parent out
of the Escrow Fund, as promptly as practicable, shares of Parent Common Stock
held in the Escrow Fund in an amount equal to such Losses.

                (ii) For the purposes of determining the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow Fund pursuant to
Section 8.2(d)(i) hereof, the shares of Parent Common Stock shall be valued at
the Average Closing Price. Parent and the Securityholder Agents shall certify
such determined value in a certificate signed by both Parent and the
Securityholder Agents, and shall deliver such certificate to the Escrow Agent.

          (e)  Objections to Claims.  At the time of delivery of any Officer's
               --------------------
Certificate to the Escrow Agent, Parent shall deliver a duplicate copy of such
certificate to the Securityholder Agents and for a period of thirty (30) days
after such delivery, the Escrow Agent shall not deliver to Parent any Escrow
Amounts pursuant to Section 8.2(d) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Securityholder Agents to make such
delivery.  After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow Agent
shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 8.2(d) hereof, provided that no such payment or delivery
may be made if the Securityholder Agents shall object in a written statement to
the claim made in the Officer's Certificate, and such statement shall have been
delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such thirty (30) day
period.

                                     -55-

          (f)  Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration.
               ------------------------------------

                (i)   In case the Securityholder Agents shall so object in
writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer's Certificate, the
Securityholder Agents and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the
rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the
Securityholder Agents and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth
such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any
such memorandum and distribute shares of Parent Common Stock from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

                (ii)  If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, and in any event not later than sixty (60) days after receipt of
the written objection of the Securityholder Agents, either Parent or the
Securityholder Agents may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of
the damage or loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in
which event arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained
or both parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall
be settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Any such arbitration
shall be held in Hennepin County, Minnesota under the American Arbitration
Association Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect. Parent and the
Securityholder Agents shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators
so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which arbitrators shall be
independent, meaning that they may not be current or former employees or
consultants or the Parent, Merger Sub, Company or Surviving Corporation. The
arbitrators must disclosure any circumstances likely to affect their
independence pursuant to Rule 19 of the American Arbitration Association
Commercial Arbitration Rules. The period of discovery shall be limited to 60
days and limited to relevant information from the opposing parties about the
subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel
or limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law or equity,
should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought without substantial
justification or that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial
justification. The decision of a majority of the three arbitrators as to the
validity and amount of any claim in such Officer's Certificate shall be binding
and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything
in Section 8.2(e) hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in
accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow
Fund in accordance therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the
award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.

                (iii) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be
entered in any court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 8.2(f),
in any arbitration hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in
the Officer's Certificate is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the Non-
Prevailing Party in the event that the arbitrators award Parent the sum of one-
half ( 1/2) or less of the disputed amount plus any amounts not in dispute;
otherwise, the shareholders of the Company as represented by the Securityholder
Agents shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party.  Each party to an
arbitration shall pay its own expenses and one half of (i) the fees of each
arbitrator and (ii) the administrative costs of the arbitration.

          (g) Securityholder Agents of the Shareholders; Power of Attorney.
              ------------------------------------------------------------

               (i)  In the event that the Merger is approved, effective upon
such vote, and without further act of any shareholder, Fredric R. Boswell and
John F. Stapleton shall be appointed as agents and attorneys-in-fact (each such
natural person a "Securityholder Agent" and collectively, the "Securityholder
Agents") for each shareholder of the Company (except such shareholders, if any,
as shall have perfected their dissenters' rights under Minnesota Law), for and
on behalf of shareholders of the Company, to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of shares of Parent Common Stock
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such
deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of,
and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of Securityholder Agents for the accomplishment of
the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the shareholders of the Company
from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Parent; provided that the each of the persons acting as Securityholder Agents
may not be removed unless holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund
agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Any vacancy
in either of the positions of Securityholder Agents may be filled by approval of
the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be
required of the Securityholder Agents, and the Securityholder Agents shall not
receive compensation for their services. The reasonable legal fees and expenses
and other professional fees incurred by the Securityholder Agents in connection
with the performance of such persons' duties hereunder shall be reimbursed from
the Escrow Fund upon written request pursuant to Section 8.2(d) hereof;
provided, however, that such expenses shall be paid from the Escrow Fund after
all allowed claims shall have been paid or sufficient amounts thereof have been
set aside. Notices or communications to or from the Securityholder Agents shall
constitute notice to or from each of the shareholders of the Company.

               (ii) Neither or the Securityholder Agents shall be liable for any
act done or omitted hereunder as Securityholder Agents while acting in good
faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The shareholders of the
Company on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to the Escrow Fund
shall jointly and severally indemnify each of the Securityholder Agents and hold
each of the Securityholder Agents harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the part of such
Securityholder Agent and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Securityholder Agents' duties hereunder, including the
reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Securityholder
Agents.

          (h) Actions of the Securityholder Agents.  A decision, act, consent or
              ------------------------------------
instruction of both of the Securityholder Agents shall constitute a decision of
all the shareholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable
to them are deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon each of such shareholders, and the Escrow Agent and Parent may
rely upon any such written decision, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Agents as being the decision, consent or instruction of each
every such shareholder of the Company.  The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby
relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, consent or instruction of the Securityholder
Agents.

                                     -57-
<PAGE>

          (i)  Third Party Claims.
               ------------------

                (i)   If any third party shall notify Parent or its affiliates
hereto with respect to any matter (hereinafter referred to as a "Third Party
Claim"), which may give rise to a claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund, then
Parent shall give notice to the Securityholder Agents within 30 days of Parent
becoming aware of any such Third Party Claim or of facts upon which any such
Third Party Claim will be based (but in all events, at least five business days
prior to the date that an answer to such Third Party Claim is due to be filed)
setting forth such material information with respect to the Third Party Claim as
is reasonably available to Parent; provided, however, that no delay or failure
                                   --------  -------
on the part of Parent in notifying the Securityholder Agents shall relieve the
Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders from any obligation hereunder
unless the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders are thereby
materially prejudiced (and then solely to the extent of such prejudice). The
Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders shall not be liable for any
attorneys fees and expenses incurred by Parent prior to Parent's giving notice
to the Securityholder Agents of a Third Party Claim. The notice from Parent to
the Securityholder Agents shall set forth such material information with respect
to the Third Party Claim as is then reasonably available to Parent.

                (ii)  In case any Third Party Claim is asserted against Parent
or its affiliates, and Parent notifies the Securityholder Agents thereof
pursuant to Section 8.2(i)(a) hereinabove, the Securityholder Agents and the
Company shareholders will be entitled, if the Securityholder Agents so elect by
written notice delivered to Parent within 30 days after receiving Parent's
notice, to assume the defense thereof, at the expense of the Company
shareholders independent of the Escrow Fund, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, so long as:

                      (A)  Parent has reasonably determined that Losses which
may be incurred as a result of the Third Party Claim do not exceed either
individually, or when aggregated with all other Third Party Claims, the total
dollar value of the Escrow Fund determined in accordance with Section 8.2(d)(ii)
hereof;

                      (B)  the Third Party Claim involves only money damages and
does not seek an injunction or other equitable relief; and

                      (C)  settlement of, or an adverse judgment with respect
to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of Parent, likely
to establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the
continuing business interests of Parent.

     If the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders so assume any
such defense, the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders shall
conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently.  The
Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders shall not compromise or
settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect
thereof without the prior written consent of Parent and/or its affiliates, as
applicable.

                (iii) In the event that the Securityholder Agents assume the
defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 8.2(i)(ii) above,
Parent or its affiliates may retain separate counsel and participate in the
defense of the Third Party Claim, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of Parent unless Parent or its affiliates shall
reasonably

                                     -58-
<PAGE>

determine that there is a material conflict of interest between or among Parent
or its affiliates and the Securityholder Agents and the Company shareholders
with respect to such Third Party Claim, in which case the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel will be borne by the Securityholder Agents and the
Company shareholders out of the Escrow Fund. Parent or its affiliates will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Agents. Parent will cooperate in the defense of the Third Party Claim and will
provide full access to documents, assets, properties, books and records
reasonably requested by Securityholder Agents and material to the claim and will
make available all officers, directors and employees reasonably requested by
Securityholder Agents for investigation, depositions and trial.

          (iv)  In the event that the Securityholder Agents fail or elect not to
assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such Third Party Claim,
which Securityholder Agents had the right to assume under Section 8.2(i)(ii)
above, Parent or its affiliates shall have the right to undertake the defense
and Parent shall not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent to
entry of any judgment in respect thereof without the prior written consent of
Securityholder Agents.  In the event that the Securityholder Agents are not
entitled to assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such Third
Party Claim pursuant to Section 8.2(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates shall
have the right to undertake the defense, consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim in any manner it
may deem appropriate (and Parent or its affiliates need not consult with, or
obtain any consent from, the Securityholder Agents in connection therewith);
provided, however, that except with the written consent of the Securityholder
- --------  -------
Agents, no settlement of any such claim or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to such Third Party Claim shall alone be determinative of the
validity of the claim against the Escrow Fund.  In each case, Parent or its
affiliates shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and
diligently, and the Securityholder Agents will cooperate with Parent or its
affiliates, and will use its best efforts to cause the Company's shareholders,
to cooperate in the defense of that claim and will provide full access to
documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by Parent
and material to the claim and will make available all individuals reasonably
requested by Parent for investigation, depositions and trial.

     (j)  Escrow Agent's Duties.
          ---------------------

           (i) The Escrow Agent shall be obligated only for the performance of
such duties as are specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in any
additional written escrow instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after
the date of this Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the
Securityholder Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or
refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and
to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties.  The Escrow
Agent shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent
while acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith.

           (ii)  The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized to disregard
any and all warnings given by any of the parties hereto or by any other person,
excepting only orders or process of courts of law, and is hereby expressly
authorized to comply with and obey orders,

                                     -59-
<PAGE>

judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies
with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall not
be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason of such
compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to have
been entered without jurisdiction.

           (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable in any respect on
account of the identity, authority or rights of the parties executing or
delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this Agreement or any documents
or papers deposited or called for hereunder.

           (iv)  The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any
rights under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.

           (v)   In performing any duties under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent
shall not be liable to any party for damages, losses, or expenses, except for
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent.  The
Escrow Agent shall not incur any such liability for (A) any act or failure to
act made or omitted in good faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in
reliance upon any written instrument, including any written statement or
affidavit provided for in this Agreement that the Escrow Agent shall in good
faith believe to be genuine, nor will the Escrow Agent be liable or responsible
for forgeries, fraud, impersonations, or determining the scope of any
representative authority.  In addition, the Escrow Agent may consult with the
legal counsel in connection with Escrow Agent's duties under this Agreement and
shall be fully protected in any act taken, suffered, or permitted by him/her in
good faith in accordance with the advice of counsel.  The Escrow Agent is not
responsible for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.

           (vi)  If any controversy arises between the parties to this
Agreement, or with any other party, concerning the subject matter of this
Agreement, its terms or conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to
determine the controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent
may hold all documents and shares of Parent Common Stock and may wait for
settlement of any such controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or
other means as, in the Escrow Agent's discretion, the Escrow Agent may be
required, despite what may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such
event, the Escrow Agent will not be liable for damage. Furthermore, the Escrow
Agent may at its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to
answer and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of
Parent Common Stock held in escrow, except all cost, expenses, charges and
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader
action and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon initiating
such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and discharged of and from
all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of this Agreement.

           (vii)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree jointly and
severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including reasonable costs
of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may be imposed on Escrow
Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of his/her
duties under this Agreement, including but not limited to any litigation arising
from this

                                     -60-
<PAGE>

Agreement or involving its subject matter; provided, however, that in the event
                                           --------  -------
the Securityholder Agents shall be the Non-Prevailing Party in connection with
any claim or action initiated by a Company shareholder or Company shareholders,
then such Company shareholder or Company shareholders shall be responsible for
the indemnification of the Escrow Agent to the full extent provided by this
paragraph.

              (viii)  The Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at
least thirty (30) days written notice to the parties; provided, however, that no
                                                      --------  -------
such resignation shall become effective until the appointment of a successor
escrow agent which shall be accomplished as follows:  the parties shall use
their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent within thirty
(30) days after receiving such notice.  If the parties fail to agree upon a
successor escrow agent within such time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right
to appoint a successor escrow agent authorized to do business in the state of
Minnesota.  The successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument
accepting such appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with
all the estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor
escrow agent as if originally named as escrow agent.  The Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.

          (k) Fees.  All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
              ----
hereunder shall be paid by Parent.  It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be considered
compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this Agreement.  In the
event that the conditions of this Agreement are not promptly fulfilled, or if
the Escrow Agent renders any service not provided for in this Agreement, or if
the parties request a substantial modification of its terms, or if any
controversy arises, or if the Escrow Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in,
any litigation pertaining to this escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent
shall be reasonably compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed
for all costs, attorneys' fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay,
controversy or litigation.  Parent promises to pay these sums upon demand.

          (l) Maximum Liability and Remedies.  Except for fraud, the rights of
              ------------------------------
Parent to make claims upon the Escrow Fund in accordance with this Article VIII
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
after the Closing with respect to any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Company under this Agreement and no former shareholder, option
holder, warrant holder, director, officer, employee or agent of Company shall
have any personal liability to Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing in connection with the Merger.

occurred by February 29, 2000 (or March 31, 2000 if HSR Approval has not been
obtained prior to February 29, 2000) (provided that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this clause 9.1(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose
willful failure to fulfill any obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date
and such action or failure constitutes a breach of this Agreement); (ii) there
shall be a final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in effect
preventing consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any statute,
rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to
the Merger by any Governmental Entity that would make consummation of the Merger
illegal;

          (c)  by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any statute,
rule, regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to
the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which would:  (i) prohibit Parent's or
the Company's ownership or operation of  any portion of the business of the
Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold separate, as
a result of the Merger, any portion of the business or assets of the Company or
Parent;

          (d)  by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the
Company and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section
7.3(a) or 7.3(b), as the case may be, would not then be satisfied; provided,
                                                                   --------
however, that if such breach is curable by the Company within 30 days through
- -------
the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then for so long as the Company
continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts Parent may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(d) unless such breach is not cured within 30
days (but no cure period shall be required for a breach which by its nature
cannot be cured);

          (e)  by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations
under this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in
Section 7.2(a) or 7.2(b), as the case may be, would not then be satisfied;
provided, however, that if such breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub
- --------  -------
within 30 days through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then for so
long as Parent or Merger Sub continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts
the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(e) unless
such breach is not cured within 30 days (but no cure period shall be required
for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured).

     Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1,
it shall be sufficient for such action to be authorized by the Board of
Directors (as applicable) of the party taking such action.

     9.2  Effect of Termination.  Except as set forth in Section 10.2, any
          ---------------------
termination of this Agreement under Section 9.1 above will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating party to the
other parties hereto. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect,
except (a) as set forth in this Section 9.2 and Article X (general provisions,
including expenses), each of which shall survive the termination of this
Agreement, and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any
breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the

                                     -62-
<PAGE>

obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of
which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement.

     9.3  Amendment.  Except as is otherwise required by applicable law, prior
          ---------
to the Closing, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any time
by execution of an instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Company;
provided, however, that after the approval of the Articles of Merger by the
shareholders of the Company, no amendment may be made which reduces the Merger
Consideration or which effects any changes which would materially adversely
affect the shareholders of the Company without the further approval of the
shareholders of the Company. Except as is otherwise required by applicable law,
after the Closing, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto at any
time by execution of an instrument in writing signed by Parent, the
Securityholder Agents and by Company shareholders who receive more than 50% of
the Parent Common Stock issued or to be issued pursuant to Section 1.6, or by

obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party.

          SEAGATE SIGNS DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE STORAGE AREA
                      NETWORK PIONEER XIOTECH CORPORATION

SCOTTS VALLEY, CA -- 03 December 1999 -- Seagate Technology, Inc. (NYSE:SEG)
today announced the execution of a definitive agreement to acquire XIOtech
Corporation, a leader in virtual storage and Storage Area Network (SAN)
solutions. XIOtech designs, manufactures, and markets high performance,
application-driven storage solutions.

The XIOtech MAGNITUDE provides over 3TB of high performance, centralized storage
that can be continuously accessed by multiple servers in a heterogeneous
environment. The MAGNITUDE is optimized for Storage Area Network (SAN)
applications, and SAN technology increasingly plays a critical role in how
digital information is stored and managed in the Internet era. SAN's offer the
scalability and manageability advantages of today's network architecture while
significantly increasing network performance by eliminating bottlenecks on the
information superhighway. SAN technology enables migration of critical types of
information intelligence from servers to storage platforms. These intelligent
storage platforms can connect directly to the network and to each other,
liberating server bandwidth, significantly increasing network performance and
reliability, and substantially reducing network management costs.

XIOtech, a privately-held company founded in 1995 in Eden Prairie, Minnesota,
sells and services its products directly to major corporations worldwide and
through an elite group of Reseller relationships and OEM partnerships within the
storage industry.

Pursuant to the agreement, the value of this transaction is approximately $360
million in Seagate common stock and Seagate anticipates that the transaction
will close next quarter. Seagate expects to account for the acquisition as a
purchase transaction. The transaction has been approved by the Boards of
Directors of both companies, but is still subject to normal conditions of
closing, XIOtech shareholder approval and the required regulatory approvals.

XIOtech Corporation designs, manufactures, and markets high performance,
application-driven storage solutions. The award-winning XIOtech MAGNITUDE's
software-based architecture provides over 3TB of high performance, centralized
storage that can be accessed continuously by multiple heterogeneous servers. The
MAGNITUDE is a Storage Area Network (SAN) in a Box, and with XIOtech's exclusive
REDI software family, is the only storage subsystem to offer server clustering
and a true zero backup window. The privately-held company, founded in 1995 in
Eden Prairie, Minn., sells and services its products directly to major
