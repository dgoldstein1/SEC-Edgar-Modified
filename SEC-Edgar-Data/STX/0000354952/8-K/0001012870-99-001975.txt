         ------------

         Seagate Technology, Inc. ("STI"), its Seagate Software, Inc. ("SSI")
subsidiary and Seagate Software Network & Storage Management Group, Inc.
("NSMG"), a wholly owned subsidiary of SSI, announced on October 5, 1998 that
they had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") as of
such date with Veritas Holding Corporation ("Newco") and Veritas Software
Corporation ("VERITAS"), which provided for (i) the contribution by SSI, STI and
certain of their respective subsidiaries to Newco of (a) the outstanding stock
of NSMG and certain other subsidiaries of SSI, and (b) those assets used
primarily in the network storage management business of SSI (the "NSMG
Business"), in consideration for the issuance of shares of Common Stock of Newco
to SSI and the offer by Newco to grant options to purchase Common Stock of Newco
to certain SSI employees who become employees of Newco or its subsidiaries in
exchange for cancellation by such employees of their respective options to
purchase Common Stock of SSI (the "Seagate Transaction") and (ii) the merger of
a wholly owned subsidiary of Newco with and into VERITAS and the assumption and
conversion of all outstanding VERITAS securities, on a share for share basis,
into Newco securities having identical rights, preferences and privileges,
including convertible debentures of VERITAS which became convertible into Common
Stock of Newco on the same basis as they were convertible into VERITAS Common
Stock (the "Veritas Merger").  As part of the Seagate Transaction, Newco also
assumed certain liabilities of the NSMG Business.  The Seagate Transaction was
structured to qualify as a tax-free exchange and the Veritas Merger was
structured to qualify as a tax-free reorganization for federal income tax
purposes.  The Seagate Transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.  The
Seagate Transaction and the Veritas Merger were closed on May 28, 1999.

Exhibit 99.1

For Immediate Release

  Seagate Completes Sale of Network
  and Storage Management Software
  Group to Veritas Software

  Deal Provides Seagate With 34.6 Million Shares Of
  VERITAS Software Stock Valued at $3.1 Billion

  SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Seagate
  Technology, Inc. (NYSE: SEG) today announced that the
  Company has completed the sale of the Network and Storage
  Management Group (NSMG), a portion of their Seagate
  Software subsidiary, to VERITAS Software (Nasdaq: VRTS -
  news ). VERITAS Software and Seagate Software NSMG will
  merge in a tax-free transaction to be accounted for under
  purchase accounting. Seagate Technology will receive
  approximately 34.6 million shares of VERITAS Software for
  Seagate Software's NSMG "business." Based on the closing
  stock price of VERITAS Software on May 28, 1999, the value
  of the shares to be received by Seagate Technology is
  approximately $3.1 billion. Seagate retains ownership of its
  remaining Seagate Software subsidiary, which will continue to
  provide innovative software solutions focused on the growing
  business intelligence market.

  "The VERITAS Software transaction increases Seagate's
  shareholder value in two distinct ways," said Seagate
  president and chief executive officer, Steve Luczo. "First, we
  further strengthened our balance sheet and shareholders'
  equity with the addition of VERITAS Software stock to our
  asset base. Second, the merger solidifies the strategic
  relationship we have with VERITAS Software, a key player in
  our vision for current and future Storage Networking platforms
  and technologies. With VERITAS Software as a strategic
  technology development partner, along with Gadzoox
  Networks, Dragon Systems, SanDisk, CVC and
  iCompression, we are well positioned to execute on our
  business strategy."

  Seagate Software remains focused on the burgeoning
  Business Intelligence market, which is estimated to grow from
  $1.6 billion to $6.2 billion by the year 2002, according to
  leading industry analysts at Gartner Group. Seagate Software
  offers a comprehensive suite of business intelligence tools
  designed to help organizations access, analyze, report and
  share vital data stored in data warehouses and ERP systems,
  in order to make better business decisions. With over 900
