                                      -9-
<PAGE>
 
and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the
Holders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such
instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any
purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of
the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in this Section.

   (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a
certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take
acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument
or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof.  Where such execution is
by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his
authority.  The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved
in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

   (c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.

   (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the
same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of
transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of
anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the Company in
reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon such
Security.

   (e) The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture
Act, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders
of Securities of any series entitled to give or take any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on
any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders of
Securities of such series.  If not set by the Company prior to the first
solicitation of a Holder of Securities of such series made by any Person in
respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such
vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if
later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided
pursuant to Section 701) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case
may be.  With regard to any record date for action to be taken by the Holders of
one or more series of Securities, only the Holders of Securities of such series
on such date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or
take, or vote on, the relevant action.  With regard to any record date set
pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the
relevant series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only
such Persons, shall be entitled to give or take the relevant action, whether or
not such Holders remain Holders after such record date.  With regard to any
action that may be given or taken hereunder only by Holders of a requisite
principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any series (or their duly
appointed agents) and for which a record date is set pursuant to this paragraph,
the Company may, at its option, set an expiration date after which no such
action purported to be given or taken by any Holder shall be effective hereunder
unless given or taken on or prior to such expiration date by Holders of the
requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such
record date (or their duly appointed agents).  On or prior to any expiration
date set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company may, on one or more occasions
at its option, extend such date to any later date. Nothing in this paragraph
shall prevent any Holder (or any duly appointed agent thereof) from giving or

                                      -10-
<PAGE>
 
taking, after any expiration date, any action identical to, or, at any time,
contrary to or different from, any action given or taken, or purported to have
been given or taken, hereunder by a Holder on or prior to such date, in which
event the Company may set a record date in respect thereof pursuant to this
paragraph.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or the Trust Indenture Act, the
Company shall not set a record date for, and the provisions of this paragraph
shall not apply with respect to, any action to be given or taken by Holders
pursuant to Section 501, 502 or 512.

   (f) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to give or
take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with
regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by one or
more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment
with regard to all or any different part of such principal amount.

Section 105.  Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.

   Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act
of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made
upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

   (1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient for every
purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the
Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust
Administration; provided, however, that such notice shall not be deemed to be
given until received by the Trustee, or

   (2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient for every
purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing and
mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company addressed to it at the
address of its principal office specified in the first paragraph of this
instrument or at any other address previously furnished in writing to the
Trustee by the Company; provided, however, that such notice shall not be deemed
to be given until received by the Company.

Section 106.  Notice to Holders; Waiver.

   Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such notice
shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in
writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected by such
event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the
latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any),
prescribed for the giving of such notice.  In any case where notice to Holders
is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any
notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such
notice with respect to other Holders.  Where this Indenture provides for notice
in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to
receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be
the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with
the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity
of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>
 
   In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of
any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such
notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute
a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Section 107.  Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

   If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of
the Trust Indenture Act that is required under such Act to be a part of and
govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of
this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act
that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to
apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.

Section 108.  Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

   The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

Section 109.  Successors and Assigns.

   All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind its
successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

Section 110.  Separability Clause.

   In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

Section 111.  Benefits of Indenture.

   Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall
give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors
hereunder, any Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar and the
Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this
Indenture.

Section 112.  Governing Law.

   This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

Section 113.  Legal Holidays.

   In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date
or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of
Payment, then (notwithstanding any 

                                      -12-
<PAGE>
 
other provision of this Indenture or the Securities (other than a provision of
the Securities of any series which specifically states that such provision shall
apply in lieu of this Section)) payment of interest or principal (and premium,
if any) need not be made at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made
on the next succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force
and effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment
Date or at the Stated Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue for the
period from and after such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment
Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be.

   If any of the terms of the Securities of any series are established by action

action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the
Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.

Section 302.  Denominations.

   The Securities of each series shall be issuable in registered form without

any series, the Securities of such series shall be issuable in denominations of

Section 303.  Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.

   The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of
the Board, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its President, one of its Vice
Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon attested by its
Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.
The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or
facsimile.

   Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were
at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

   At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the
Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance
with the Company Order (which may provide that Securities that are the subject
thereof will 

                                      -24-
<PAGE>
 
be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee from time to time upon the
telephonic or written order of Persons designated in said Company Order and that
such Persons are authorized to determine such terms and conditions of said
Securities as are specified in the Company Order) shall authenticate and deliver
such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series have been
established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as permitted by
Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the
additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities,
the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:

   (1) if the form such Securities has been established by or pursuant to a
Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been
established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

   (2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to a
Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been
established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and

   (3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and
issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in
such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations
of the Company enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and to general equity principles and to such other matters as counsel may
specify.

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be
required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner
which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding paragraph,
if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it
shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise required
pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise
required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time
authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered
at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security
of such series to be issued and contemplate issuance of all Securities of such
series.

   Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

   No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be valid
or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any
Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security
has been duly authenticated and 

                                      -25-
<PAGE>
 
delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have
been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the
Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for
cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this Indenture such
Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered
hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

Section 304.  Temporary Securities.

   Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company
may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed
or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, sub  stantially of the
tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with
such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as
the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their
execution of such Securities.

   If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause
definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay.
After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary
Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of
such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the
office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 1002 in a Place
of Payment for that series for the purpose of exchanges of Securities of such
series, without charge to the Holder.  Upon surrender for cancellation of any
one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more
definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of
a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.  Until so exchanged the temporary
Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.

Section 305.  Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.

   The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office a register
(the register maintained in such office and in any office or agency of the
Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as
the "Security Registrar") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it
may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration of Securities and
of transfers of Securities.  The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security
Registrar" for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers of Securities
as herein provided.

   Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series at
the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 1002 for such purpose in a
Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.

   At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for
other Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a
like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to
be exchanged at such office or agency.  Whenever any Securities are so

                                      -26-
<PAGE>
 
surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is
entitled to receive.

   All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

   Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for
exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed,
or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the Holder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

   No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange
of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges
pursuant to Section 304, 906, 1107 or 1404 not involving any transfer.

   The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of
Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending
at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (b) to register the
transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in
part, except in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion
thereof not to be redeemed.

   Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, any Global Security
shall be exchangeable pursuant to this Section 305 for Securities registered in
the names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Global Security or its
nominee only when (a) such Depositary notifies the Company and the Trustee in
writing that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global
Security or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency
registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor Depositary is not appointed
by the Company within 90 days, (b) the Company in its sole discretion determines
that Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security and executes
and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be
so exchangeable, (c) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of
Default or an event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented
by such Global Security or (d) there shall exist such other circumstances, if
any, as shall be specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301.  Any
Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to clause (a), (b), (c) or (d)
above, shall be surrendered by the Depositary, or such other depositary as shall
be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto, to the Trustee, as the
agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for definitive
Securities without charge to the Holder, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for each portion of such permanent Global Security, an
equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities, executed by the
Company, of the same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the
portion of such Global Security to be exchanged, which shall be in the form of
registered Securities as provided in the Company Order.

                                      -27-
<PAGE>
 
   Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of,
or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security other than pursuant to
clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) in the preceding paragraph, whether pursuant to
this Section, Sections 304, 306, 906, 1107 or 1404 or otherwise, shall be
authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security.

Section 306.  Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.

   If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a
new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

   If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to
their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b)
such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and
any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the
Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security
of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number
not contemporaneously outstanding.

   In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become or
is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead
of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

   Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

   Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of
any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or
stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be
entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with
any and all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.

   The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

Section 307.  Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

   Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to
any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid
to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
for such interest.

                                      -28-
<PAGE>
 
   In the case of Securities represented by a Global Security registered in the
name of or held by a Depositary or its nominee, unless otherwise specified by
Section 301, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, will
be made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered
owner or Holder of such Global Security.  None of the Company, the Trustee, any
Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent nor the Security Registrar for such
Securities will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest
in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records
relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

   Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder
on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and
such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

   (1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the
Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special
Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in
the following manner.  The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each Security of such series
and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall
deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount
proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of
the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this Clause
provided.  Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less
than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days
after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The
Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in
the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed
payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be
mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of Securities of such series
at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days
prior to such Special Record Date.  Notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed,
such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the
securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are
registered at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no
longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2).

   (2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities
of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements
of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such
notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice is given by the
Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such
manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.

                                      -29-
<PAGE>
 
   At the option of the Company, interest on Securities of any series that bear
interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person entitled
thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, except as
otherwise provided pursuant to Section 301.

   Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security delivered
under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in
lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and
unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

Section 308.  Persons Deemed Owners.

   Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the
Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the
Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security
for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (except
as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301(3) and subject to Section
307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee
nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

   In the case of a Global Security, so long as the Depositary for such Global
Security, or its nominee, is the registered owner of such Global Security, such
Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole
owner or Holder of the Securities represented by such Global Security for all
purposes under this Indenture.  Except as provided in Section 305, owners of
beneficial interests in a Global Security will not be entitled to have
Securities that are represented by such Global Security registered in their
names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of such
Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or Holders
thereof under this Indenture.

   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Security, nothing
herein shall (a) prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company
or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other
authorization furnished by a Depositary or (b) impair, as between a Depositary
and holders of beneficial interests in any Global Security, the operation of
customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depositary as
Holder of such Global Security.

   None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security Registrar
will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating
to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests of a Security
issued in global form or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records
relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Section 309.  Cancellation.

   All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of transfer
or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered
to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and shall be
promptly canceled by it.  The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for
cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder
which the Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to
the Trustee (or to any other 

                                      -30-
<PAGE>
 
Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously
authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all
Securities so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Trustee. No Securities
shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities canceled as
provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All
canceled Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of by the Trustee in
accordance with its customary practices and the Trustee shall from time to time,
or upon request by the Company, deliver to the Company certificates of destruc
tion with respect thereto.

Section 310.  Computation of Interest.

   Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities
of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on
the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

                (i)  have become due and payable, or

               (ii)  will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within
                     one year and are not repayable at the option of the Holder
                     prior thereto, or

              (iii)  are to be called for redemption within one year under
                     arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
                     notice of redemption by the

                     Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company and
                     are not repayable at the option of the Holder prior
                     thereto,

     and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or
     caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the
     purpose, lawful money of the United States or U.S. Government Obligations
     which through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in
     accordance with their terms will provide lawful money not later than the
     due dates of principal (and premium, if any) or interest, or any
     combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the
     entire indebtedness on such Securities not theretofore delivered to the
     Trustee for cancellation, for principal and any premium and interest to the
     date of such deposit (in the case of Securities which have become due and
     payable) or to the Stated Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;

     (2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
hereunder by the Company; and

     (3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions precedent herein
provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have
been complied with.

     In the event there are Securities of two or more series hereunder, the
Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction
and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to the
Securities of all series to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions
thereto are met.  In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then
the effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of
such instruments from all Trustees hereunder.

     Notwithstanding the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, the
obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of
the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall
have been deposited with the Trustee pursuant to subclause (B) of Clause (1) of
this Section, the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last
paragraph of Section 1003 shall survive.

Section 402.  Application of Trust Money.

     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money
and U.S. Government Obligations deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section
401 shall be held in trust and applied by it, in accordance with the provisions
of the Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through
any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the
Trustee may determine, to the Persons entitled thereto as set forth in the
Securities Register, of the principal and any premium and interest for whose
payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.

Section 501.  Events of Default.

     "Event of Default", wherever used herein with respect to Securities of any
series, means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such
Event of Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected
by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body),
except to the extent such event is specifically deleted or modified as
contemplated by Section 301 for the Securities of that series:

     (1) default in the payment of any interest upon any Security of that series
when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of such default for a period of
30 days; or

     (2) default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any
Security of that series at its Maturity; or

     (3) default in the deposit of any sinking fund payment, when and as due by
the terms of a Security of that series; or

     (4) default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or warranty of
the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant or warranty a default in
whose performance or whose breach is specifically dealt with elsewhere in this
Section or which has expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the
benefit of a series of Securities other than that series or which has been
included in this Indenture but not made applicable to the Securities of such
series), and continuance of such default or breach for a period of 90 days after
there has been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the
Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 15% in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice
specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating
that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

     (5) failure by the Company to make any payment at maturity, including any
applicable grace period, in respect of indebtedness, which term as used herein
means obligations (other than the Securities of such series or non-recourse
obligations) of the Company for borrowed money or evidenced by bonds,
debentures, notes or other similar instruments ("Indebtedness") in an amount in
excess of $25,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in any other currency or
composite currency and such failure shall have continued for thirty (30) days
after written notice thereof shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee
or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 15% in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a written notice specifying
such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such
notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

     (6) a default with respect to any Indebtedness, which default results in
the acceleration of Indebtedness in an amount in excess of $25,000,000 or the
equivalent thereof in any other currency 

                                      -33-
<PAGE>
 
or composite currency without such Indebtedness having been discharged or such
acceleration having been cured, waived, rescinded or annulled for a period of
thirty (30) days after written notice thereof shall have been given to the
Company by the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at
least 15% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series a
written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied
and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

     (7) the entry by a court having jurisdiction in the premises of (a) a
decree or order for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or
proceeding under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar law or (b) a decree or order adjudging the
Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or approving as properly filed a petition
seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition of or in respect
of the Company under any applicable Federal or State law, or appointing a
custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other
similar official of the Company or of any substantial part of its properties, or
ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and the continuance of
any such decree or order for relief or any such other decree or order unstayed
and in effect for a period of 90 consecutive days; or

     (8) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or proceeding under
any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
similar law or of any other case or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or
insolvent, or the consent by the Company to the entry of a decree or order for
relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case or proceeding under any
applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
similar law or to the commencement of any bankruptcy or insolvency case or
proceeding against the Company, or the filing by the Company of a petition or
answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under any applicable Federal
or State law, or the consent by the Company to the filing of such petition or to
the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian, receiver, liquidator,
assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar official of the Company or of
any substantial part of its properties, or the making by the Company of an
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the admission by the Company in
writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the
taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or

     (9) any other Event of Default established as contemplated by Section 301
with respect to Securities of that series;

provided that if any such failure, default or acceleration referred to in
clauses (5) or (6) above shall cease or be cured, waived, rescinded or annulled,
then the Event of Default hereunder by reason thereof shall be deemed likewise
to have been thereupon cured.

     Upon receipt by the Trustee of any Notice of Default pursuant to this
Section 501 with respect to Securities of any series, a record date shall
automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for the purpose
of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to
join in such Notice of Default, which record date shall be the close of business
on the day the Trustee receives such Notice of Default.  Promptly after the
establishment of a record date pursuant to the provisions of this Section 501,
the Trustee shall notify the Company and the Holders of Outstanding Securities
of such 

                                      -34-
<PAGE>
 
series of the establishment of such record date. The Holders of Outstanding
Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents),
and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such Notice of Default,
whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided
that, unless such Notice of Default shall have become effective by virtue of
Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such
series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents) having joined
therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date, such Notice of
Default shall automatically and without any action by any Person be canceled and
of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder (or a
duly appointed agent thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration of
such 90-day period, a Notice of Default contrary to or different from, or, after
the expiration of such period, identical to, a Notice of Default that has been
canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new
record date in respect thereof shall be set pursuant to this paragraph.

Section 502.  Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.

     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time
Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of
that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the
principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of
all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a
notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and
upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall
become immediately due and payable.

     At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the
Trustee, may rescind and annul such acceleration and its consequences if:

     (1)  the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum sufficient to
pay

          (A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,

          (B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of that
     series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of
     acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed
     therefor in such Securities, to the extent that payment of such interest is
     lawful,

          (C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest
     upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such
     Securities, and

                                      -35-
<PAGE>
 
          (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
     reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
     Trustee, its agents and counsel;

and

     (2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series, other
than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series which have
become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived
as provided in Section 513.

     No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

     Upon receipt by the Trustee of any declaration of acceleration, or any
rescission and annulment of any such declaration, pursuant to this Section 502
with respect to Securities of any series, a record date shall automatically and
without any other action by any Person be set for the purpose of determining the
Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such
declaration, or rescission or annulment, as the case may be, which record date
shall be the close of business on the day the Trustee receives such declaration,
or rescission and annulment, as the case may be.  Promptly after the
establishment of a record date pursuant to the provisions of this Section 502,
the Trustee shall notify the Company and the Holders of Outstanding Securities
of such series of the establishment of such record date.  The Holders of
Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly
appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such
declaration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, whether or not
such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provided that, unless such
declaration, or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall have become
effective by virtue of Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding
Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents)
having joined therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date, such
declaration or rescission and annulment, as the case may be, shall automatically
and without any action by any Person be canceled and of no further effect.
Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder (or a duly appointed agent
thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration of such 90-day period, a
declaration of acceleration, or a rescission and annulment of any such
declaration, contrary to or different from, or, after the expiration of such
period, identical to, a declaration, or rescission and annulment, as the case
may be, that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding
sentence, in which event a new record date in respect thereof shall be set
pursuant to this paragraph.

Section 503.  Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.

     The Company covenants that if

     (1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security when
such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of
30 days, or

     (2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any,
on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, or

                                      -36-
<PAGE>
 
     (3) default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or
analogous obligation when the same becomes due by the terms of the Securities of
any series, and any such default continues for any period of grace provided with
respect to the Securities of such series,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holder of any such Security (or the Holders of any such series in the case of
clause (3) above), the whole amount then due and payable on any such Security
(or on the Securities of any such series in the case of clause (3) above) for
principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and
premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor by
the terms of any such Security (or of Securities of any such series in the case
of clause (3) above); and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel.

     If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series and
collect the money adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by
law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such
Securities, wherever situated.

     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce
its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to
protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any
covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

Section 504.  Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

     In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other
obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall
be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to
take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to
have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding.  In
particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or
other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator
or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized
by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments to the Trustee and, in the
event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to
the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.

                                      -37-
<PAGE>
 
     No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities
or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

Section 505.  Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.

     All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may
be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the
Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any
such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as
trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision
for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of
the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been
recovered.

Section 506.  Application of Money Collected.

     Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be
applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and,
in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium
or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the
payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

     FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section 607;

     SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for principal of
and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of which or for the
benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably, without preference or
priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on such
Securities for principal and any premium and interest, respectively; and

     THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company or any other Person or Persons
entitled thereto.

     In any case where Securities are outstanding which are denominated in more
than one currency, or in a composite currency and at least one other currency,
and the Trustee is directed to make ratable payments under this Section to
Holders of Securities, the Trustee shall calculate the amount of such payments
as follows: (i) as of the day the Trustee collects an amount under this Article,
the Trustee shall, as to each Holder of a Security to whom an amount is due and
payable under this Section which is denominated in a foreign currency or a
composite currency, determine that amount of U.S. Dollars that would be obtained
for the amount owing such Holder, using the rate of exchange at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City
of New York U.S. Dollars with such amount owing, (ii) calculate the sum of all
U.S. Dollar amounts determined under (i) and add thereto any amounts due and
payable in U.S. Dollars; and (iii) using the individual amounts determined in
(i) or any individual amounts due and payable in U.S. Dollars, as the case may
be, as a numerator and the sum calculated in (ii) as a denominator, calculate as
to each Holder of a Security to whom an amount is owed under this Section the
fraction of the amount collected under this Article payable to such Holder.  Any

                                      -38-
<PAGE>
 
expenses incurred by the Trustee in actually converting amounts owing Holders of
Securities denominated in a currency or composite currency other than that in
which any amount is collected under this Article shall be likewise (in
accordance with this paragraph) borne ratably by all Holders of Securities to
whom amounts are payable under this Section.

     To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, if for the purpose of
obtaining judgment against the Company in any court it is necessary to convert
the sum due in respect of the principal of, or any premium or interest on the
Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which
judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used
shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the
Judgment Currency on the New York Business Day preceding that on which final
judgment is given.  The Company shall not be liable for any shortfall nor shall
it benefit from any windfall in payments to Holders of Securities under this
Section caused by a change in exchange rates between the time the amount of a
judgment against it is calculated as above and the time the Trustee converts the
Judgment Currency into the Required Currency to make payments under this Section
to Holders of Securities, but payment of such judgment shall discharge all
amounts owed by the Company on the claim or claims underlying such judgment.

Section 507.  Limitation on Suits.

     No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute
any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for
the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder,
unless:

     (1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that series;

     (2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of that series shall have made written request to the Trustee to
institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its own name as
Trustee hereunder;

     (3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable indemnity
against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with
such request;

     (4) the Trustee for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer
of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and

     (5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given to
the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other 

                                      -39-
<PAGE>
 
of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over
any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except
in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of
such Holders.

Section 508.  Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and
Interest.

     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of any
Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and (except as specified as
contemplated by Section 301(3) and subject to Section 307) any interest on such
Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in
the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without
the consent of such Holder.

Section 509.  Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

     If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any
right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued
or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or
to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in
such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored
severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter
all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though
no such proceeding had been instituted.

Section 510.  Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

     Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section
306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to
the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise.  The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 511.  Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

     No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to
exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any
such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an
acquiescence therein.  Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to
the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often
as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may
be.

Section 512.  Control by Holders.

     The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available 

                                      -40-
<PAGE>
 
to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with
respect to the Securities of such series, provided that

     (1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with
this Indenture,

     (2) the Trustee shall not determine (it being understood that the Trustee
shall have no obligation to make such determination) that the action so directed
would be unjustly prejudicial to Holders of Securities of that series, or any
other series, not taking part in such direction, and

     (3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee
which is not inconsistent with such direction.

     Upon receipt by the Trustee of any Notice of Default pursuant to this
Section 512 with respect to Securities of any series, a record date shall
automatically and without any other action by any Person be set for the purpose
of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to
join in such Notice of Default, which record date shall be the close of business
on the day the Trustee receives such Notice of Default.  Promptly after the
establishment of a record date pursuant to the provisions of this Section 512,
the Trustee shall notify the Company and the Holders of Outstanding Securities
of such series of the establishment of such record date.  The Holders of
Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly
appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such
Notice of Default, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record
date; provided that, unless such Notice of Default shall have become effective
by virtue of Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities
of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents) having
joined therein on or prior to the 90th day after such record date, such Notice
of Default shall automatically and without any action by any Person be canceled
and of no further effect.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder (or
a duly appointed agent thereof) from giving, before or after the expiration of
such 90-day period, a Notice of Default contrary to or different from, or, after
the expiration of such period, identical to, a Notice of Default that has been
canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in which event a new
record date in respect thereof shall be set pursuant to this paragraph.


Section 513.  Waiver of Past Defaults.

     The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the
Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such
series and its consequences, except a default

     (1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on any
Security of such series, or

     (2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article Nine
cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Security of such series affected.

                                     -41-
<PAGE>
 
     Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose
of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 514.  Undertaking for Costs.

     In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to
file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against
any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust
Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act
shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make
such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.

Section 515.  Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

     The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it
will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law
and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

     The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the
Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to Section 107),
no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any
of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if
it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to
it.  Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this
Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording
protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

Section 602.  Notice of Defaults.

Trustee shall give the Holders of Securities of such series notice of such
default known to the Trustee as and to the extent provided by the Trust
Indenture Act and in the manner provided in Section 106; provided, however, that

                                     -42-
<PAGE>
 
in the case of any default of the character specified in Sections 501(4), 501(5)
and 501(6) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders
shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof.  For the

notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect
to Securities of such series.

     evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad
     faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;

          (4) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of
     such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
     authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
     omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

          (5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
     rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction
     of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture (including, without
     limitation, under Section 512), unless such Holders shall have offered to

     and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such
     request or direction;

     document; and

Section 604.  Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.

     The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the Trustee's
certificates of authentication, shall be taken as the statements of the Company,

correctness.  The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or
sufficiency of this Indenture or of the Securities.  The Trustee or any
Authenticating Agent shall not be accountable for the use or application by the
Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.

Section 607.  Compensation and Reimbursement.

     The Company agrees

          (1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation
     for all services rendered by it hereunder (which compensation shall not be
     limited by any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee
     of an express trust);

          (2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
     Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
     advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with any provision
     of this Indenture (including the reasonable compensation and the expenses

     expense, disbursement or advance may be attributable to its negligence or
     bad faith; and

          (3) to indemnify the Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any
     loss, liability or expense, arising out of or in connection with the
     acceptance or administration of the trust or trusts hereunder or the
     performance of its duties hereunder, including the costs and expenses of
     defending itself against any claim or liability in connection with the
     exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to
     the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its

     As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company under
this Section the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities upon all
property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds held
in trust for payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest, if any,

     "Trustee", for purposes of this Section 607, includes any predecessor
Trustee, provided that the negligence or bad faith of any Trustee shall not
affect the rights under this Section 607 of any other Trustee.

Section 608.  Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.

     If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the
meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such
interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to
the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture, and the Company
shall take prompt action to have a successor Trustee appointed in the manner
provided herein.  For purposes of Section 301(b)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act,
no Trustee hereunder will be deemed to have a conflicting interest solely by
reason of being Trustee in respect of more than one series of Securities.

Section 609.  Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

     There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder with respect to the
Securities of each series, which shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to
the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of
at least $50,000,000, be subject to supervision or examination by Federal or
State authority.  If such Person publishes reports of condition at least
annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or
examining authority, then, for the purposes of this Section, the combined
capital and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital
and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.
If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with
the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 611.

     (b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of
one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company.  If the
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall
not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such
notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series.

                                      -45-
<PAGE>
 
     (c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the Securities
of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to the
Company.

     (d)  If at any time:

          (A) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 608 after written
     request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide
     Holder of a Security for at least six months, or

          (B) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609 and shall
     fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by any such
     Holder, or

          (C) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged
     a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property
     shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of
     the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
     rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove the
Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 514, any
Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months
may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court
of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all
Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

     (e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of acting,
or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect
to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution,
shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor
Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of
such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to
the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable
requirements of Section 611.  If, within six months after such resignation,
removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such
series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee
so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent
supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.  If no successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so
appointed by the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner
required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Security of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and
all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for
the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series.

                                      -46-
<PAGE>
 
     (f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each removal of
the Trustee with respect to Securities of any series and each appointment of a
successor Trustee with respect to Securities of any series to all Holders of
Securities of such series in the manner provided in Section 106.  Each notice
shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities
of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

Section 611.  Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

     (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request
of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon
payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and
shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property
and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

     (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the
retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall
contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (ii)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall
contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by
any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental
indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such
retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor
Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with
respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of
such successor Trustee relates.

                                      -47-

     (c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute
any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming
to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in
paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

     (d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of
such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article.

Section 612.  Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.

     Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto.  In case any Securities shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.
In the event any Securities shall not have been authenticated by such
predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver
such Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with
the full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of
authentication of the Trustee.

Section 613.  Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

of Sections 311(b)(4) and 311(b)(6) of the Trust Indenture Act, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or
securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers
acceptances and payable upon demand.

sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by documents evidencing
title to, possession of or a lien upon, the goods, wares or merchandise or the
receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods, wares or merchandise
previously constituting the security, provided the security is received by the
Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor relationship with the
Company arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or incurring of the draft,
bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.

Section 614.  Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

     The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to
one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of
the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue
and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or
pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all
purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is
made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the
Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be
deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.  Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and
doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof
or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating
Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority.  If such
Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then,
for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published.  If at any time
an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

     Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an
Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

     An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Trustee and the Company.  The Trustee may at any time terminate
the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such
Authenticating Agent and to the Company.  Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating
Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of
such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of
Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will
serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.
No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the
provisions of this Section.

                                      -49-

     The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions
of Section 607.

     If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to
this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in
addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative
certificate of authentication in the following form:

     This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.

     such addition, change or elimination (i) shall not apply to any Security of
     any series created prior to the execution of such supplemental indenture
     and entitled to the benefit of such provision or (ii) shall become
     effective only when there is no such Security Outstanding; or

          (6) to secure the Securities pursuant to the requirements of Section

     of Securities of any series in any material respect.

Section 902.  Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Holders.

     With the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities of each series affected by such

Holders of Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however,
that no such supplemental indenture shall without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Security affected thereby,

          (1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment
     of principal of or interest on, any Security, or reduce the principal
     amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon
     the redemption thereof, or reduce the amount of the principal of an

     may be), or

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

     Indenture, or

          (3) modify any of the provisions of this Section, Section 513 or
     Section 1010, except to increase any such percentage or to provide that
     certain other provisions of this Indenture cannot be modified or waived

     thereby, provided, however, that this clause shall not be deemed to require
     the consent of any Holder with respect to changes in the references to "the
     Trustee" and concomitant changes in this Section and Section 1010, or the
     deletion of this proviso, in accordance with the requirements of Sections
     611(b) and 901(8).

A supplemental indenture which changes or eliminates any covenant or other
provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for the
benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies the
rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such covenant
or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this
Indenture of the Holders of Securities of any other series.

approve the particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture, but it shall
be sufficient if such Act shall approve the substance thereof.

Section 906.  Reference in Securities to Supplemental Indentures.

     Securities of any series authenticated and delivered after the execution of
any supplemental indenture pursuant to this Article may, and shall if required
by the Trustee, bear a notation in form approved by the Trustee as to any matter
provided for in such supplemental indenture.  If the Company shall so determine,
new Securities of any series so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the
Trustee and the Company, to any such supplemental indenture may be prepared and

                                   COVENANTS

Section 1001.  Payment of Principal Premium and Interest.

     The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of
Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any premium
and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the terms of
the Securities and this Indenture.

Section 1002.  Maintenance of Office or Agency.

     The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of
Securities an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented
or surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered
for registration of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or
upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture
may be served.  The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of
the location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency.  If at
any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency
or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the
Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and
demands.

     The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices
or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in
any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency
in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes.  The
Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation
or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or
agency.

Section 1003.  Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.

     If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect
to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series,
segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a
sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to
act.

     Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of
Securities, it will, on or prior to each due date of the principal of or any
premium or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying
Agent a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by
the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the
Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

     The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other
than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which
such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of
this Section, that such Paying Agent will (a) comply with the provisions of the
Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (b) during the
continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the
Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the
Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith
pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in
respect of the Securities of that series.

     The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction
and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company
Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by
the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the
same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such
Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such
Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such
money.

     Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or
interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Company on Company Request (including interest income on such funds,
if any), or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust;
and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured general
creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the
Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability
of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.

Section 1004.  Statement by Officers as to Default.

     The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, a brief
certificate from the principal executive, financial or 

                                      -57-
<PAGE>
 
accounting officer or Treasurer of the Company as to his or her knowledge of the
Company's compliance (without regard to any period of grace or requirement of
notice provided hereunder) with all conditions and covenants hereof.

Section 1005.  Existence.

     Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate
existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise
if the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss
thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 1006.  Maintenance of Properties.

     The Company will cause all material properties used or useful in the
conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and
kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary
equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals,
replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as (and to the extent)
in the judgment of the Company may be necessary or appropriate in connection
with its business; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent
the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such
properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable
in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 1007.  Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

     The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, within
30 days after the Company shall have received notice that the same has become
delinquent (1) all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied
or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or
property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a material lien
upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability
or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings;
provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or
cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim unless
the failure to pay or discharge such tax, assessment, charge or claim would,
individually or in the aggregate with all such failures, have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 1008.  Limitations on Liens.

     (a) Unless the terms of a particular series of Securities otherwise
provide, so long as any Securities of such series remain Outstanding, the
Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted 

                                      -58-
<PAGE>
 
Subsidiary to, issue, incur, create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed
money (hereinafter in this Article 10 referred to as "Debt"), secured by a
mortgage, security interest, pledge, lien, charge or other encumbrance
(mortgages, security interests, pledges, liens, charges and other encumbrances
being hereinafter in this Article 10, referred to as "mortgage" or "mortgages")
upon any Principal Property of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or upon
any shares of stock or indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary (whether such
Principal Property, shares of stock or indebtedness are now existing or owed or
hereafter created or acquired) without in any such case effectively providing
concurrently with the issuance, incurrence, creation, assumption or guaranty of
any such Debt that the Securities of such series Outstanding (together with, if
the Company shall so determine, any other indebtedness of or guarantee by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary ranking equally with the Securities of
such series Outstanding and then existing or thereafter created) shall be
secured equally and ratably with (or, at the Company's option, prior to) such
Debt; provided, however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to Debt
secured by:

          (1) mortgages on property, shares of stock, indebtedness or other
     assets of any corporation existing at the time such corporation becomes a
     Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such mortgages or liens are not
     incurred in anticipation of such corporation becoming a Restricted
     Subsidiary;

          (2) (A) mortgages on property, shares of stock, indebtedness or other
     assets existing at the time of acquisition thereof by the Company or a
     Restricted Subsidiary (which may include property previously leased by the
     Company and leasehold interests thereon, provided that the lease terminates
     prior to or upon the acquisition) or mortgages thereon to secure the
     payment of all or any part of the purchase price thereof, or (B) mortgages
     on property, shares of stock, indebtedness or other assets to secure any
     Debt incurred prior to, at the time of, or within 270 days after, the
     latest of the acquisition thereof, or, in the case of property, the
     completion of construction, the completion of improvements or the
     commencement of substantial commercial operation of such property for the
     purpose of financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof, such
     construction or the making of such improvements;

          (3) mortgages securing Debt owing to the Company or to a Restricted
     Subsidiary;

          (4) mortgages existing on the date of initial issuance of the
     Securities of such series;

          (5) mortgages on property or other assets of a corporation existing at
     the time such corporation is merged into or consolidated with the Company
     or a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of a sale, lease or other
     disposition of the properties of a corporation as an entirety or
     substantially as an entirety to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;
     provided that such mortgage was not incurred in anticipation of such merger
     or consolidation or sale, lease or other disposition;

          (6) mortgages on or other conveyances of property or other assets
     owned by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in favor of the United
     States of America or any State, territory or possession thereof (or the
     District of Columbia), or any department, agency, 

                                      -59-
<PAGE>
 
     instrumentality or political subdivision of the United States of America or
     any State, territory or possession thereof (or the District of Columbia),
     to secure partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any
     contract or statute or to secure any Debt incurred for the purpose of
     financing all or any part of the purchase price or the cost of construction
     or improvement of the property subject to such mortgages;

          (7) mortgages created in connection with a project financed with, and
     created to secure, a Nonrecourse Obligation; or

          (8) any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions,
     renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any mortgage referred to
     in the foregoing clauses (1) to (7), inclusive, without increase of the
     principal of the Debt secured thereby; provided, however, that such
     extension, renewal or replacement shall be limited to all or a part of the
     property which secured the mortgage so extended, renewed or replaced (plus
     improvements on such property); and provided, further, that any mortgage
     permitted by any of the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and
     (7) of this Section 1008 shall not extend to or cover any property of the
     Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, other than the
     property specified in such clauses and improvements thereto.

     (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1008, the
Company and any one or more Restricted Subsidiaries may issue, incur, create,
assume or guarantee Debt secured by mortgages which would otherwise be subject
to the foregoing restrictions ("Exempted Secured Debt") in an aggregate amount
which, together with all other outstanding Debt of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries which (if originally issued, incurred, created, assumed
or guaranteed at such time) would otherwise be subject to the foregoing
restrictions (including Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-Backs as
provided in Section 1009, but not including Debt permitted to be secured under
any of clauses (1) through (8) above or Attributable Debt with respect to a Sale
and Lease-Back if Debt at least equal in amount to the Attributable Debt in
respect of such Sale and Lease-Back could have been issued, incurred, created,
assumed or guaranteed by the Company or one or more Restricted Subsidiaries
under any of clauses (1) through (8) above), does not at the time exceed 10% of
Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Company.

Section 1009.  Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions.

     (a) If the terms of a particular series of Securities so provide, so long
as any Securities of such series remain Outstanding, the Company will not, nor
will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into any direct or indirect
arrangement with any person that provides for the leasing to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary of any Principal Property (except for leases for a term of
not more than three years and except for leases between the Company and a
Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries), which Principal
Property has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary to such person (such arrangement herein in this Section
1009 referred to as a "Sale and Lease-Back"), unless:

                                      -60-
<PAGE>
 
          (1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled,
     pursuant to the provisions of Section 1008, to issue, incur, create, assume
     or guarantee Debt secured by a mortgage upon such property at least equal
     in amount to the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back
     without equally and ratably securing the Securities of such series
     Outstanding; provided, however, that from and after the date on which such
     Sale and Lease-Back becomes effective the Attributable Debt in respect of
     such Sale and Lease-Back shall be deemed for all purposes under Section
     1008 and this Section 1009 to be Debt subject to the provisions of Section
     1008 (including, to the extent relying on the provisions of Section
     1008(b), for purposes of calculating Exempted Secured Debt as provided in
     Section 1008(b)); or

          (2) within 180 days of the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back,
     the Company shall apply an amount in cash equal to the greater of the net
     proceeds of the sale involved in such Sale and Lease-Back or the
     Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back either (or a
     combination of) (i) to the retirement (other than any mandatory retirement,
     mandatory prepayment or sinking fund payment or by way of payment at
     maturity), of Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
     Debt owed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or any
     Restricted Subsidiary or Debt which is subordinate to Securities of such
     series Outstanding) which by its terms matures at or is extendible or
     renewable at the option of the obligor to a date more than twelve months
     after the date of the creation of such Debt, or (ii) to the purchase,
     construction or development (or any combination thereof) of other
     comparable property.

     (b) For the purposes of this Section 1009, the term "Attributable Debt"
with respect to a Sale and Lease-Back involving a Principal Property means, at
the time of determination, the lesser of:

          (1) the fair market value of the property which is the subject of such
     Sale and Lease-Back (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors)
     or,

          (2) the then present value of the total net amount of rent required to
     be paid under the lease in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back during the
     remaining term thereof (including any renewal term or period for which such
     lease has been extended) computed by discounting from the respective due
     dates to such date such total net amount of rent at the actual interest
     factor included in such rent or implicit in the terms of the applicable
     Sale and Lease-Back, or, if not practicable to determine such rate, the
     rate per annum equal to the weighted average interest rate per annum borne
     by the Securities of each series outstanding pursuant to this Indenture
     compounded semi-annually, in either case as determined in good faith by the
     principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, which computation
     shall be binding for purposes of this Indenture absent manifest error;
     provided, however, that the net amount of rent required to be paid for any
     such period shall be the aggregate amount of the rent payable by the lessee
     with respect to such period after excluding amounts required to be paid on
     account of or contingent upon maintenance and repairs, insurance, taxes,
     assessments, water rates and similar charges.  In the case of any lease
     which is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty, such net
     amount shall be the lesser of (i) the net amount determined assuming
     termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case
     the net amount shall also include the amount 

                                      -61-

     of the penalty, but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid
     under such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so
     terminated) or (ii) the net amount determined assuming no such termination.

     (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1009, the
Company and any one or more Restricted Subsidiaries may enter into an
arrangement that provides for the leasing to the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary of any Principal Property which would otherwise be subject to the
foregoing restrictions without applying the net proceeds of such transactions in
the manner set forth in clause (b) above, provided that after giving effect
thereto, the aggregate amount of such Sale and Lease-Back Transactions, together
with the aggregate amount of all debt secured by mortgages not permitted by
clauses (1) through (8) under the limitation in the Indenture on mortgages, does
not exceed 10% of the Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Company.

Section 1010.  Waiver of Certain Covenants.

     The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term,
provision or condition set forth in Sections 1008 and 1009 with respect to the
Securities of any series if before the time for such compliance the Holders of
not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such
instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition,
but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition
except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become
effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in
respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and
effect.

specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series) in
accordance with this Article.

Section 1102.  Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

     The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by
a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of
less than all the Securities of any series of the same tenor, the Company shall,
at least 60 days (45 days in the case of redemption of all Securities of any
series or of any series with the same (i) Stated Maturity, (ii) period or
periods within which, price or prices at which and terms and conditions upon
which such Securities may or shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company or pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous
provision or repayable at the option of the Holder and (iii) rate or rates at
which the Securities 

                                      -62-
<PAGE>
 
bear interest, if any, or formula pursuant to which such rate or rates accrue
(collectively, the "Equivalent Principal Terms")) prior to the Redemption Date
fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the
Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date of the principal amount of
Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the
Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to
the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of
such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the
Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such
restriction.

Section 1103.  Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.

     If less than all the Securities with Equivalent Principal Terms of any
series are to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of such series and of a
specified tenor are to be redeemed), the particular Securities to be redeemed
shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the
Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called
for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate
and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the
minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series with Equivalent
Principal Terms or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of
Securities of such series with Equivalent Principal Terms of a denomination
larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series.
Unless otherwise provided in the terms of a particular series of Securities, the
portions of the principal of Securities so selected for partial redemption shall
be equal to the minimum authorized denomination of the Securities of such
series, or an integral multiple thereof, and the principal amount which remains
outstanding shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination for
Securities of such series.

     The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the
case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion
of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.

Section 1104.  Notice of Redemption.

     Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date,
unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed, to each
Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security
Register.

     Any notice that is mailed to the Holder of any Securities in the manner
herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether
or not such Holder receives the notice.

                                      -63-
<PAGE>
 
     All notices of redemption shall state:

          (1)  the Redemption Date,

          (2) the Redemption Price and the amount of accrued interest, if any,
     to be paid,

          (3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to
     be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of
     any Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be
     redeemed,

          (4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
     which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption
     Date, upon surrender of such Security, the Holder of such Security will
     receive, without charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized
     denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed,

          (5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due
     and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that
     interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,

          (6) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered
     for payment of the Redemption Price, and

          (7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.

     Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the
Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable.

Section 1105.  Deposit of Redemption Price.

     On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of
money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemp  tion
Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities
which are to be redeemed on that date.

Section 1106.  Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

     Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to
be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the
Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued
interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest.  Upon surrender of any
such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall
be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise 

                                      -64-
<PAGE>
 
specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated
Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of
such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at
the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and
the provisions of Section 307.

     If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender
thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear
interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the
Security.

Section 1107.  Securities Redeemed in Part.

     Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a
Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due
endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service
charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of
any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of
the Security so surrendered.

the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

     The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of
Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund
payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the
terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking
fund payment".  The cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to
reduction as provided in Section 1202.  Each sinking fund payment shall be
applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the
terms of Securities of such series.

Section 1202.  Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.

     The Company (a) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than
any previously called for redemption) and (b) may apply as a credit Securities
of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company
pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted
optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each
case in

<PAGE>
 
satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the
Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such
Securities as provided for by the terms of such Series; provided that such
Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be
received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price
specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking
fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 1203.  Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.

     Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any
series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for
that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by delivering the crediting Securities of that series

date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking
fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of
the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the
Company in the manner provided in Section 1104.  Such notice having been duly
given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the
manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.

                      DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE

of any series to the extent specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities of such series.

Section 1302.  Defeasance and Discharge.

     The Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations
with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series as provided in this
Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are
satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance").  For this purpose, such Defeasance
means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire
indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of such series and to
have satisfied all of its other obligations under the Securities of such series
and this Indenture insofar as the Securities of such series are concerned (and
the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments
acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall survive until
otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder:  (a) the rights of Holders of
Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in
Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments in respect of
the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities of such series
when payments are due, (b) the Company's 

                                      -66-
<PAGE>
 
obligations with respect to the Securities of such series under Sections 304,
305, 306, 1002 and 1003, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities
of the Trustee hereunder and (d) this Article Thirteen. Subject to compliance
with this Article Thirteen, the Company may defease the Outstanding Securities
of any series pursuant to this Section 1302 notwithstanding the prior Defeasance
of the Outstanding Securities of such series pursuant to Section 1303.

Section 1303.  Covenant Defeasance.

     The Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 1005
through 1009, inclusive, and the occurrence of any event specified in Sections
501(4) (with respect to any of Sections 1005 through 1009 inclusive) and 501(9)
shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with
respect to Outstanding Securities of any series as provided in this Section on
and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied
(hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance").  For this purpose, such Covenant
Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no
liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such
specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)),
whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to
any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other
provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture
and the Securities of such series shall be unaffected thereby.

Section 1304.  Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

     The following shall be the conditions to Defeasance pursuant to Section
1302 or Covenant Defeasance pursuant to Section 1303 of the Outstanding
Securities of any series:

          (1) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be
     deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee that satisfies the
     requirements contemplated by Section 609 and agrees to comply with the
     provisions of this Article Thirteen applicable to it) as trust funds in
     trust for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically
     pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the
     Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series, (A) money in an amount,
     or (B) U.S. Government Obligations that through the scheduled payment of
     principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms
     will provide, not later than the due date of any payment, money in an
     amount, or (C) a combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the
     opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
     expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to
     pay and discharge each installment of principal (including mandatory
     sinking fund payments and amounts that may be payable at the option of the
     Holder on any Repayment Date) of, and premium (not relating to optional
     redemption), if any, and interest on, the Outstanding Securities of such
     series on the dates such installments of principal of, and premium (not
     relating to optional redemption), if any, or interest are due.

          (2) In the case of Defeasance under Section 1302, the Company shall
     have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the
     Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
     Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date first set forth 

                                      -67-
<PAGE>
 
     hereinabove, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax
     law, in either case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such
     opinion shall confirm that, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of
     such series will not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes
     as a result of the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with
     respect to the Securities of such series and will be subject to Federal
     income tax on the same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as
     would be the case if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to
     occur.

          (3) In the case of Covenant Defeasance under Section 1303, the Company
     shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
     that the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not
     recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result
     of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to the
     Securities of such series and will be subject to Federal income tax on the
     same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case
     if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.

          (4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
     Certificate to the effect that the Securities of such series, if then
     listed on any securities exchange, will not be delisted as a result of such
     deposit.

          (5) No Event of Default or event that (after notice or lapse of time
     or both) would become an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
     continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any Event of
     Default or any such event specified in Sections 501(7) and (8), at any time
     on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being
     understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after
     such 90th day).

          (6) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee
     to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture
     Act (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of the such
     Act).

          (7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance (including the deposit
     pursuant to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance) shall not result in a
     breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Indenture or any
     other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which
     it is bound.

          (8) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
     Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
     precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been
     complied with.

          (9) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the
     trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within
     the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless such
     trust shall be qualified under such Act or exempt from regulation
     thereunder.

Section 1305.  Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to be Held in
Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

     Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money
and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with
the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and
Section 1306, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to
collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of the
Securities of any series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in
accordance with the provisions of the Securities of such series and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent
(including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of Securities of such series, of all sums due and to
become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but
money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the
extent required by law.

     The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or
other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations
deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in
respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge that by law is for
the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.

     Anything in this Article Thirteen to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company
Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in
Section 1304 with respect to Securities of any series that, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the
amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an
equivalent Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Securities of
such series.

Section 1306.  Reinstatement.

     If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in
accordance with this Article Thirteen with respect to the Securities of any
series by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the
Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of such series
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to
this Article Thirteen with respect to Securities of such series until such time
as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust
pursuant to Section 1305 with respect to Securities of such series in accordance
with this Article Thirteen; provided, however, that if the Company makes any
payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such
series following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series to receive
such payment from the money so held in trust.

                   REDEMPTION AT OPTION OF SECURITY HOLDERS

Section 1401.  Applicability of Article.

     Securities of any series which are redeemable at the option of the Holders
thereof before their Stated Maturity shall be repaid in accordance with their
terms and (except as otherwise contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of
such series) in accordance with this Article.

Section 1402.  Redemption of Securities.

     Each Security which is subject to redemption in whole or in part at the
option of the Holder thereof on a Repayment Date shall be repaid at the
applicable Repayment Price together with interest accrued to such Repayment Date
as specified pursuant to Section 301.

Section 1403.  Exercise of Option; Notice.

     Other than as otherwise set forth in an Officers' Certificate pursuant to
Section 301 hereof, each Holder desiring to exercise his option for redemption
shall, as conditions to such redemption surrender the Security to be repaid
together with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the
Repayment Date and with written notice of the exercise of such option at any
office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment, not less than 15 nor more
than 30 days prior to the Repayment Date. Such notice, which shall be
irrevocable, shall identify the Security to be repaid and shall specify the
principal amount of such Security to be repaid, which shall be not less than the
minimum authorized denomination for such Security or an integral multiple
thereof and, in the case of a partial redemption of the Security, the
denomination or denominations of the Security or Securities with Equivalent
Principal Terms to be issued to the Holder for the portion of the principal of
the Security surrendered which is not to be repaid.

     Any Security which is to be repaid only in part shall be surrendered at a
Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due
endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service
charge, a new Security or Securities with Equivalent Principal Terms, of any
authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of
the Security so surrendered.

     For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the
case of any Security repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the
principal of such Security which has been or is to be repaid.

Section 1404.  Securities Payable on the Repayment Date.

     Notice of exercise of the option of repayment having been given and the
Securities so to be repaid having been surrendered as aforesaid, such Securities
shall, on the Repayment Date, become due and payable at the Repayment Price
therein specified and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default
in the payment of Repayment Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall
cease to bear interest.  Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in
accordance with Section 1403, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the
Repayment Price, together with accrued interest to the Repayment Date; provided,
however, that, installments of interest on Securities whose Stated Maturity is
on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 307.  Any security surrendered by the Holder to the
Company for redemption pursuant to this Article Fourteen shall be surrendered by
the Company to the Trustee for cancellation.

     If any Security duly surrendered for redemption shall not be so paid, the
principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment
Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.

     This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts

Indenture, dated as of March 1, 1997 (the "Indenture") between the Company and
First Trust of California, National Association, as Trustee, four series of debt
securities of the Company are hereby established, each with the following
respective terms and provisions:

I.   7.125% Senior Notes due 2004.

     1.   The title of such series of Securities shall be the "7.125% Senior
Notes due 2004" (the "2004 Notes").  The price at which the 2004 Notes shall be
issued is 99.825%.
 
     2.   The aggregate principal amount of the 2004 Notes that may be
authenticated and delivered under the Indenture shall be $200,000,000 (except
for 2004 Notes authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer of, or
in exchange for, or in lieu of, other 2004 Notes pursuant to Sections 304, 305,
306, 906 and 1007 of the Indenture, and except for any 2004 Notes which,
pursuant to Section 303 of the Indenture, shall be deemed never to have been
authenticated and delivered thereunder).

     3.   Interest on the 2004 Notes shall be payable to the Persons in whose
names the 2004 Notes (or one or more Predecessor Securities) are registered at
the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.

     4.   The Stated Maturity of the 2004 Notes on which the principal thereof
is due and payable is March 1, 2004.

     5.   The 2004 Notes shall bear interest at 7.125% per annum from March 1,

the Person in whose name the 2004 Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities)
are registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest, which shall initially be February 15 or August 15 (as the case may

<PAGE>
 
Business Day, immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date. Interest on the
2004 Notes shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.

     6.   The 2004 Notes shall be issued in the form of one Global Note (the
"Global 2004 Note").  So long as the 2004 Notes shall be issued in whole in the
form of the Global 2004 Note, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest,
if any, on the 2004 Notes shall be paid in immediately available funds to the
Depositary or a nominee of the Depositary.  If at any time the 2004 Notes are no
longer represented by the Global 2004 Note and are issued in definitive form
("Certificated 2004 Notes"), then the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest, if any, on each Certificated 2004 Note at Maturity shall be paid to
the Holder upon surrender of such Certificated 2004 Note at the office or agency
maintained by the Company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York
(which shall initially be the office of First Trust of New York, National
Association, an Affiliate of the Trustee) or the principal office of First Trust
National Association, an Affiliate of the Trustee, in St. Paul, Minnesota,
provided that such Certificated 2004 Note is surrendered to the Trustee, acting

funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Payments of interest with
respect to Certificated 2004 Notes other than at Maturity may, at the option of
the Company, be made by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled
thereto as it appears on the Security Register on the relevant Regular Record
Date or by wire transfer in same day funds to such account as may have been
appropriately designated to the Paying Agent by such Person in writing not later
than such relevant Regular Record Date.  Each payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest, if any, shall be made in such coin or currency of the United
States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of
public and private debts. Transfer of the 2004 Notes shall be registrable on the
Securities Register upon the surrender of the 2004 Notes for registration of
transfer at the office or agency maintained by the Company in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York (which shall initially be the office of First

first-class mail at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the
Redemption Date, at the option of the Company at any time, as a whole or in
part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of their principal
amount, plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date or (ii) the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest
thereon discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-
day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield plus ten (10)
basis points.

          "Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate

such Redemption Date.

          "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security
selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to
the remaining term of the 2004 Notes that would be utilized, at the time of

issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining term
of the 2004 Notes.  "Independent Investment Banker" means Morgan Stanley & Co.

Bank of New York and designated "Composite 3:30 p.m. Quotations for U.S.
Government Securities" or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not
published or does not contain such prices on such Business Day, (A) the average
of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after
excluding the highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or
(B) if the Trustee obtains fewer than four such Reference Treasury Dealer
Quotations, the average of all such Quotations.  "Reference Treasury Dealer
Quotations" means, with respect to each Reference Treasury Dealer and any
Redemption Date, the average as determined by the Trustee of the bid and asked
prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage
of its principal amount) quoted in writing to the Trustee by such Reference
Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m. on the third Business Day preceding such Redemption
Date.

          "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) each of Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated and  Goldman, Sachs & Co. and their respective successors;

Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any
other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with
the Company.

     In the event that the Company elects to redeem the 2004 Notes at a
Redemption Price determined as provided in clause (ii) of the first paragraph of
this Section 7, the Trustee shall, instead of specifying the Redemption Price in
such redemption notice, specify the manner in which the Redemption Price shall
be calculated under this Section 7 and provide a numerical example of such
calculation in the manner set forth above using the date of the notice of
redemption instead of the Redemption Date.

provisions.  The 2004 Notes will not be redeemable at the option of the Holder
thereof prior to Maturity.

"Indenture"), between the Company and First Trust of California, National
Association, as Trustee (herein called the "Trustee", which term includes any
successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures
supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective
rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company,
the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one
of the series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate principal
amount to $__________.

     The Securities of this series are subject to redemption upon receipt of
notice by first-class mail at least 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to
the Redemption Date, at the option of the Company at any time, as a whole or in
part, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of their principal
amount plus accrued interest to the Redemption Date or (ii) the sum of the
present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest
hereon discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-
day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Yield plus ten (10)
basis points.

     "Treasury Yield" means, with respect to any Redemption Date, the rate per

     "Comparable Treasury Issue" means the United States Treasury security
selected by an Independent Investment Banker as having a maturity comparable to
the remaining term of the Securities of this series that would be utilized, at
the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial practice, in
pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the
remaining term of the Securities of this series.  "Independent Investment
Banker" means Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or, if such firm is unwilling or

Government Securities" or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not
published or does not contain such prices on such Business Day, (A) the average
of the Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Redemption Date, after

Trustee of the bid and asked prices for the Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed

preceding such redemption date.

     "Reference Treasury Dealer" means (i) each of Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and their respective successors, provided,
however, that if any of the foregoing shall cease to be a primary U.S.
Government securities dealer in New York City (a "Primary Treasury Dealer"), the
Company shall substitute therefor another Primary Treasury Dealer; and (ii) any
other Primary Treasury Dealer selected by the Trustee after consultation with
the Company.

     Interest installments whose due date is on or prior to such Redemption Date
will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor
Securities, of record at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates
referred to on the face hereof, all as provided in the Indenture.

     In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a new Security or
Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof
will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

of the Holder prior to their Stated Maturity.

     If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series shall
occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

   The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at
the time Outstanding of each series to be affected.  The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the
Holders of Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with
certain provisions of the Indenture and certain defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences.  Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security
shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of
this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer

Thirteen of the Indenture shall apply to this Security.

of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is

authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities of this series
and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate
principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

     The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.  As
provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth,
Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount
of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized
denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

     No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

     Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the
Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the
Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the

the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.
