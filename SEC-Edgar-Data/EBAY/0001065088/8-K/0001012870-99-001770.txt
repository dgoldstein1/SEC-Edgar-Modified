Item 2.  Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

     On May 18, 1999, eBay Inc. ("eBay") completed a series of acquisitions in
which it acquired Kruse, Inc. (d/b/a Kruse International), Auburn Cordage, Inc.,
ACD Auto Sales, Inc., Reppert School of Auctioneering, Inc. and Classic
Advertising & Promotions, Inc., each an Indiana corporation (collectively, the
"Companies").  The Companies were acquired pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 17, 1999 (the "Merger Agreement"),
among eBay, each of the Companies, five merger subsidiaries wholly-owned by
eBay, Dean V. Kruse and Mitchell Kruse.  Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, each
Company was merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay, with the respective
Company as the surviving corporation (collectively, the "Mergers").  As a result
of the Mergers, each Company became a wholly owed subsidiary of eBay.  In
connection with the Mergers, eBay issued a total of 787,312 shares of eBay
common stock to the existing shareholders of the Companies as consideration for
all shares of capital stock of the Companies.

     The Mergers are intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and to be
accounted for as a "pooling of interests."  The Companies conduct auctions and
provide appraisal services for merchandise, primarily automobiles, offered at
such auctions.  eBay intends to continue to use the assets acquired to conduct
such business.

Item 7.  Financial Statements and Exhibits.

     a.  The required financial statements will be filed by amendment as soon
         as practicable.

     b.  The required pro forma financial information will be filed by amendment
          as soon as practicable.

     c.  Exhibits

     Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument delivered to the Selling
     Stockholders);

          (d)  by the Selling Stockholders' Agent if the Closing has not taken
     place on or before July 31, 1999 (other than as a result of the failure on
     the part of any of the Companies or any of the Selling Stockholders to
     comply with or perform any covenant or obligation set forth in this
     Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument delivered to Parent); or

          (e)  by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Selling
     Stockholders' Agent.

     8.2  Termination Procedures.  If Parent wishes to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(c), Parent shall deliver to the
Selling Stockholders' Agent a written notice stating that Parent is terminating
this Agreement and setting forth a brief description of the basis on which
Parent is terminating this Agreement. If the Selling Stockholders' Agent wishes

stating that the Selling Stockholders' Agent (on behalf of the Selling

SECTION 9.   INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

     9.1  Survival of Representations, Etc.

          (a)  Except as set forth in Section 9.2(c), the representations and
warranties made by the Companies and the Selling Stockholders (including the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2) shall survive the Closing
and shall expire on the first anniversary of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that if, at any time prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, any Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the Selling
Stockholders' Agent a written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in
or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the Selling
Stockholders (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such
Indemnitee's belief that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and asserting a
claim for recovery under Section 9.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach,
then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the first anniversary of
the Closing until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved. All
representations and warranties made by Parent and each Merger Sub shall
terminate and expire as of the Closing Date, and any

                                      29.
<PAGE>

liability of Parent or any Merger Sub with respect to such representations and
warranties shall thereupon cease.

          (b)  The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of the
Companies and the Selling Stockholders, and the rights and remedies that may be
exercised by the Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or
as a result of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or
knowledge of, any of the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

          (c)  For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or other item of
information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or in any update to the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty made by
the Companies and the Selling Stockholders in this Agreement.

     9.2  Indemnification by Selling Stockholders.

          (a)  From and after the Closing Date (but subject to Section 9.1(a)),
the Selling Stockholders, jointly and severally, shall hold harmless and
indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and
reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any third-party claim) and that arise from or as a result of,
or are directly or indirectly connected with: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of
any representation or warranty set forth in Section 2 (without giving effect to
any "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality qualification or any similar
qualification contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in such
representation or warranty, and without giving effect to any update to the
Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Companies to Parent prior to the Closing);
(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth in
Section 2 as if such representation and warranty had been made on and as of the
Closing Date (without giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect" or other
materiality qualification or any similar qualification contained or incorporated
directly or indirectly in such representation or warranty, but giving effect to
any update to the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Companies to Parent prior
to the Closing to the extent that Parent would be entitled to terminate this
Agreement as a result of such update); (iii) any breach of any covenant or
obligation of any of the Companies or any of the Selling Stockholders (including
the covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 5); or (iv) any Legal Proceeding
relating to any inaccuracy or breach of the type referred to in clause "(i),"
"(ii)" or "(iii)" above (including any Legal Proceeding commenced by any
Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this Section 9).

          (b)  Deductible.  Except for claims under Section 9.2(c), the Selling
Stockholders shall not be required to make any indemnification payment pursuant
to Section 9.2(a) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any of their
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2 until such time as the
total amount of all Damages (including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy
or breach and all other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies in or
breaches of any representations or warranties) that have been directly or
indirectly suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to
which any one or more of the Indemnitees

                                      30.
<PAGE>

has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds $300,000 in the aggregate. (If the
total amount of such Damages exceeds $300,000, then the Indemnitees shall be
entitled to be indemnified against and compensated and reimbursed only for the
portion of such Damages exceeding $300,000.)

          (c)  Form 8300 Filing Indemnity.  From and after the Closing Date, the
Selling Stockholders, jointly and severally, shall hold harmless and indemnify
each of the Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate and reimburse
each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or indirectly
suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the
Indemnitees may otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such
Damages relate to any third-party claim) and that arise from or as a result of,
or are directly or indirectly connected with the claims by the Internal Revenue
Service that the Companies failed to make required Form 8300 filings in the
years 1990, 1991 and 1992.

     9.3  Exclusive Remedy.

          (a)  Except as provided in Section 9.3(b), and with the exception of
claims based upon fraud, from and after the Closing, recourse of Parent to the
shares of Parent common stock held in escrow pursuant Section 1.3(ii) and the
Escrow Agreement (the 10% Escrow) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent and the other Indemnitees for monetary damages for any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement.

          (b)  Recourse for claims made under Section 9.2(c) shall first be to
the shares of Parent common stock held in escrow pursuant Section 1.3(iii) and
the Escrow Agreement (the Form 8300 Escrow) but such claims shall not be limited
to such escrowed shares.

     9.4  Satisfaction of Indemnification Claim.  In the event any Selling
Stockholder shall have any liability (for indemnification or otherwise) to any
Indemnitee under this Section 9 that can be satisfied by recourse against escrow
shares, such Selling Stockholder shall satisfy such liability by delivering to
such Indemnitee the number of shares of Parent common stock determined by
dividing (a) the aggregate dollar amount of such liability by (b) the Calculated
Stock Price (as adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction
effected by Parent between the Closing Date and the date such liability is
satisfied).

     9.5  No Contribution.  Each Selling Stockholder waives, and acknowledges
and agrees that he shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt
to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against any Surviving Corporation in connection with any
indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he may become subject
under or in connection with this Agreement.

                                      31.
<PAGE>

     9.6  Defense of Third Party Claims.  In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against any
Surviving Corporation, against Parent or against any other Person) with respect
to which any of the Selling Stockholders may become obligated to hold harmless,
indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9,
Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense of
such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own.  If Parent so proceeds with the
defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

          (a)  all reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or
     Legal Proceeding shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Selling
     Stockholders;

          (b)  each Selling Stockholder shall make available to Parent any
     documents and materials in his or its possession or control that may be
     necessary to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

          (c)  Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such
     claim or Legal Proceeding with the consent of the Selling Stockholders'
     Agent (as defined in Section 10.1); provided, however, that such consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Parent shall give the Selling Stockholders' Agent prompt notice of the
commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent or any Surviving
Corporation; provided, however, any failure on the part of Parent to so notify
the Selling Stockholders' Agent shall not limit any of the obligations of the
Selling Stockholders under this Section 9 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding).  If Parent does not
elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding, the
Selling Stockholders' Agent may proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided, however,
that the Selling Stockholders' Agent may not settle, adjust or compromise any
such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld).

SECTION 10.  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

     10.1 Selling Stockholders' Agent.  The Selling Stockholders hereby
irrevocably appoint Dean V. Kruse as their agent for purposes of Sections 7, 8
and 9 (the "Selling Stockholders' Agent"), and Dean V. Kruse hereby accepts his
appointment as the Selling Stockholders' Agent.  Parent shall be entitled to
deal exclusively with the Selling Stockholders' Agent on the matters indicated
in Sections 7 and 8 and on all matters relating to Section 9, and shall be
entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever)
on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Selling
Stockholder by the Selling Stockholders' Agent, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Selling Stockholder by the Selling
Stockholders' Agent, as fully binding upon such Selling Stockholder.  If the
Selling Stockholders' Agent shall die, become disabled or otherwise be unable to
fulfill his responsibilities as agent of the Selling Stockholders, then the
Selling Stockholders shall, within ten days after such death or disability,
appoint a successor agent and, promptly thereafter, shall notify Parent of the
identity of such successor.  Any such successor shall become the "Selling
Stockholders' Agent" for purposes of Sections 7, 8 and 9 and this

affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

     1.  Representations and Warranties of Affiliate.  Affiliate represents and
warrants to Parent as follows:

         (a)  Affiliate is the holder and beneficial owner of the number of
outstanding shares of common stock of each of the Companies set forth beneath
Affiliate's signature on the signature page hereof (collectively, the "Company
Shares"), and Affiliate has good and valid title to the Company Shares, free and
clear of any liens, pledges, security interests, adverse claims, equities,
options, proxies, charges, encumbrances or restrictions of any nature. Affiliate
has the sole right to vote and to dispose of the Company Shares.

         (b)  Affiliate does not own any options or other rights to purchase
shares of common stock of any of the Companies or any other securities of any of
the Companies, other than the Company Shares.

         (c)  Affiliate has carefully read this Affiliate Agreement and, to the
extent Affiliate felt necessary, has discussed with counsel the limitations
imposed on Affiliate's ability to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the
Company Shares or the shares of Parent Common Stock that Affiliate is to receive
in the Mergers (the "Parent Shares"). Affiliate fully understands the
limitations this Affiliate Agreement places upon Affiliate's ability to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of securities of the Companies and securities of
Parent.

         (d)  Affiliate understands that the representations, warranties and
covenants set forth in this Affiliate Agreement will be relied upon by Parent
and its counsel and accountants for purposes of determining Parent's eligibility
to account for the Merger as a "pooling of interests" and for purposes of
determining whether Parent should proceed with the Mergers.

     2.  Prohibitions Against Transfer.  Affiliate agrees that, during the
period from the date hereof through the date on which financial results covering
at least 30 days of post-Merger combined operations of Parent and the Companies
have been published by Parent (within the meaning of the applicable "pooling of
interests" accounting requirements):

         (a) Affiliate shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or
     reduce Affiliate's interest in or risk relating to, any capital stock of
     any of the Companies, except pursuant to and upon consummation of the
     Mergers; and

         (b) Affiliate shall not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or
     reduce Affiliate's interest in or risk relating to, (A) any shares of
     capital stock of Parent (including without limitation the Parent Shares and
     any additional shares of capital stock of Parent acquired by Affiliate,
     whether upon exercise of a stock option or otherwise), or (B) any option or
     other right to purchase any shares of capital stock of Parent; except in

     3.  Independence of Obligations. The covenants and obligations of Affiliate
set forth in this Affiliate Agreement shall be construed as independent of any
other agreement or arrangement between Affiliate, on the one hand, and any
Company or Parent, on the other. The existence of any claim or cause of action
by Affiliate against any Company or Parent shall not constitute a defense to the
enforcement of any of such covenants or obligations against Affiliate.

     4.  Specific Performance.  Affiliate agrees that in the event of any breach
or threatened breach by Affiliate of any covenant, obligation or other provision
contained in this Affiliate Agreement, Parent shall be entitled (in addition to

specific performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of
such covenant, obligation or other provision; and (b) an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. Affiliate further agrees that neither Parent
nor any other person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this Section 4, and Affiliate irrevocably waives any right
he may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or
similar instrument.

     5.  Other Agreements.  Nothing in this Affiliate Agreement shall limit any
of the rights or remedies of Parent under the Merger Agreement, or any of the
rights or remedies of Parent or any of the obligations of Affiliate under any
agreement between Affiliate and Parent or any certificate or instrument executed
by Affiliate in favor of Parent; and nothing in the Merger Agreement or in any
other agreement, certificate or instrument shall limit any of the rights or
remedies of Parent or any of the obligations of Affiliate under this Affiliate
Agreement.

power, right, privilege or remedy under this Affiliate Agreement, and no delay
on the part of Parent in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Affiliate Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right,
privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right,

waived any claim arising out of this Affiliate Agreement, or any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Affiliate Agreement, unless the waiver of such
claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written

                                      1.

<PAGE>

         (a)  The Stockholder is the holder and beneficial owner of the Shares
and has good and valid title to the Shares free and clear of any Encumbrances.
The Shares are the only shares of the capital stock of any of the Companies held
by the Stockholder. The Stockholder has the ability to vote all of the
respective Shares at any meeting of the stockholders of the applicable Company
or by written consent in lieu of any such meeting. Except pursuant to the Merger

         (b)  The Stockholder has the absolute and unrestricted right, power,
authority and capacity to enter into, execute, deliver and perform all of his
obligations under the Merger Agreement and under each other agreement, document
or instrument referred to in or contemplated by the Merger Agreement to which
the Stockholder is or is to become a party.

         (c)  The Merger Agreement and each other agreement, document or
instrument referred to in or contemplated by the Merger Agreement to which the
Stockholder is or is to become a party (i) has been (or will when executed by
the Stockholder be) duly and validly executed by the Stockholder, and (ii)
constitutes (or will when executed by the Stockholder constitute) a valid and
binding obligation of the Stockholder, enforceable against the Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating to
bankruptcy, insolvency and the relief of debtors, and to rules of law governing
specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies.

         (d)  Neither the execution, delivery or performance of the Merger
Agreement or of any other agreement, document or instrument referred to in or
contemplated by the Merger Agreement to which the Stockholder is or is to become
a party, nor the consummation of the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, will directly or indirectly: (i) result in
any violation or breach of any agreement or other instrument to which the
Stockholder is a party or by which the Stockholder is bound; or (ii) result in a
violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the
Stockholder or any of the Shares is subject. No authorization, consent or
approval of, or notice to, any Person is required to be obtained or given by the
Stockholder in connection with the execution, delivery or performance of the
Merger Agreement or of any other agreement, document or instrument referred to
in or contemplated by the Merger Agreement to which the Stockholder is or is to
become a party.

         (e)  There is no Legal Proceeding by or before any Governmental Body
pending or, to the knowledge of the Stockholder, threatened against the
Stockholder that challenges or would challenge the execution and delivery of the
Merger Agreement or of any other agreement, document or instrument referred to
in or contemplated by the Merger Agreement to which the Stockholder is or is to
become a party or the taking of any of the actions required to be taken by the
Stockholder under the Merger Agreement or under any other agreement, document or
instrument referred to in or contemplated by the Merger Agreement to which the
Stockholder is or is to become a party.

         (f)  The Stockholder is aware (i) that the Parent Common Stock to be
issued to the Stockholder in the Mergers will not be issued pursuant to a
registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"),
but will instead be issued in reliance on the

                                      2.
<PAGE>

exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(2) of the Act and in
Regulation D under the Act, and (ii) that neither the Mergers nor the issuance
of such Parent Common Stock has been approved or reviewed by the SEC or by any
other Governmental Body.

         (g)  The Stockholder is aware that the Parent Common Stock to be issued
in the Mergers cannot be resold unless such Parent Common Stock is registered
under the Act or unless an exemption from registration is available. The
Stockholder is also aware that: (i) except pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, Parent is under no obligation to file a
registration statement with respect to the Parent Common Stock to be issued to
the Stockholder in the Mergers; and (ii) the provisions of Rule 144 under the
Act will permit resale of the Parent Common Stock to be issued to the
Stockholder in the Mergers only under limited circumstances, and such Parent
Common Stock must be held by the Stockholder for at least one year before it can
be sold pursuant to Rule 144.

         (h)  The Parent Common Stock to be issued to the Stockholder in the
Mergers will be acquired by the Stockholder for investment and for his own
account, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
unregistered distribution thereof.

         (i)  The Stockholder has received and examined Parent's Final
Prospectus dated September 24, 1998, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 30, 1998, Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1998 and Final Prospectus dated April 12, 1999, including the risk
factors described therein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Stockholder specifically acknowledges that the stock price of Parent Common
Stock has been, and will likely continue to be, extremely volatile, and the
Stockholder unconditionally and forever waives and discharges any rights he may
have against Parent or any other Person relating to any changes in the price of
Parent Common Stock.

         (j)  The Stockholder has been given the opportunity: (i) to ask
questions of, and to receive answers from, persons acting on behalf of the
Companies and Parent concerning the terms and conditions of the Mergers and the
contemplated issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Mergers, and the business,
properties, prospects and financial condition of the Companies and Parent; and
(ii) to obtain any additional information (to the extent the Companies or Parent
possesses such information or is able to acquire it without unreasonable effort
or expense and without breach of confidentiality obligations) that is necessary
to verify the accuracy of the information set forth in the documents, provided
or made available to the Stockholder.

         (k)  The Stockholder is knowledgeable, sophisticated and experienced in
making, and is qualified to make, decisions with respect to investments in
securities presenting investment decisions like that involved in the
Stockholder's contemplated investment in the Parent Common Stock to be issued in
the Mergers.

         (l)  The Stockholder is an "accredited investor" (as such term is
defined in Rule 501 under the Act).

         (m)  The Stockholder understands that stop transfer instructions will
be given to Parent's transfer agent with respect to the Parent Common Stock to
be issued to the Stockholder in the Mergers, and that there will be placed on
the certificate or certificates

                                      3.
<PAGE>

representing such Parent Common Stock a legend identical or similar in effect to
the following legend (together with any other legend or legends required by
applicable state securities laws or otherwise):

     "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
     UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED,
     SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED
     UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
     REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT IS AVAILABLE."

     2.  RELIANCE.  The Stockholder acknowledges that Parent will rely on his
representations, warranties and certifications set forth in Section 1 above for
purposes of determining his suitability as an investor in Parent Common Stock
and for purposes of confirming the availability of an exemption from the
registration requirements of the Act.

     3.  PROHIBITIONS AGAINST TRANSFER.  The Stockholder shall not effect any
sale, transfer or other disposition of any of the Parent Common Stock that he is
to receive in the Mergers unless:

         (a)  such sale, transfer or other disposition has been registered under
the Act;

         (b)  such sale, transfer or other disposition is made in conformity
with the requirements of Rule 144 under the Act, as evidenced by a broker's
letter and a representation letter executed by the Stockholder (satisfactory in
form and content to Parent) stating that such requirements have been met;

         (c)  counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall have advised
Parent in a written opinion letter (satisfactory in form and content to Parent),
upon which Parent may rely, that such sale, transfer or other disposition will
be exempt from registration under the Act; or

         (d)  an authorized representative of the SEC shall have rendered
written advice to the Stockholder to the effect that the SEC would take no
action, or that the staff of the SEC would not recommend that the SEC take
action, with respect to such sale, transfer or other disposition, and a copy of
such written advice and all other related communications with the SEC shall have
been delivered to Parent.

                                      4.

     B.  Parent has agreed to provide the Stockholders with certain registration
rights as more fully described herein.

                                   AGREEMENT

     The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

                           SECTION 1:  Registration

     1.1  Registerable Shares.  As used in this Agreement, "Registerable Shares"
means the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to the Stockholders pursuant to
the Merger Agreement and any shares of Parent Common Stock issued in respect
thereof as a result of any stock split, stock dividend, share exchange, merger,
consolidation or similar recapitalization; provided, however, that Registerable
Shares shall cease to be Registerable Shares when (i) a registration statement
covering such Registerable Shares shall have become effective under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and such Registerable
Shares shall have been disposed of in accordance with such registration
statement, or (ii) such Registerable Shares may be transferred pursuant to Rule
144 under the 1933 Act, as such rule may be amended from time to time, or any
successor rule or regulation ("Rule 144"); and provided further, that
Registerable Shares shall not include any shares of Parent Common Stock held in
any "Escrow Account"
<PAGE>

pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (as defined in the Merger Agreement).
Stockholders desiring to sell shares pursuant to Rule 144 shall provide such
Rule 144 representation letters in usual and customary form as may reasonably be
requested by Parent's counsel to provide a Rule 144 opinion.

1.2  Registration.

          (a)  On or prior to September 30, 1999, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, Parent shall prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC") a registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration
Statement") covering the resale of _______ [number of shares issued to
Stockholders, excluding escrow shares] of the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued to the Stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement and any shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in respect thereof as a result of any stock split,
stock dividend, share exchange, merger, consolidation or similar
recapitalization after the Closing Date (the "Registerable Shares"). Parent
shall use its reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared
effective on or before October 31, 1999, but shall be under no obligation to
have such Registration Statement declared effective prior to the second trading
day after its announcement of its quarterly financial results for the quarter
ended September 30, 1999.

          (b)  The Stockholders shall furnish such information as Parent may
reasonably request in connection with the preparation of the Registration
Statement. Upon registration of the resale of the Registerable Shares with the
SEC pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Registerable Shares may be sold
in accordance with the Registration Statement under the 1933 Act. Parent shall
use its reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to remain
effective until the earliest of (i) the date on which all Registerable Shares
covered by the Registration Statement have been sold to the public pursuant to
the Registration Statement, (ii) one year after the effective date of the
Registration Statement and (iii) the date on which all of the Registerable
Shares may be sold in any 3-month period pursuant to Rule 144.

     1.3  Other Shares.  Parent may include in the Registration Statement
referred to in Section 1.2 any other shares of Parent Common Stock (including
issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as to which the holders
thereof have contracted with Parent for "piggyback" registration rights).

                       SECTION 2:  Parent's Obligations

          In connection with the Registration Statement referred to in Section
1.2, Parent shall:

     2.1  Registration Statement.  Prepare and file with the SEC a registration
statement with respect to the Registerable Shares and thereafter use its
reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain
effective for the period set forth in Section 1.2(b).

     2.2  Amendments and Supplements.  Prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement and the prospectus used
in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement
effective for the period set forth in Section 1.2(b) and to comply with the
provisions of the 1933 Act with respect to the sale or other disposition of the
shares of Parent Common Stock covered by the Registration Statement.

                                      2.
<PAGE>

     2.3  Copies of Offering Documents.  Furnish to the Stockholders such
numbers of copies of the Registration Statement, prospectus, and any amendments
and supplements thereto, in conformity with the requirements of the 1933 Act,
such documents incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement and such
other documents as the Stockholders reasonably request, in order to facilitate
the public sale or other disposition of the Registerable Shares.

     2.4  Misleading Prospectus.  Promptly notify each Stockholder, at any time
when the prospectus relating thereto covered by the Registration Statement is
required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, upon Parent becoming aware that the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes
an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading in the light of the circumstances then existing, and immediately
thereafter use reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC and furnish
to such Stockholder a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an
amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such Registerable Shares, such prospectus shall
not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in the light of the circumstances under which they are made.

     2.5  Rule 144.  Use its reasonable efforts to file in a timely manner any
reports required to be filed by it under the 1933 Act and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and take such further action
as the Stockholders may reasonably request, all from time to time to enable each
such Stockholder to sell the Registerable Shares owned by him (and any shares of
Parent Common Stock deposited in escrow on his behalf pursuant to the Merger
Agreement that are released from escrow to such Stockholder) without
registration under the 1933 Act pursuant to the exemption provided by Rule 144.

     2.6  Blue Sky Filings.  Use its reasonable efforts to register and qualify
the securities covered by the Registration Statement under the Blue Sky laws of
such jurisdictions as shall be reasonably requested by the Stockholders,
provided that Parent shall not be required in connection therewith or as a
condition thereto to qualify to do business or to file a general consent to
service of process in any such states or jurisdictions.

                   SECTION 3:  The Stockholder's Obligations

     In connection with the Registration Statement referred to in Section 1.2,
the Stockholders shall each:

     3.1  Other Documents and Information.  Complete, execute, acknowledge
and/or deliver such questionnaires, indemnification agreements, custody
agreements, underwriting agreements (if the registration is underwritten) and
other documents, certificates and instruments as are reasonably required by
Parent or any underwriter(s) or are otherwise necessary in connection with the
registration and offering. Each Stockholder shall promptly provide to Parent
such information concerning such Stockholder, his ownership of Parent's
securities, the intended method of distribution and such other information as
may be required by applicable law or regulation or as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.

                                      3.
<PAGE>

     3.2  Cessation of Offering.  Upon receipt of any notice from Parent of the
happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.4, immediately
discontinue disposition of the Registerable Shares pursuant to the Registration
Statement covering such shares until the Stockholders' receipt of the copies of
the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section 2.4, and, if so
directed by Parent, deliver to Parent all copies of the prospectus covering such
Registerable Shares in such Stockholder's possession at the time of receipt of
such notice.

     3.3  No Preliminary Prospectus.  No Stockholder and no person or entity
acting on any Stockholder's behalf (other than an underwriter selected by Parent
or approved by Parent) shall offer any Registerable Shares by means of any
preliminary prospectus.

                            SECTION 4:  Limitations

     4.1  Other Transactions.  Parent shall not be obligated to effect a
registration pursuant to Section 1, or to file any amendment or supplement
thereto, and may suspend the Stockholders' rights to make sales pursuant to an
effective registration pursuant to Section 1, at any time when Parent, in the
good faith judgment of its Board of Directors, reasonably believes that the
filing thereof at the time requested, or the offering of securities pursuant
thereto, would (i) materially and adversely affect a pending or proposed
acquisition, merger, recapitalization, consolidation, reorganization or similar
transaction, or negotiations, discussions or pending proposals related thereto,
or (ii) be seriously detrimental to Parent and its stockholders, in which event
(under clause (i) or (ii) above) Parent's sole relief from its registration
obligations is the right to defer filing of the Registration Statement (or to
suspend the Stockholders' rights to make sales pursuant to the Registration
Statement if it is already effective) for a period of not more than 60 days;
provided, however, that Parent shall not utilize the right described in this
Section 4.1 more than twice in any 12-month period.

                   SECTION 5:  Expenses and Indemnification

     5.1  Certain Fees and Commissions.  Parent shall pay its own general legal
and accounting fees and all printing fees in connection with the Registration
Statement. Parent shall reimburse the Stockholders, in the aggregate, up to a
total of $5,000 for reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the Stockholders
in connection with the initial preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement and up to $2,500 for reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the
Stockholders in connection with any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement. The Stockholders shall pay any additional fees and costs of their own
counsel and all underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses of underwriters
or brokers incurred in connection with the offering and sale of the Registerable
Shares.

     5.2  Other Expenses.  Parent shall pay all registration and filing fees
attributable to the Registerable Shares and the listing fee payable to the
Nasdaq National Market.

     5.3  Indemnification.  In the event any Registerable Shares are included in
a registration statement under Section 1:

          (a)  Indemnification by Parent.  To the extent permitted by law,
Parent will indemnify and hold harmless each Stockholder, such Stockholder's
heirs, successors and assigns, any underwriter (as defined in the 1933 Act) for
such Stockholder (if selected by Parent or

                                      5.
<PAGE>

approved by Parent), and each person, if any, who controls such Stockholder or
underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, against any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions to which they may become subject
under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other federal or state law, arising out of
or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in such registration statement, including any preliminary
prospectus (not prohibited by Section 3.3) or final prospectus contained therein
or any amendments or supplements thereto, or arising out of or based upon the
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the context in
which made, not misleading; and Parent will reimburse each such Stockholder,
such Stockholder's heirs, successors and assigns, underwriter (if selected by
Parent or approved by Parent) or controlling person for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action; provided, however,
that the indemnification and other rights provided for in this Section 5.3(a)
shall not apply (i) to any such loss, claim, damage, liability, or action
insofar as it arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration
statement, preliminary prospectus or final prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished expressly for use in connection with such registration by any
Stockholder or (ii) if the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action who purchased the Registerable Shares that are the subject
thereof did not receive a copy of an amended preliminary prospectus or the final
prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented) at or prior to
the written confirmation of the sale of such Registerable Shares to such person
because of the failure of such Stockholder or underwriter to so provide such
amended preliminary or final prospectus and the untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact made in such
preliminary prospectus was corrected in the amended preliminary prospectus or
the final prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended and supplemented). Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of such Stockholder, underwriter or controlling person and
shall survive the transfer of the Registerable Shares by such Stockholder.

          (b)  Indemnification by Stockholders.  To the extent permitted by law,
each Stockholder will severally (but not jointly and pro rata with the other
Stockholders) indemnify and hold harmless Parent, its successors and assigns,
its officers and directors, any underwriter (as defined in the 1933 Act) with
respect to the Registerable Shares, and each person, if any, who controls Parent
or any such underwriter within the meaning of the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act,
against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions (joint or several)
to which they may become subject under the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or other
federal or state law, arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in such registration
statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, or arising out of or based
upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the context
in which made, not misleading; provided that such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished by such Stockholder expressly
for use in such registration by such Stockholder, or (ii) the failure of such
Stockholder or any underwriter with respect to the Registerable Shares held by
such Stockholder at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of the
Registerable Shares held by such Stockholder to send

                                      5.
<PAGE>

or arrange delivery of a copy of an amended preliminary prospectus or the final
prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended or supplemented) to the person
asserting any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action who purchased the
Registerable Shares which is the subject thereof and the untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact made
in such preliminary prospectus was corrected in the amended preliminary
prospectus or the final prospectus (or the final prospectus as amended and
supplemented). Each Stockholder will reimburse Parent and each such officer or
director or controlling person for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability, or action. Such indemnity shall remain in full force
and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of Parent or any
such officer, director, underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the
transfer of the Registerable Shares by such Stockholder.

          (c)  Indemnification Procedures.  Promptly after receipt by a person
who may be entitled to indemnification under this Section 5.3 (an "indemnified
party") of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental
action) for which indemnification may be available under this Section 5.3, such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any
person who must provide indemnification under this Section 5.3 (an "indemnifying
party"), deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the commencement
thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and,
to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof with
counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an
indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel (and the
reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid by the indemnifying party) and
assume its own defense if (i) the retention of such counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party, (ii) the
indemnifying party has failed to promptly assume the defense and employ
experienced counsel reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party after the
indemnifying party has received the notice of the indemnification matter from
the indemnified party, or (iii) the named parties to any such action include
both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to a conflict of
interest between them. It is understood, however, that the indemnifying party
shall not, in connection with any one such action or separate but substantially
similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys for all
indemnified parties unless the indemnified parties in good faith conclude and
are advised by their counsel that there is an actual or potential conflict of
interest among the indemnified parties. No indemnification provided for in
Section 5.3(a) or Section 5.3(b) shall be available to any party who shall fail
to give notice as provided in this Section 5.3(c) to the extent that the party
to whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice
would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such
notice.

                         SECTION 6: Other Provisions

     6.1  Attorneys' Fees.  If any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought
against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other
relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

                                      6.
<PAGE>

     6.2  Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or by facsimile) to the
address or facsimile telephone number set forth in Section 10.5 of the Merger
Agreement (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number as such party
shall have specified in a written notice given to the other parties hereto).

     6.3  Headings.  The underlined headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this

each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when taken
together, shall constitute one agreement.

     6.5  Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with,
and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of California
(without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

     6.6  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon each of
the parties hereto and each of their respective permitted successors and
assigns, if any. No Stockholder may assign such Stockholder's rights under this
Agreement without the express prior written consent of Parent, provided,
however, that (i) upon the death of a Stockholder, such Stockholder's rights
under this Agreement shall be transferred to the person(s) who receive such
Stockholder's Parent Common Stock under the laws of descent and distribution,
(ii) a Stockholder may assign such Stockholder's rights under this Agreement to
any organization qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
to which the Stockholder transfers Registerable Shares or in connection with an
estate planning transaction, and (iii) such Stockholder may transfer its rights
under this Agreement to any transferee of 50,000 or more of the Registerable
Shares (subject to appropriate adjustment based on stock dividends, stock splits
and other similar transactions after the date hereof) who agrees in writing to
be bound by the terms of this Agreement to the same extent as if such transferee
were a Stockholder hereunder and subject to such Stockholder's prior delivery to
Parent of an opinion of counsel in form reasonably satisfactory to the Parent to
the effect that the transfer of Registerable Shares was made in compliance with
all applicable federal and state securities laws. Nothing in this Agreement is
intended to confer, or shall be deemed to confer, any rights or remedies upon
any person or entity other than the parties hereto and their permitted
successors and assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of: the
Stockholders; Parent; and the respective successors and assigns, if any, of the
foregoing.

     6.7  Waiver.  No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.  No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising
out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and

                                      7.
<PAGE>

delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

     6.8  Amendments.  This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of all of the parties hereto.

     6.9  Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

     6.10  Parties in Interest.  Except for the provisions of Section 5.3, none
of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights or
remedies to any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, if any.

     6.11  Entire Agreement.  This Agreement and the other agreements referred
to herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.

for, among other things, all matters set forth in Section 9 of the Merger
Agreement.

                                   AGREEMENT

     The parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

     1.  Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Merger Agreement,
a copy of which is attached hereto.

     2.  Escrow and Indemnification.

         (a)  Shares and Stock Powers Placed in Escrow. At the Effective Time:
     (i) Parent shall issue a certificate for ______ [10% of shares to be
     received by Dean Kruse] shares of Parent Common Stock in the name of the
     Dean V. Kruse and a certificate for ______ [10% of shares to be received by
     Mitchell Kruse] shares of Parent Common Stock in the name of

                                       1.
<PAGE>

Mitchell Kruse (or any trust or foundation into which Mitchell Kruse transfers
such escrow shares), evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be held in
escrow in accordance with this Agreement and Section 1.3(ii) of the Merger
Agreement (the "10% Escrow"), (ii) Parent shall issue a certificate for ______
[2% of shares to be received by Dean Kruse] shares of Parent Common Stock in the
name of the Dean V. Kruse and a certificate for ______ [2% of shares to be
received by Mitchell Kruse] shares of Parent Common Stock in the name of
Mitchell Kruse (or any trust or foundation into which Mitchell Kruse transfers
such escrow shares), evidencing the shares of Parent Common Stock to be held in
escrow in accordance with this Agreement and Section 1.3(iii) of the Merger
Agreement (the "Form 8300 Escrow") and (iii) the applicable Stockholder (or in
the case of a transfer to a trust or foundation, such trust or foundation) shall
deliver to Parent five original "assignments separate from certificate" ("Stock
Powers") for each certificate described above, each such Stock Power endorsed by
the applicable stockholder in blank with his or its signature guaranteed by a
commercial bank or by a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange. The shares
of Parent Common Stock being held in escrow pursuant to this Agreement (the
"Escrow Shares") shall constitute an escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") with
respect to the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders under the Merger
Agreements. The Escrow Fund shall be held as a trust fund and shall not be
subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process
of any creditor of any Stockholder or of any party hereto. Parent agrees to act
as the escrow agent and agrees to accept delivery of the Escrow Fund and to hold
the Escrow Fund in an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.

          (b)  Voting of Escrow Shares. The record owner of the Escrow Shares
shall be entitled to exercise all voting rights with respect to such Escrow
Shares.

          (c)  Dividends, Etc. Parent and each Stockholder agree among
themselves, for the benefit of Parent as escrow agent, that any cash, securities
or other property distributable (whether by way of dividend, stock split or
otherwise) in respect of or in exchange for any Escrow Shares shall not be
distributed to the record owners of such Escrow Shares, but rather shall be
distributed to and held by Parent in the Escrow Account. Unless and until Parent
shall actually receive such cash, securities or other property, it may assume
without inquiry that the Escrow Shares currently being held by it in the Escrow
Account are all that Parent is required to hold. At the time any Escrow Shares
are required to be released from the applicable escrow to any Person pursuant to
this Escrow Agreement, any cash, securities or other property previously
received by Parent in respect of or in exchange for such Escrow Shares shall be
released from the applicable escrow to such Person.

          (d)  Transferability. The interests of the applicable Stockholder in
the applicable escrow and in the Escrow Shares shall not be assignable or
transferable, other than by operation of law and except for transfers to trusts
or foundations that agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement (including
the designation of the Stockholders' Agent as its agent for the purposes
described herein). No transfer of any of such interests, including by operation
of law, shall be recognized or given effect until Parent shall have received
written notice of such transfer.

          (e)  Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be retained in or released from the applicable escrow pursuant to this
Escrow Agreement. In connection with any release of Escrow Shares from either
escrow, Parent shall "round down" in

                                      2.
<PAGE>

order to avoid retaining any fractional share in the applicable escrow and in
order to avoid releasing any fractional share from the applicable escrow. When
shares are "rounded down", no cash-in-lieu payments need to be made.

     3.  Administration of Escrow Account.  Except as otherwise provided herein,
Parent shall administer the Escrow Account as follows:

         (a)  If any Indemnitee has or claims to have incurred or suffered
Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 9.2(a) of the Merger Agreement, such Indemnitee may,
on or prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the "10% Escrow
Termination Date"), deliver a claim notice (a "Claim Notice") to each of the
Stockholders and to Parent. Each Claim Notice shall state that such Indemnitee
believes that there is or has been a breach of a representation, warranty or
covenant contained in the Merger Agreement or that such Indemnitee is otherwise
entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under the Merger
Agreement and contain a brief description of the circumstances supporting such
Indemnitee's belief that there is or has been such a breach or that such
Indemnitee is so entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement and
shall, to the extent possible, contain a non-binding, preliminary estimate of
the amount of Damages such Indemnitee claims to have so incurred or suffered
(the "Claimed Amount").

         (b)  If any Indemnitee has or claims to have incurred or suffered
Damages for which it is or may be entitled to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Section 9.2(c) of the Merger Agreement, such Indemnitee may,
on or prior to the date that all claims under Section 9.2(c) of the Merger
Agreement relating to the alleged failure of the Companies to make required Form
8300 filings in the years 1990, 1991 and 1992 are fully and finally resolved
(the "Form 8300 Escrow Termination Date"), deliver a Claim Notice to each of the
Stockholders and to Parent. Each such Claim Notice shall state that such
Indemnitee believes that such Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement under Section 9.2(c) of the Merger Agreement and
contain a brief description of the circumstances supporting such Indemnitee's
belief that it is entitled to indemnification, compensation or reimbursement and
shall, to the extent possible, contain a non-binding, preliminary estimate of
the Claimed Amount.

         (c)  Indemnification claims based on Section 9.2(a) of the Merger
Agreement are limited to the 10% Escrow. Indemnification claims based on Section
9.2(c) of the Merger Agreement shall be satisfied first out of the Form 8300
Escrow but such claims shall not be limited to the Form 8300 Escrow.

         (d)  Within 20 business days after receipt by Parent of a Claim Notice,
the Stockholders' Agent may deliver to the Indemnitee who delivered the Claim
Notice and to Parent a written response (the "Response Notice") in which the
Stockholders' Agent: (i) agrees that a whole number of Escrow Shares having a
"Stipulated Value" (as defined below) equal to the full Claimed Amount may be
released from the applicable escrow to the Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that Escrow
Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to part, but not all, of the Claimed
Amount (the "Agreed Amount") may be released from the applicable escrow to the
Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount may be
released from the applicable escrow to the Indemnitee. Any part of the Claimed
Amount that is not to be released to the Indemnitee

                                      3.
<PAGE>

shall be the "Contested Amount." If a Response Notice is not received by Parent
within such 20 business-day period, then the Stockholders' Agent shall be deemed
to have agreed that Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to the full
Claimed Amount may be released to the Indemnitee from the applicable escrow.

          (e)  If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice agreeing
that Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to the full Claimed Amount
may be released from the applicable escrow to the Indemnitee, or if the
Stockholders' Agent does not deliver a Response Notice in accordance with
Section 3(d), Parent shall promptly following the receipt of the Response Notice
(or, if the Stockholders' Agent has not delivered a Response Notice, promptly
following the expiration of the 20 business-day period referred to in Section
3(d)), deliver to such Indemnitee such Escrow Shares.

          (f)  If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice agreeing
that Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount may be released from the applicable escrow to the Indemnitee,
Parent shall promptly following the receipt of the Response Notice deliver to
such Indemnitee Escrow Shares having a Stipulated Value equal to the Agreed
Amount.

          (g)  If the Stockholders' Agent delivers a Response Notice indicating
that there is a Contested Amount, the Stockholders' Agent and the Indemnitee
shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute related to the Contested
Amount. If the Indemnitee and the Stockholders' Agent shall resolve such
dispute, such resolution shall be binding on both Stockholders and a settlement
agreement shall be signed by the Indemnitee and the Stockholders' Agent and sent
to Parent, who shall, upon receipt thereof, release Escrow Shares from the
applicable escrow in accordance with such agreement.

          (h) If the Stockholders' Agent and the Indemnitee are unable to
resolve the dispute relating to any Contested Amount within 30 business days
after the delivery of the Claim Notice, then the claim described in the Claim
Notice shall be settled by binding arbitration in the County of Santa Clara in
the State of California in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules then
in effect of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA Rules"). Three
arbitrators will conduct the arbitration; one selected by Parent, one selected
by the Stockholders' Agent and the third selected by the first two arbitrators.
If the Stockholders' Agent fails to select an arbitrator prior to the expiration
of the 30-business day period referred to in the first sentence of this Section
3(h), then Parent shall be entitled to select the second arbitrator. The parties
agree to use all reasonable efforts to cause the arbitration hearing to be
conducted within 60 calendar days after the appointment of the last of the three
arbitrators and to use all reasonable efforts to cause the arbitrators' decision
to be furnished within 95 calendar days after the appointment of the last of the
three arbitrators. The parties further agree that discovery shall be completed
at least 20 business days prior to the date of the arbitration hearing. The
arbitrators' decision shall relate solely to whether the Indemnitee is entitled
to recover the Contested Amount (or a portion thereof), and the portion of such
Contested Amount the Indemnitee is entitled to recover. The final decision of
the arbitrators shall be furnished to the Stockholders' Agent, the Indemnitee
and Parent in writing and shall constitute a conclusive determination of the
issue in question, binding upon the Stockholders, the Indemnitee and Parent and
shall not be contested by any of them. The non-prevailing party in any
arbitration shall pay the reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees and
expenses) of the prevailing party and the fees and expenses associated with

                                      4.
<PAGE>

the arbitration (including the arbitrators' fees and expenses). For purposes of
this Section 3(h), the non-prevailing party shall be deemed to be the Indemnitee
if it is entitled to recover less than 50% of the Contested Amount; otherwise it
shall be the Stockholders.

          (i)  Parent shall release Escrow Shares from the applicable escrow in
connection with any Contested Amount within 5 business days after the delivery
to it of: (i) a copy of a settlement agreement executed by the Indemnitee and
the Stockholders' Agent setting forth instructions to Parent as to the number of
Escrow Shares, if any, to be released from the applicable escrow, with respect
to such Contested Amount; or (ii) a copy of the award of the arbitrators
referred to and as provided in Section 3(h) setting forth instructions to Parent
as to the number of Escrow Shares, if any, to be released from the applicable
escrow, with respect to such Contested Amount.

     4.  Release of Escrow Shares. Parent is not the stock transfer agent for
the Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, if a distribution of a number of shares of
Parent Common Stock less than all of the Escrow Shares in the applicable escrow
is to be made, Parent must requisition the appropriate number of shares from
such stock transfer agent, delivering to it the appropriate stock certificates
and related Stock Powers. For the purposes of this Agreement, Parent shall be
deemed to have delivered Parent Common Stock to the Person entitled to it when
Parent has delivered such certificates and Stock Powers to such stock transfer
agent with instructions to deliver it to the appropriate Person. Distributions
of Parent Common Stock shall be made to Parent or the Stockholders, as
appropriate, at the addresses described in Section 9(b). Whenever a distribution
is to be made to Stockholders, pro rata distributions shall be made to each
applicable Stockholder based on the number of Escrow Shares held in the
applicable escrow (either the 10% Escrow or the Form 8300 Escrow) with respect
to the applicable Stockholder. Within five business days after the termination
date of the applicable escrow (either the 10% Escrow Termination Date or the
Form 8033 Escrow Termination Date), Parent shall distribute or cause the stock
transfer agent for the Parent Common Stock to distribute to each applicable
Stockholder such Stockholder's pro-rata portion of the Escrow Shares in the
applicable escrow then held in escrow; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, prior to the applicable termination date, any Indemnitee has
given a Claim Notice containing a claim that has not been resolved prior to the
applicable termination date in accordance with Section 3, Parent shall retain in
the applicable escrow after the applicable termination date Escrow Shares having
a Stipulated Value equal to 100% of the Claimed Amount or Contested Amount, as
the case may be, with respect to all claims that have not then been resolved.

     5.  Valuation of Escrow Shares, Etc.

         (a)  Stipulated Value. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Stipulated
Value" of each Escrow Share shall be deemed to be equal to $______ [the
Calculated Stock Price (the average closing price of Parent common stock for the
twenty trading days immediately preceding the Closing Date)].

         (b)  Stock Splits. All numbers contained in, and all calculations
required to be made pursuant to, this Agreement shall be adjusted as appropriate
to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or similar
transaction effected by Parent after the date hereof; provided, however, that
Parent shall have received the appropriate number of additional shares of Parent
Common Stock or other property pursuant to Section 2(c) hereof.

                                      5.
<PAGE>

     6.  Exclusive Remedy. Subject to Section 9.3 of the Merger Agreement, and
Section 3(c) of this Agreement, from and after the Closing, the Escrow Shares
(adjusted as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend or similar transaction effected by Parent after the date hereof) shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and the other Indemnitees for
monetary damages for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement.

     7.  Limitation of Parent's Liability as Escrow Agent. Parent shall incur no
liability as escrow agent with respect to any action taken by it or for any
inaction on its part in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction,
consent, statement or other document believed by it to be genuine and duly
authorized, nor for any other action or inaction as escrow agent except for its
own willful misconduct or negligence. Parent, as escrow agent, may rely on and
use the Stock Powers and shall not be liable in connection therewith.

     8.  Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the later to occur of
(i) the 10% Escrow Termination Date and (ii) the Form 8300 Escrow Termination
Date or, if earlier, upon the release by Parent of the entire Escrow Fund in
accordance with this Agreement; provided, however, that if Parent has received
from any Indemnitee a Claim Notice setting forth a claim that has not been
resolved by the later termination date in connection with a claim under that
escrow, then this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the
claim has been resolved and the Escrow Shares released in accordance with this
Agreement.

     9.  Miscellaneous.

         (a)  Attorneys' Fees. If any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought
against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other
relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

         (b)  Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted
to be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed properly delivered, given and received when delivered (by hand, by
registered mail, by courier or express delivery service or by facsimile) to the
address or facsimile telephone number set forth in Section 10.5 of the Merger
Agreement (or to such other address or facsimile telephone number as such party
shall have specified in a written notice given to the other parties hereto).

         (c)  Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, shall not be deemed to be a part of this
Agreement and shall not be referred to in connection with the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement.

         (d)  Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which, when
taken together, shall constitute one agreement.

         (e)  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with, and governed in all respects by, the internal laws of the State of
California (without giving effect to principles of conflicts of laws).

                                      6.
<PAGE>

         (f)  Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon each
of the parties hereto and each of their respective permitted successors and
assigns, if any. No Stockholder may assign such Stockholder's rights under this
Agreement without the express prior written consent of Parent, provided,
however, that (i) upon the death of a Stockholder, such Stockholder's rights
under this Agreement shall be transferred to the person(s) who receive such
Stockholder's Parent Common Stock under the laws of descent and distribution,
and (ii) a Stockholder may assign such Stockholder's rights under this Agreement
to any organization qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue
Code to which the Stockholder transfers Escrow Shares or in connection with an
estate planning transaction. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer, or
shall be deemed to confer, any rights or remedies upon any person or entity
other than the parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of: the Stockholders; Parent and the
respective successors and assigns, if any, of the foregoing.

         (g)  Waiver. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part
of any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy;
and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy
shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power,
right, privilege or remedy. No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim
arising out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under
this Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or
remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

        (h)  Amendments. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of each of the parties hereto; provided, however, that any
amendment duly executed and delivered by the Stockholders' Agent shall be deemed
to have been duly executed and delivered by each of the Stockholders.

        (i)  Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

        (j)  Parties in Interest. None of the provisions of this Agreement is
intended to provide any rights or remedies to any Person other than the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns, if any.

        (k)  Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other agreements referred
to herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof.

                                      7.

        (l)  Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives any and all right to trial by jury in any Legal Proceeding arising out of
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

        (m)  Tax Reporting Information and Certification of Tax Identification
Numbers.

             (i)   The parties hereto agree that, for tax reporting purposes,
all on or other income, if any, attributable to the Escrow Shares or any other
amount held in escrow by Parent pursuant to this Agreement shall be allocable in
equal shares to the Stockholders.

             (ii)  Each of the Stockholders agree to provide Parent with
certified tax identification numbers for each of them by furnishing appropriate
forms W-9 (or Forms W-8, in the case of non-U.S. persons) and other forms and
documents that Parent may reasonably request (collectively, "Tax Reporting
Documentation") to Parent within 30 days after the date hereof. The parties
hereto understand that, if such Tax Reporting Documentation is not so certified
to Parent, Parent may be required by the Internal Revenue Code, as it may be
amended from time to time, to withhold a portion of any interest or other income
earned on the investment of monies or other property held by Parent pursuant to
this Escrow Agreement.

             (iii) Parent need not make any distribution of Escrow Shares to any
Person until such Person has furnished to Parent such Tax Reporting
Documentation as Parent may reasonably require.

        (n)  Construction.

the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall

                         FORM OF STUART KRUSE RELEASE



                               ___________, 1999


eBay Inc. ("Parent")
2005 Hamilton Avenue, Suite 350
San Jose, CA  95125

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     Reference is made to that certain Stock Sale Agreement, dated December 29,
1997 (the "Sale Agreement"), by and among Kruse, Inc., Auburn Cordage, Inc.,
Dean V. Kruse, Mitchell Kruse, and Stuart Kruse wherein (y) Dean V. Kruse and
Mitchell Kruse (the "Purchasers") agreed to pay $200,000 to Stuart Kruse for all
of his stock in Kruse Inc. and in Auburn Cordage, Inc. (the "Shares"), and (z)
Kruse Inc. and Auburn Cordage, Inc. agreed to pay $240,142.13 to Stuart Kruse in
connection with a noncompetition provision in the Sale Agreement.  Kruse Inc.
and Auburn Cordage, Inc., together with ACD Auto Sales, Inc., Reppert School of
Auctioneering, Inc., Classic Advertising & Promotions, Inc., collectively, are
referred to as the "Companies".

     I acknowledge the concurrent payment to me of $200,000, plus interest, on
the date hereof from the Purchasers in regard to their purchase of my Shares on
December 29, 1997 pursuant to the Sale Agreement. I also acknowledge the prior
payment to me by Kruse, Inc. and Auburn Cordage, Inc. of $100,000 (including
interest of $15,211.19), and the concurrent payment to me of $155,353.32, plus
interest, in connection with the noncompetition provision in the Sale Agreement.
As a result of such payments, I acknowledge that I have no lien on any shares of
capital stock of Kruse, Inc. nor Auburn Cordage, Inc. nor any of the other
Companies.

     In order to induce Parent to take measures to accelerate payment of the
moneys owing to me under the noncompetition provision, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned, intending to be legally bound, hereby covenants
and agrees as follows:

     1.  Release. The undersigned (on behalf of himself and each person or
entity that the undersigned has the power to bind) hereby irrevocably,
unconditionally and completely releases, acquits and forever discharges each of
the Releasees (as defined below) from any Claim (as defined below), and hereby
irrevocably, unconditionally and completely waives and relinquishes each and
every Claim that the undersigned may have had in the past, may now have or may
have in the future against any of the Releasees, relating to any written or oral
agreements or arrangements entered into, and any events, matters, causes,
things, acts, omissions or conduct, occurring or existing, at any time up to and
including the date of this letter, including, without limitation, any Claim (a)
to the effect that the undersigned is or may be entitled to any compensation,
benefits, commissions or perquisites from any of the Companies or any of its
<PAGE>

direct or indirect subsidiaries, or (b) otherwise arising (directly or
indirectly) out of or in any way connected with the undersigned's stockholdings,
employment or other relationship with any of the Companies or any of its
stockholders; provided, however, that the undersigned is not releasing the
undersigned's rights, if any:

               (i) under the  indemnification provisions contained in the
     Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of any of the Companies; or
