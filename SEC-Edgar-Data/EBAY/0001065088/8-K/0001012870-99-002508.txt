Item 2:  Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

The undersigned registrant hereby amends the following items, financial
statements, exhibits or other portions of the following Current Reports on Form
8-K, as set forth below and in the pages attached hereto:

 .  Form 8-K filed on May 28, 1999, related to the Registrant's acquisition of
   Kruse, Inc. (d.b.a. Kruse International), Auburn Cordage, Inc., ACD Auto
   Sales, Inc., Reppert School of Auctioneering, Inc. and Classic Advertising &
   Promotions, Inc., (collectively, "Kruse" or the "Kruse International Group of
   Companies") on May 18, 1999, by means of a merger among eBay Inc. ("eBay"),
   each of the Kruse companies, five merger subsidiaries wholly-owned by eBay,
   Dean V. Kruse and Mitchell Kruse.

 .  Form 8-K filed on June 7, 1999, related to the Registrant's acquisition of
   Billpoint, Inc. ("Billpoint") on May 25, 1999, by means of a merger among
   eBay, Billpoint and Brazil Acquisition Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of
   eBay.

 .  Form 8-K filed on June 7, 1999, related to the Registrant's acquisition of
   Butterfield & Butterfield Auctioneers on May 28, 1999 by means of a merger
   among eBay, Butterfield & Butterfield Auctioneers, a merger subsidiary
   wholly-owned by eBay, the stockholders of Butterfield & Butterfield
   Auctioneers, 111 Potrero Partners, LLC, HBJ Partners, LLC and the members of
   the 111 Potrero Partners, LLC and HBJ Partners, LLC (collectively, "B&B" or
   the "Butterfield & Butterfield Group of Companies").

Item 5:  Other Events.

Risk Factors that may Affect Results of Operations and Financial Condition of
the Acquired Companies.

The acquisition itself may adversely affect the Acquired Companies.

The process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen operating
difficulties and expenditures and is itself risky.  The areas where we may face
difficulties include:

 .  diversion of management time (both ours and at the acquired companies) during
   the period of negotiation through closing and further diversion of such time
   after closing from focus on operating the businesses to issues of integration
   and future products;
 .  decline in employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in
   compensation, reporting relationships, future prospects, or the direction of
   the business;
 .  the need to integrate each company's accounting, management information,
   human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective
   management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not
   implemented;
 .  the need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a
   larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had been
   smaller, private companies; and
 .  we have almost no experience in managing this integration process.

Our new land-based auction businesses need to continue to acquire properties.

The businesses of B&B and Kruse are both dependent on the continued acquisition
of high quality auction properties from sellers.  Their future success will
depend in part on their ability to maintain an adequate supply of high
quality auction property, particularly fine and decorative arts and collectibles
and collectible automobiles, respectively.  There is intense competition for
these pieces with other auction companies and dealers. In addition, a small
number of key senior management and specialists maintain the relationships with
the primary sources of auction property and the loss of any of these individuals
could adversely affect the business of B&B and Kruse.  See "The acquired
businesses are dependent on a small number of key employees."

Our new land-based auction businesses could suffer losses from price guarantees,
advances or rescissions of sales.

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

In order to secure high quality auction properties from sellers, B&B and Kruse
may give a guaranteed minimum price or a cash advance to a seller, based on the
estimated value of the property.  If the auction proceeds are less than the
amount guaranteed, or less than the amount advanced and the seller does not
repay the difference, the company involved will suffer a loss. In addition,
under certain circumstances a buyer who believes that an item purchased at
auction does not have good title, provenance or authenticity may rescind the
purchase.  Under such circumstances, the company involved will lose its
commissions and fees on the sale even if the seller, in accordance with the
terms and conditions of sale, in turn accepts back the item and returns the
funds he or she received from the sale.

Our new land-based auction businesses are dependent on discretionary consumer
spending.

A decline in consumer spending would harm our new land-based auction businesses.
Sales of fine and decorative art, collectable cars and other collectibles would
be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending,
especially for luxury items.  Changes in buyer's tastes, economic conditions or
consumer trends could cause declines in the number or dollar volume of items
auctioned and thereby harm the business of these companies.

Our new businesses are dependent on a small number of key employees.

Our new businesses are all dependent on attracting and retaining key employees.
The land-based auction businesses are particularly dependent on specialists and
senior management because of the relationships these individuals have
established with sellers who consign property for sale at auction.  Dean Kruse
is particularly important to Kruse. The loss of any of these individuals could
result in the loss of significant future business and would harm us.  Such
personnel are in great demand by other auction companies. In addition, employee
turnover frequently increases during the period following an acquisition as
employees evaluate possible changes in compensation, culture, reporting
relationships, and the direction of the business. Such increased turnover could
increase our costs and reduce our future revenues.

Our new land-based businesses are subject to regulation.

Both B&B and Kruse are subject to regulation in some jurisdictions governing the
manner in which auctions are conducted.  Both are required to obtain licensure
in certain jurisdictions with respect to their business or to permit the sale of
certain properties (e.g. wine, automobiles, real estate).  Such licenses must
generally be regularly renewed and are subject to revocation for violation of
law, violation of the regulations governing auctions in general or the sale of
the particular item and other events.  If either company was unable to renew a
license or had a license revoked it would be harmed.  In addition, changes to
the regulations or the licensure requirements could increase the complexity and
the cost of doing auctions, thereby harming us.

Our new payments business may be subject to regulation.

Businesses that handle consumers' funds are potentially subject to numerous
regulations, including those related to banking, credit cards, escrow, fair
credit reporting and others.  Billpoint is a new business with a relatively
novel approach to facilitating payments.  It is not yet known how regulatory
agencies will treat Billpoint. The cost and complexity of Billpoint's business
may increase if certain regulations are deemed to apply to its business.

We acquired real property with some of our new businesses.

In connection with the acquisition of Kruse and B&B we acquired real property
including land, buildings and interests in partnerships holding land and
buildings.  We have no experience in managing real property.  Ownership of this
property subjects us to new risks, including:

 .  the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated
   with fixing any environmental problems;
 .  the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with
   zoning, seismic, disability act or other requirements;
 .  possible disputes with tenants, partners or others.

Our new land-based auction businesses are seasonal and are subject to
significant quarterly fluctuations.

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

Both B&B and Kruse have significant quarter to quarter variations in their
results depending on the timing of auctions and the availability of high quality
items from large collections and estates. B&B typically has its best operating
results in the traditional fall and spring auction seasons and has historically
incurred operating losses in the first and third quarters. This seasonal effect
may be partially offset by Kruse, which typically sees a seasonal peak in
operations with its Auburn, Indiana auction around Labor Day.

Our new businesses could be harmed by Year 2000 compliance problems.

Our new businesses are heavily dependent upon the functioning of their computer
systems.  Any failure or malfunction of their information, business, finance,
accounting, or other systems could harm these businesses in a manner that is
impossible to currently quantify or anticipate. We are currently reviewing the
Y2K status of these businesses.  If necessary upgrades or changes are not
properly identified, or if they cannot be successfully and timely implemented
even if properly identified, these businesses could be harmed.

Our new businesses are subject to intense competition.

The land-based auction business is intensely competitive. B&B competes with two
larger and better known auction companies, Sotheby's Holdings, Inc. and
Christie's International plc, as well as numerous regional auction companies. To
the extent that these companies increase their focus on the middle market
properties that form the core of B&B's business, its business may suffer. Kruse
is subject to competition from numerous regional competitors. In addition,
competition with Internet based auctions may harm the land-based auction
business. Although Billpoint's business is new, several companies are beginning
to enter this market and large competitors, including banks and credit card
companies, may become competitors.


Item 7:  Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits.

(a)  Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired

     See Exhibit 99.1 for the audited combined financial statements of the Kruse
Group of Companies, Exhibit 99.2 for the audited financial statements of
Billpoint and Exhibit 99.3 for the audited combined financial statements of the
Butterfield & Butterfield Group of Companies.

(b)  Pro Forma Financial Information

     Pro Forma Condensed Financial Information (Unaudited)

     The following unaudited pro forma combined financial statements give effect
to the mergers of eBay with Kruse, Billpoint and B&B (the "Acquired Entities"),
which were accounted for as poolings of interests. The unaudited pro forma
condensed balance sheet presents the combined financial position of eBay and the
Acquired Entities as of March 31, 1999, assuming that each of the mergers had
occurred as of March 31, 1999. Such pro forma information is based upon the
historical balance sheet data of eBay and the Acquired Entities as of that date.
The unaudited pro forma condensed statement of income gives effect to the
mergers of eBay and the Acquired Entities by combining the results of operations
of eBay and the Acquired Entities for the three years ended December 31, 1998
and the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999, on a pooling of interests
basis, with the exception of Billpoint, which is included from its date of
inception of September 1, 1998. These unaudited pro forma financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes
thereto of eBay included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1998 and the historical financial statements and notes thereto of
the Acquired Entities included as exhibits herein.

     The unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes
only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results or financial
position that would have occurred if the mergers had been consummated at the
beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of future
operating results or financial position.  In addition, the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements do not incorporate increases in property
taxes that the combined company will be subject to as a result of increases in
the tax basis of certain real estate holdings of B&B

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

which, because the acquisitions have been accounted for as poolings of
interests, remain at historical cost for book purposes.

     eBay and the Acquired Entities incurred direct transaction costs of
approximately $4.3 million associated with the mergers which were charged to
operations during the three months ended June 30, 1999.  There can be no
assurance that eBay will not incur additional charges in subsequent periods to
reflect costs associated with the mergers or that management will be successful
in its efforts to integrate the operations of the companies. This charge is
reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet, but is
not reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of
operations.  This charge is based upon an estimate and is subject to change.

1. Basis of Presentation

  Pro Forma Basis of Presentation

  The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of eBay,
  Kruse, Billpoint and B&B give retroactive effect to the mergers, which are
  being accounted for as poolings of interests and, as a result, the unaudited
  pro forma condensed combined balance sheets and statements of operations are
  presented as if eBay and the Acquired Entities had been combined for all
  periods presented.

  The pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect the issuance of
  a total of approximately 2,638,800 shares of eBay common stock for all of the
  outstanding shares of Kruse, Billpoint and B&B outstanding as of the dates of
  the respective mergers. This total consists of approximately 787,300 shares of
  eBay common stock issued for all of the outstanding shares of Kruse, 524,100
  shares of eBay common stock issued for all of the outstanding shares of
  Billpoint, and 1,327,400 shares of eBay common stock issued for all of the
  outstanding shares of B&B in connection with the mergers, which resulted in
  exchange ratios of approximately 339.35862, 0.05912 and 0.27931 shares of eBay
  common stock for each share of Kruse, Billpoint and B&B, respectively. In
  addition, options and warrants representing 2,233,181 shares of Billpoint
  common stock were assumed by eBay and converted into options and warrants
  representing approximately 132,000 shares of eBay common stock.

  Acquired Entities

  The components of pro forma net revenues, operating expenses and net income
  (loss) during the three months ended March 31, 1999 and 1998 and the years
  ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 are as follows:

2. Merger Transaction Costs

   eBay and the Acquired Entities incurred direct transaction costs of
   approximately $4.3 million associated with the mergers, including $1.5
   million for legal and other professional consulting fees and $2.8 million for
   various fees including those associated with the termination of B&B's initial
   public offering, which will be charged to operations during the quarter ended
   June 30, 1999, the period in which the transactions were consummated. There
   can be no assurance that eBay will not incur additional charges in subsequent
   quarters to reflect costs associated with the mergers or that management will
   be successful in their efforts to integrate the operations of the respective
   companies. This charge is an estimate and is subject to change.

3. Income Taxes

   The provision for income taxes does not reflect the benefit of Billpoint's
   net operating losses due to certain limitations and uncertainty surrounding
   the realization of the tax benefits associated with such losses. Because the
   acquisition of the B&B entities has been accounted for as a pooling of
   interests, there has been no adjustment to the historical carrying values of
   real estate holdings. However, these properties are subject to increases in
   tax basis, which will result in a higher depreciable basis for income and
   property tax purposes.

   In connection with the acquisition of B&B by eBay, B&B's status as an S
   Corporation was terminated, and B&B became subject to federal and state
   income taxes. The supplemental pro forma information includes an increase to
   the provisions for income taxes based upon a combined federal and state tax
   rate of 42%, which approximates the statutory tax rates that would have
   applied if B&B had been taxed as a C corporation during the periods prior to
   its acquisition by eBay.

4. Pro Forma Adjustments

   The following pro forma adjustments have been made to the historical
   financial statements of eBay and the Acquired Entities based upon preliminary
   estimates and assumptions made by management for the purpose of preparing the
   unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements. There have been
   no significant intercompany transactions.

   (A)  To record the accrual of estimated costs resulting from the mergers. See
        Note 2 above.

   (B)  A portion of the B&B acquisition was a taxable transaction, accordingly,
        a deferred tax asset and a corresponding increase in stockholders equity
        of approximately $8,753,000 was recorded for the difference between the
        financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of the related net
        assets upon the closing of the transaction.

   (C)  To record the deferred tax asset relating to temporary differences
        within the B&B Group Companies upon the change in status from an
        S Corporation to a C Corporation for federal income tax purposes.

5. Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Per Share

   The pro forma combined basic and diluted net income (loss) per share is based
   on the combined weighted average number of common shares of eBay Common Stock
   and the Acquired Entities' Common Stock outstanding for each period using the
   relevant exchange ratios based on the issuance of approximately 2,638,800
   shares of eBay Common Stock for all of the outstanding shares of the Acquired
   Entities as of their respective acquisition dates. All convertible preferred
   stock, warrants and employee stock options have been included in the
   computation of pro forma combined diluted net income per share using the
   treasury stock method to the extent such instruments are dilutive for the
   periods presented.

                      Report of Independent Accountants


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of the Kruse International Group of Companies


In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related combined
statements of operations and shareholder's equity and of cash flows present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the Kruse
International Group of Companies at December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the combined
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Group's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                             KRUSE INTERNATIONAL
                              GROUP OF COMPANIES
                   NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     (in thousands, except share amounts)

1. The Group Companies and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   The Group Companies and Basis of Presentation

   The accompanying combined financial statements include the accounts of Kruse
   International, Auburn Cordage Inc., ACD Auto Sales Inc., Classic Advertising
   & Promotion Inc. and Reppert Auction School Inc. (collectively the "Group" or
   "Group Companies"). The financial statements for the aforementioned companies
   have been prepared on a combined basis for all periods presented as the
   companies were subject to common control. All intercompany accounts and
   transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of these combined
   financial statements.

   Kruse International - was founded in 1971 and operated as a sole
   proprietorship until it was incorporated in the state of Indiana in August
   1986. Kruse International conducts auctions and performs appraisal
   services for classic car auctions in various locations in the United
   States, England, Germany and the Netherlands.

   Auburn Cordage Inc. - was incorporated in September 1962 and operates as a
   real estate holding company for properties leased by Kruse International
   conducting its classic car auctions.

   ACD Auto Sales Inc. - was incorporated in March 1992 and operates as a
   special purpose entity for the ownership of auto dealer licenses on behalf of
   Kruse International.

   Classic Advertising & Promotion Inc. - was incorporated in Indiana and
   operates as a special purpose entity and provides advertising services on
   behalf of Kruse International.

   Reppert Auction School Inc. - was incorporated in June 1997 and operates a
   training center for auctioneers including those employed by Kruse
   International.

   Use of estimates
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
   accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
   that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
   contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
   reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
   Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   Revenue recognition
   Revenues are derived primarily from entry fees on auction items, bidder
   registration fees and commission fees calculated as a percentage of the final
   auction sales transaction value. Revenues related to these fees are
   recognized upon the completion of an auction. Revenues are also derived from
   sponsorship fees paid by various corporations. Sponsor fee revenues are
   recognized over the term of the sponsorship agreement. Advertising revenues
   and auctioneer tuition fees do not represent a significant source of revenues
   and are recognized as advertising and auctioneer training services are
   provided.

   Cash equivalents
   The Group Companies consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an
   original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash
   equivalents consist principally of deposit and money market accounts that are
   stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The Group Companies deposit
   cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions which management
   believes are of high credit quality.
<PAGE>

   Concentration of credit risk
   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group Companies to a
   concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and accounts
   receivable.  The Group Companies' accounts receivable are derived from
   revenues earned from customers located in the United States, England,
   Germany, The Netherlands and Japan and are denominated in U.S. dollars.
   Accounts receivable balances are typically settled upon completion of an
   auction and as a result, the Companies have minimal outstanding accounts
   receivable. During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 and the
   three month periods ended March 31, 1998 and 1999 (unaudited) no customers
   accounted for more than 10% of net revenues.

   Property and equipment
   Property and equipment are stated at historical cost.  Depreciation is
   computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
   the assets which range from five years for office equipment and vehicles to
   31.5 years for buildings and building improvements.

   Other assets
   Other assets consist primarily of a non-compete agreement with a former
   shareholder, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the 60
   month term of the agreement.

   Long-lived assets
   The Companies evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets in
   accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121,
   "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived
   Assets to be Disposed of" ("SFAS 121"). SFAS 121 requires recognition of
   impairment of long-lived assets in the event the net book value of such
   assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such
   assets.

   Fair value of financial instruments
   The Companies' financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents,
   accounts receivable and accounts payable are carried at cost, which
   approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
   instruments.

   Advertising expenses
   Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $1,691, $1,413,
   $1,787, $358 (unaudited) and $788 (unaudited) during the years ended December
   31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 and the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999
   respectively.

   Income taxes
   Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach, which
   requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year
   and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of
   events that have been recognized in the Companies' financial statements or
   tax returns.  The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and
   assets are based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future
   changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.  The measurement of
   deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax
   benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

   Comprehensive income
   Effective January 1, 1998, the Companies adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
   130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes standards for
   reporting comprehensive income and its components in financial statements.
   Comprehensive income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets)
   during a period from non-owner sources. To date, the Group Companies have not
   had any transactions that are required to be reported in comprehensive
   income.

   Segment information
   Effective January 1, 1998, the Group Companies adopted the provisions of SFAS
   No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
   Information." The Companies' management identify their operating segments
   based on business activities, management responsibility and geographic
   location. During all periods presented, the Group operated in a single
   business segment providing classic car auction services, primarily in the
   United States. Through March 31, 1999, foreign operations have not been
   significant.

   Foreign currency translation
   The Group Companies use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
   Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect
   during each period, and balance sheet amounts are translated at historical
   exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are
   included in the determination of net income or loss.

   Recent accounting pronouncements
   In April 1998, the AICPA issued Statement of Position ("SOP") 98-5 "Reporting
   on the Costs of Start-Up Activities." Start-up activities are defined broadly
   as those one-time activities related to opening a new facility, introducing a
   new product or service, commencing some new operation or organizing a new
   entity. Under SOP 98-5, the cost of start-up activities should be expensed as
   incurred. SOP 98-5 is effective January 1, 1999 and the Group Companies do
   not expect its adoption to have a material effect on their results of
   operations, financial position or cash flows.

   In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
   133, "Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities". SFAS 133 is
   effective for all fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter ending June 30,
   2000. SFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards of derivative
   instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
   contracts, and for hedging activities. The Group Companies will adopt SFAS
   No. 133 in the quarter ending June 30, 2000 and do not expect such adoption
   to have an impact on their results of operations, financial position or cash
   flows.

   Unaudited interim financial information
   The accompanying interim financial statements as of March 31, 1999 and for
   the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999, are unaudited. The unaudited
   interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the
   annual financial statements, and in the opinion of management, reflect all
   adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to
   present fairly the Company's financial position at March 31, 1999 and their
   results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31,
   1998 and 1999. The financial data and other information disclosed in these
   notes to the financial statements related to these periods are unaudited. The
   results for the three months ended March 31, 1999 are not necessarily
   indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31,
   1999.

5. Commitments and Contingencies

   Leases
   The Group Companies lease office space and equipment under noncancelable
   operating leases with various expiration dates through June 2001. Rent
   expense for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 and for the
   three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999 was $0, $57, $73, $4 (unaudited)
   and $11 (unaudited), respectively. The terms of the facility lease provide
   for rental payments on a graduated scale. The Group Companies recognize
   rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and have
   accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid.

   Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases at
   December 31, 1998 are as follows:

   Contingencies
   On July 1, 1992, the Group Companies were notified by the Internal Revenue
   Service that they had failed to make certain required filings of Form 5300,
   Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business, for the
   years 1990, 1991 and 1992. In December 1996, civil penalties were assessed
   against the Companies relating to this claim. These allegations are being
   vigorously defended by the Group Companies' management. The outcome of these
   allegations is unknown, however, management does not expect that resolution
   of this matter will have a material adverse impact on the Group Companies'
   financial position or results of operations.

   From time to time, the Group Companies are involved in other various disputes
   which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Management believes
   that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material
   adverse impact on the Companies' financial position or results of operations.


6. Employee Benefit Plans

   The Group Companies sponsor a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all
   employees. Contributions made by the Group Companies are determined annually
   by the Boards of Directors. Employer contributions under this plan totaled
   $0, $15, $0, $0 (unaudited) and $1 (unaudited) for the years ended December
   31, 1996, 1997, 1998 and the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999,
   respectively.

                       Report of Independent Accountants


To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Billpoint, Inc.


In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related statements of
operations, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Billpoint, Inc. (a company in the
development stage) at December 31, 1998 and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the period from September 1, 1998 (date of inception) through
December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit. We conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements,
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed
above.

                                BILLPOINT, INC.
                        (A Development Stage Company)
                        NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     (in thousands, except share amounts)

1. The Company and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

   The Company
   Billpoint, Inc. (the "Company"), began operations on September 1, 1998, and
   was incorporated in California on September 24, 1998.  The Company has
   developed a centralized, turnkey authorization, billing and payment
   fulfillment solution that permits individuals and small merchants to accept
   credit cards as payment for Internet-based sales transactions.  The Company's
   service, which was launched in December 1998, is expected to derive revenues
   based upon a variety of fee arrangements, including percentage-of-
   transaction, fixed-fee per transaction and flat monthly rates.

   Since its inception, the Company has been in the development stage, engaged
   primarily in research and development, recruiting personnel and raising
   capital.  To date, no revenues have been generated from its planned
   operations.  Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements are not
   indicative of a normal operating period.

   The Company has incurred losses during all periods since inception and
   expects to incur further losses related to the development of its product
   and service offerings; however, management believes that existing capital
   resources, including the equity financing secured subsequent to December
   31, 1998, will be sufficient to fund the Company's cash requirements
   through at least December 31, 1999.

   Use of estimates
   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
   accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
   that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
   contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
   reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
   Actual results could differ from those estimates.

   Cash equivalents
   The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an
   original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  At
   December 31, 1998 and March 31, 1999, $50 and $3,134 (unaudited),
   respectively, of money market funds, the fair value of which approximates
   cost, are included in cash and cash equivalents.

   Concentration of credit risk
   Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration
   of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company deposits
   cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions that management
   believes are of high credit quality.

   Software development costs
   Software development costs are included in research and development and are
   expensed as incurred.  After technological feasibility is established using
   the working model approach, material software development costs are
   capitalized.  The capitalized cost is then amortized on a straight-line basis
   over the estimated product life, or on the ratio of current revenues to total
   projected product revenues, whichever is greater.  To date, the period
   between achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of
   such software has been short and software development costs qualifying for
   capitalization have been insignificant.  Accordingly, the Company has not
   capitalized any software development costs.
<PAGE>

   Property and equipment
   Property and equipment are stated at cost.  Depreciation is computed using
   the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
   generally one to three years, or the lease term of the respective assets if
   shorter.

   Long-lived assets
   The Company evaluates the recoverability of its long-lived assets in
   accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 121,
   "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets
   to be Disposed of."  SFAS No. 121 requires recognition of impairment of long-
   lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the
   future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets.

   Income taxes
   Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach, which
   requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year
   and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of
   events that have been recognized in the Companies' financial statements or
   tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and
   assets are based on provisions of the enacted tax law; the effects of future
   changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated. The measurement of deferred
   tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that,
   based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.

   Research and development
   Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred.

   Stock compensation
   The Company accounts for stock-based employee compensation arrangements in
   accordance with the provisions of Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion
   No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and complies with the
   disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
   Compensation."  Under APB Opinion No. 25, unearned compensation is based on
   the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of
   the Company's Common Stock and the exercise price of the option.  The Company
   accounts for stock issued to non-employees in accordance with the provisions
   of SFAS No. 123 and EITF 96-18.

   Comprehensive income
   There were no items required to be reported in comprehensive loss for the
   periods presented.

   Recent accounting pronouncements
   In March 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
   ("AICPA") issued Statement of Position ("SOP") No. 98-1, "Accounting for the
   Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use."  SOP No.
   98-1 requires that entities capitalize certain costs related to internal-use
   software once certain criteria have been met.  The Company does not expect
   the adoption of SOP No. 98-1 to have a material impact on its financial
   position, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company will be required
   to implement SOP No. 98-1 for the year ending December 31, 1999.

   In April 1998, the AICPA issued SOP No. 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs of
   Start-Up Activities." SOP No. 98-5 requires that all start-up costs related
   to new operations be expensed as incurred. In addition, all start-up costs
   that were capitalized in the past must be written off when SOP No. 98-5 is
   adopted. The Company does not expect the adoption of SOP No. 98-5 to have a
   material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash
   flows. The Company will be required to implement SOP No. 98-5 for the year
   ending December 31, 1999.
<PAGE>

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
   "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," which
   establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial
   instruments and hedging activities.  Because the Company currently holds no
   derivative instruments and does not engage in hedging activities, the Company
   does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 133 to have a material impact on its
   financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  The Company will be
   required to implement SFAS No. 133 for the year ending December 31, 2000.

   Unaudited interim financial information
   The accompanying interim financial statements as of March 31, 1999 and for
   the three months then ended are unaudited.  The unaudited interim financial
   statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial
   statements, and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which
   include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the
   Company's financial position at March 31, 1999 and its results of operations
   and cash flows for the three months then ended.  The financial data and other
   information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to
   this period is unaudited. The results for the three months ended March 31,
   1999 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
   year ending December 31, 1999.

3. Income Taxes

   No provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded as the
   Company has incurred net operating losses from inception (September 1, 1998)
   to December 31, 1998. As of December 31, 1998, the Company had net operating
   loss carryforwards of approximately $50 for federal income tax purposes which
   can be used to reduce future taxable income. These net operating loss
   carryforwards begin to expire in 2014.

   Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the amounts of and benefits from net
   operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain
   circumstances.  Events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating
   losses that the Company may utilize in any one year include, but are not
   limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than 50%, as defined, over
   a three year period.  As a result of this limitation, the net operating loss
   carryforwards may expire prior to their utilization.
<PAGE>

4. Commitments

   Leases
   The Company leases office space and equipment under noncancelable operating
   leases with various expiration dates through February 2003.  Rent expense for
   the year ended December 31, 1998 and the period ended March 31, 1999 totaled
   $2,000 and $10,000 (unaudited), respectively.  The terms of the facility
   lease provide for rental payments on a graduated scale.  The Company
   recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease period, and
   has accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid.

   Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, including
   lease commitments entered into subsequent to December 31, 1998, are as
   follows:

5. Shareholders' Equity

   Convertible Preferred Stock
   The Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the issuance
   of 3,723,793 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, of which 320,000 shares,
   2,853,793 shares, and 550,000 shares are designated as Series A, Series B and
   Series C, respectively.  The holders of Convertible Preferred Stock have
   various rights and preferences as follows:

   Voting
   Each share of Series A and B Convertible Preferred Stock has voting rights
   equal to an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock into which it is
   convertible and votes together as one class with the Common Stock.

   As long as at least fifty percent of the Convertible Preferred Stock remain
   outstanding, the Company must obtain approval from a majority of the holders
   of Convertible Preferred Stock in order to amend the Articles of
   Incorporation as related to Convertible Preferred Stock, change the
   authorized number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, repurchase any
   shares of Common Stock other than shares subject to the right of repurchase
   by the Company, change the authorized number of Directors, authorize a
   dividend for any class or series other than Convertible Preferred Stock,
   create a new class of stock or effect a merger, consolidation or sale of
   assets where the existing shareholders retain less than 50% of the voting
   stock of the surviving entity.
<PAGE>

   Dividends
   Holders of Series A and B Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive
   noncumulative dividends at the per annum rate of $0.04 and $0.10 per share,
   respectively, when and if declared by the Board of Directors.  The holders of
   Series A and B Convertible Preferred Stock will also be entitled to
   participate in dividends on Common Stock, when and if declared by the Board
   of Directors, based on the number of shares of Common Stock held on an as-if
   converted basis.  No dividends on Convertible Preferred Stock or Common Stock
   have been declared by the Board of Directors from inception to December 31,
   1998 and March 31, 1999 (unaudited), respectively.

   Liquidation
   In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company,
   including a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets where the beneficial
   owners of the Company's Common Stock and Convertible Preferred Stock own less
   than 50% of the resulting voting power of the surviving entity, the holders
   of Series A and B Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to receive an
   amount of $0.50 and $1.28 per share, respectively, plus any declared but
   unpaid dividends prior to and in preference to any distribution to the
   holders of Common Stock. The remaining assets, if any, shall be distributed
   ratably among the holders of Common Stock according to the number of shares
   of Common Stock such holders then hold. Should the Company's legally
   available assets be insufficient to satisfy the liquidation preferences, the
   funds will be distributed ratably among the holders of Series A and B
   Convertible Preferred Stock in proportion to the full preferential amount
   each such holder is entitled to receive. At December 31, 1998 the aggregate
   liquidation preference of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock totaled $110.
   At March 31, 1999 the aggregate liquidation preference of Series A and Series
   B Convertible Preferred Stock totaled $156 and $3,616 (unaudited),
   respectively.


   Conversion
   Each share of Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is
   convertible, at the option of the holder, according to a conversion ratio
   subject to adjustment for dilution. Each share of Series A and B Convertible
   Preferred Stock automatically converts into the number of shares of Common
   Stock into which such shares are convertible at the then effective conversion
   ratio upon: (1) the closing of a public offering of Common Stock at a price
   of at least $3.00 per share with gross proceeds of at least $15,000 (2) a
   merger sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, or other
   transactions which result in a change in control or (3) the consent of the
   holders of the majority of Convertible Preferred Stock.

   At December 31, 1998, the Company reserved 3,173,793 shares of Common Stock
   for the conversion of Series A and B Convertible Preferred Stock.

   Preferred Stock Warrant (unaudited)
   On March 18, 1999, as consideration for entering into an agreement to develop
   a co-branded transaction processing service for individual users on the
   Internet, the Company granted Excite, Inc. a warrant to purchase 550,000
   shares of the Company's Preferred Stock. The warrant has an exercise price of
   $2.60 per share, was fully vested on the grant date and has a term of one
   year from the date of the agreement. Using the Black-Scholes option pricing
   model, the estimated fair value of the warrant totaled $468 which was
   recorded as unearned stock compensation and is being recognized ratably over
   the one year term of the agreement as a charge to sales and marketing
   expense. Amortization of the fair value of the Preferred Stock warrant
   totaled $117 (unaudited) for the three months ended March 31, 1999.
<PAGE>

   Common Stock
   The Company's Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize the Company to
   issue 20,000,000 shares of Common Stock.  A portion of the shares outstanding
   are subject to repurchase by the Company over a four-year period from the
   earlier of the issue date or employee hire date, as applicable.  At December
   31, 1998 and March 31, 1999 there were 5,344,750 and 4,987,500 (unaudited)
   shares, respectively, were subject to repurchase rights.

6. Stock Option Plans (unaudited)

   During 1999, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Plan").
   The Plan provides for the granting of stock options to employees and
   consultants of the Company.  Options granted under the Plan may be either
   incentive stock options ("ISO") or nonqualified stock options ("NSO").  ISOs
   may be granted only to Company employees, including officers and directors
   who are also employees.  NSOs may be granted to Company employees and
   consultants.  The Company has reserved 2,189,091 shares of Common Stock for
   issuance under the Plan.

   Options under the Plan may be granted for periods of up to ten years and at
   prices no less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the
   date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors, provided, however,
   that (i) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO shall not be less than 100%
   and 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant,
   respectively, and (ii) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO granted to a
   10% shareholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of
   the shares on the date of grant. Options are exercisable based on a vesting
   schedule which provides a 25% vest one year after the date of grant and the
   remaining options thereafter in monthly installments over the remaining 36
   months. To date, options granted generally vest over four years. Activity
   under the Plan is as follows:

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors, Stockholders and Members of the
Butterfield & Butterfield Group of Companies

     In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related
combined statements of income, of group equity and of cash flows present fairly,
in all material respects, the combined financial position of the Butterfield &
Butterfield Group of Companies at December 31, 1997 and 1998, and the results of
their combined operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Group's management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

                          BUTTERFIELD & BUTTERFIELD
                              GROUP OF COMPANIES

                    NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     (in thousands except share amounts)

Note 1--The Group and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

    Butterfield & Butterfield

    The Group Companies and Basis of Presentation

     The accompanying combined financial statements include the accounts of
Butterfield & Butterfield Auctioneers Corp. and all affiliated entities under
common control including; Butterfield Credit Corporation Inc., 111 Potrero, LLC
and HBJ Partners, LLC. (collectively the "Group" or "Group Companies"). All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation
of these combined statements.

     Butterfield & Butterfield Auctioneers Corp. ("B&B") - B&B was established
in 1865, incorporated in California in July 1970 and reincorporated in the
state of Delaware in March 1999. B&B conducts auctions and performs appraisal
services of fine art, jewelry, antiques and wine primarily in San Francisco,
Los Angeles and Chicago.

     Butterfield Credit Corporation Inc. ("BCCI") - BCCI is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of B&B and is incorporated in California. BCCI operates as a
financing corporation whose sole purpose is serving B&B's clients.

     111 Potrero Partners, LLC - ("111 Potrero") - 111 Potrero is a limited
liability corporation organized in May 1996. 111 Potrero owns several
commercial properties located in San Francisco and Los Angeles, which are
currently occupied by B&B and third parties.

     HBJ Partners, LLC - ("HBJ") - HBJ is a limited liability corporation
organized in California in September 1996. HBJ owns several commercial
properties located in San Francisco, which are currently occupied by B&B and
third parties. HBJ also has general partnership interests in 111 Santa Fe
Avenue Partners, 2959 Victoria Street Partners and 6700 Cherry Avenue
Partners. Ownership interests in the above partnerships were 58%, 60% and 38%,
respectively.

    Investment in general partnerships
     Interests in general partnerships in which the Group owns more than 50
percent ownership and exerts control are reported under the consolidation
method of accounting; the combined accounts include 100 percent of the assets
and liabilities of these general partnerships and the ownership interests of
minority investors are recorded as "Minority interest in combined companies".
Investments in general partnerships in which the Group owns more than 20
percent are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are recorded
as "Investment in partnerships".

    Use of estimates
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

    Cash and cash equivalents
     The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash
equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of deposits in money market
funds.

    Concentration of credit risk
     Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a
concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and accounts
receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions
that management believes are of high credit quality. The Company's accounts
receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the U.S.
and are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company maintains an allowance for
doubtful accounts receivable based upon the expected collectibility of accounts
receivable. During the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, and the
periods ended March 31, 1998 (unaudited) and 1999 (unaudited) respectively, one
customer accounted for 13.3%, 11.4%, 11.5%, 14.8% (unaudited) and 13.2%
(unaudited), respectively of net revenues. No other customer accounted for more
than 10% of net revenues or net accounts receivable.

    Fair value of financial instruments
     The Company's financial instruments, including cash, cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable and debt are carried at cost, which
approximates their fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
instruments.

    Inventory
     Inventory generally consists of objects obtained as a result of the auction
process or of goods purchased specifically for resale.  Inventory is valued at
the lower of cost, specifically identified, or estimated net realizable value.

    Property and equipment
     Property and equipment are stated at historical cost. Depreciation and
amortization are computed using the straight-line method and accelerated methods
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three years
for computer equipment to 31.5 years for buildings.

    Intangible assets
     Goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of
Dunnings Auction Services, Inc. in June 1998 were estimated by management to be
primarily associated with a covenant not to compete and goodwill and are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives of five and 15 years, respectively.

                                      -6-

    Impairment of long-lived assets
     The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 121, "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of"
("SFAS No. 121"). SFAS No. 121 requires recognition of impairment of long-lived
assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the fair value as
estimated by management based on appraisals, current market value, comparable
sales values and the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to
such assets.

   Environmental expenditures
     Environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are charged to
expense or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing
condition caused by past operations, and that do not contribute to current or
future revenue generation, are charged to expense. Liabilities are recorded when
environmental assessments are made and remediation obligations are probable and
the costs can be reasonably estimated. The timing of these accruals is generally
no later than the completion of feasibility studies.

     HBJ and 111 Potrero own or control numerous real estate properties that are
either used in the auction business or leased to unrelated parties for various
commercial applications. Certain environmental and structural deficiencies have
been identified in the past for which the Company has remediation
responsibility. The amount accrued to correct these matters are based upon
estimates developed in preliminary studies by external consultants. Due to
uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is at least reasonably
possible that as additional information is obtained, the amounts accrued for
these matters may be revised in future periods.

    Revenue recognition
     Auction revenues are derived primarily from auction commissions and fees
from sale of property through the auction process. Revenue from these sources
are recognized at the date the related auction is concluded. Services revenues
are derived from financial, appraisal and other related services which are
recognized as such services are rendered.

    Advertising expense
     The Group Companies incur advertising expenses primarily related to the
distribution of catalogues and advertising for specific auction events.
Advertising expenses are recognized in accordance with Statement of Position
("SOP") 93-7 "Reporting on Advertising Costs." As such, the Group expenses the
costs of producing advertisements at the time production occurs, and expenses
the cost of communicating advertising in the period in which the advertising
space or airtime is used. Advertising expenses totaled $926, $868, $1,337, $197
(unaudited) and $289 (unaudited) during the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997
and 1998, and the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999, respectively.

    Income taxes
     For all periods presented in these combined financial statements, B&B and
BCCI have elected to be taxed as "S" Corporations and therefore, their
respective taxable income or loss have been reported on the shareholders'
individual tax returns. As limited liability corporations, 111 Potrero's and
HBJ's taxable income or loss have also been reported on the members, individual
income tax returns. Accordingly the provison for income taxes is comprised
solely of the California state franchise tax applicable to S Corporations.

    Unaudited interim financial information
     The accompanying interim combined financial statements as of March 31, 1999
and for the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999, are unaudited. The
unaudited interim combined financial statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the annual combined financial statements, and in the opinion of
management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring
adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Group Companies' financial
position, results of operations and cash flows as of March 31, 1999 and for the
three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999. The financial data and other
information disclosed in these notes to the combined financial statements
related to

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

these period are unaudited.  The results for the three months ended March 31,
1999 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year
ending December 31, 1999.

    Comprehensive income
     Effective January 1, 1998, the Group Companies adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 130 "Reporting
Comprehensive Income." SFAS No. 130 establishes the standard for reporting
comprehensive income and its components in financial statements. Comprehensive
income, as defined, includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a
period from non-owner sources. To date, the Group Companies have not had any
transactions that are required to be reported in comprehensive income.

    Recent accounting pronouncements
     In April 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-5 "Reporting on the Costs of
Start-Up Activities." Start-up activities are defined broadly as those
one-time activities related to opening a new facility, introducing a new
product or service, commencing some new operation or organizing a new entity.
Under SOP 98-5, the cost of start-up activities should be expensed as
incurred. SOP 98-5 is effective January 1, 1999 and the Group Companies do not
expect its adoption to have a material effect on their combined results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133
"Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities."  SFAS No. 133 is effective
for all fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter ending June 30, 2000.  SFAS
133 establishes accounting and reporting standards of derivative instruments,
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for
hedging activities. The Group Companies will adopt SFAS No. 133 in July 2000 and
have not assessed the impact of adoption on their combined results of
operations, financial position or cash flows.

</TABLE>

     At December 31, 1997, HBJ maintained a revolving line of credit with a bank
that provided for borrowings of up to $2,000 and is personally guaranteed by the
members. Effective August 1, 1998, the agreement was amended to increase the
amount available to $4,500. The line of credit accrues interest on outstanding
borrowings at a rate equal to the bank's prime rate (8.5% and 7.75% at December
31, 1997 and 1998, respectively).

     B&B and BCCI each maintain a $3,000 bank line of credit which expire on
July 31, 1999 and are each guaranteed by the other party. There were no
outstanding balances at December 31, 1997, 1998 and at March 31, 1999
(unaudited). The lines of credit require compliance with certain financial
covenants and annual profitability. The Companies were in compliance with these
covenants at December 31, 1998 and March 31, 1999 (unaudited). Interest is
generally charged at the Bank's prime rate (8.0% at December 31, 1998) less
 .25%. However, the Company has the option to select from variations of the
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) 5.59% at December 31, 1998) plus 2% for
all or a portion of the outstanding balance for a predetermined loan term of 30
days to one year.

     The mortgage notes outstanding are on property owned by the real estate
general partnerships and are personally guaranteed by the general partners. The
notes have variable interest rates ranging from 7.34% to 8.75% at December 31,
1998 and are secured by certain land, buildings and improvements. The notes are
repayable in equal monthly installments over six to ten year terms, with final
installments consisting of all remaining unpaid principal and accrued interest
at the end of the term.

     During 1997, B&B foreclosed on secured receivables totaling $815 and
assumed a related note payable for $668, plus unpaid property taxes of $27. The
property received in the foreclosure consisted of inventory with estimated value
of $150 and real property recorded at the remaining value of consideration given
of $1,360, which approximates its fair value. The real property has been
classified as asset held for sale on the accompanying combined balance sheet,
because B&B has not used the property in its business operations and has
actively listed the property for sale since the foreclosure date. The related
loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 10.5% and is due in monthly principal and
interest installments of $9.

     In connection with the purchase of Dunnings Auction Services, Inc.,
("Dunnings") (see Note 9), the Company assumed a note payable to the prior
owners in the original amount of $500. The note carries interest at 8.5%, and is
due in two approximately equal installments on June 30, 1999 and 2000.

     In July 1993, an affiliate of HBJ entered into a note payable from a
general partner for $1,800. The note was payable on demand and accrued interest
at an annual rate of 10%. During the first quarter of 1998, the Company paid off
the note in full.

     Notes payable consist of one demand note payable to an individual
totaling $100 at December 31, 1997 with an interest rate of prime and was
repaid during 1998.

     Minimum annual repayments on these notes at December 31, 1998 are as
follows:


     Year ending
     December 31,

     1999...............................  $  4,319

4.   Leasing Arrangements

     HBJ and underlying general partnerships and 111 Potrero's leasing
operations consist principally of the leasing of certain land and buildings.
These leases are classified as operating leases that expire at various intervals
between 1999 and 2010. Certain of these leases contain renewal options and have
escalation clauses tied to changes in CPI. Under the terms of the leases, the
tenants are generally responsible for the payment of property taxes, insurance
and maintenance costs related to the leased property.

     B&B leases space from HBJ and 111 Potrero at market rates. These lease
arrangements have been eliminated in consolidation.

and recognized a gain on the transaction of $200. In August, HBJ also sold the
Parthenia property for $865 in cash and recognized a gain of $133.

6.   Employee Benefit Plans

     The Company has a defined savings contribution plan that covers employees
after one year of service. Under the Plan, participants may elect to contribute
up to 15% of their compensation, up to a maximum amount allowable under IRS
regulations on a pre-tax basis. In addition, the Company may contribute to the
plan up to 25% of the first 2% of each participant's compensation in an amount
determined annually by the Board of Directors. The Company's contributions
amounted to $14, $11, $20 and $5 (unaudited) for the years ended December 31,
1996, 1997, 1998 and for the three month ended March 31, 1999, respectively.

7.   Commitments and Contingencies

    Operating leases
     The Group leases office and warehouse space and equipment under
noncancelable operating leases with varying expiration dates through the year
2005. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998 and for
the three months ended March 31, 1998 and 1999, totaled $5, $5, $58, $1
(unaudited) and $27 (unaudited), respectively.

     Employment Agreement
      In connection with the Dunnings purchase (see Note 9), the Group Companies
entered into employment agreement with a former owner of Dunnings. Under the
agreement, the Group Companies shall continue base salary payments of $175
annually through the November 2001 expiration date in the event of the
employee's death or termination with or without cause. Payments shall cease upon
resignation or termination with cause.

8.   Acquisition

     Effective June 30, 1998, the Group Companies acquired all net assets of
Dunning Auction Services, Inc., an auction house located in Elgin, Illinois. The
acquistion has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and
accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the tangible and
intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their
respective fair values on the date of acquisition.

     The total purchase price of $750 consisted of $250 in cash and the
assumption of $500 in debt. Of the total purchase price, $100 was allocated to
an agreement not to compete and the excess was allocated to goodwill.

     The results of operations are included in the combined financial
statements commencing on July 1, 1998. The pro forma results of operations to
present what the results would have been had the acquisitions actually taken
place at the beginning of the respective periods presented did not result in a
material difference from the reported results of operations.

9.  Operating Segment Reporting

     Effective January 1, 1998, the Group Companies adopted the provisions of
SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related
Information." SFAS No. 131 establishes the standards for reporting information
about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires that
certain selected information about operating segments be reported in interim
financial reports. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about
products and services, and geographic areas. Operating segments are defined as
components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is
evaluated regularly by the chief decision-maker in order to allocate resources
and in assessing performance.

     The Group Companies have identified two primary operating segments: auction
services and real estate. The auction services segment consists of the
operations of B&B and BCCI. The real estate segment consists of the HBJ, 111
Potrero and the various general partnership interests. All segments conducted
their operations solely in the United States.

     Segment selection was based upon the internal organization structure, the
manner in which these operations are managed and their performance evaluated by
management, the availability of separate financial information, and overall
materiality considerations. The operating information for the two segments
identified are as follows:
