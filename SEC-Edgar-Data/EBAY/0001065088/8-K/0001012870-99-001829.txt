ITEM 2.   Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

     On May 25, 1999, eBay Inc. ("eBay") completed an acquisition in which it
acquired Billpoint, Inc. (the "Company"). The Company was acquired pursuant to
an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May 18, 1999
(the "Merger Agreement"), among eBay, the Company and Brazil Acquisition Corp.,
a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay ("Merger Sub"). Pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, Merger Sub was merged with and into the Company, with the Company
being the surviving corporation (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, the
Company became a wholly owed subsidiary of eBay. In connection with the Merger:
(a) eBay issued a total of approximately 525,000 shares of eBay common stock to
the existing shareholders of the Company as consideration for all shares of
capital stock of the Company, and (b) all options and warrants to purchase
shares of common stock of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the
consummation of the Merger were converted into options and warrants to purchase
shares of eBay common stock.

     The Merger was intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization and to be
accounted for as a "pooling of interests." The Company provides transaction
services that enable individual sellers and buyers to use their credit cards
over the Internet to conduct online transactions. eBay intends to continue to
use the assets acquired to conduct such business.

ITEM 7.   Financial Statements and Exhibits.

     a.   If required, financial statements will be filed by amendment as soon
          as practicable.

     b.   If required, pro forma financial information will be filed by
          amendment as soon as practicable.

     c.   Exhibits

          2.1  Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, dated as of May
               18, 1999, among eBay Inc., Brazil Acquisition Corp. and
               Billpoint, Inc.

                              AGREEMENT AND PLAN
                         OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is made
and entered into as of May 18, 1999, by and among EBAY INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"); BRAZIL ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and BILLPOINT, INC., a
California corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this
Agreement are defined in Exhibit A.

                                   Recitals

     A.  Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger
Sub with and into the Company in accordance with this Agreement, the California
General Corporation Law and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Merger").
Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company
will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.

     B.  It is intended that the Merger qualify as a tax-free reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"). For accounting purposes, it is intended that the Merger be
treated as a "pooling of interests."

     C.  This Agreement has been approved by the respective boards of directors
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

     D.  Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain holders of voting capital stock of the Company are executing and
delivering to Parent a voting agreement (a "Voting Agreement") of even date
herewith substantially in the form of Exhibit B.

                                   Agreement

     The parties to this Agreement intending to be legally bound hereby agree as

          Common Stock"). The "Applicable Fraction" shall be the fraction (A)
          having a numerator equal to $125,000,000 and (B) having a denominator
          equal to the amount determined by multiplying (1) the Parent Average
          Stock Price by (2) the Fully Diluted Number of Company Shares; and

               (ii) each share of the common stock (par value $0.001 per share)
          of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
          shall be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving
          Corporation.

          (b)  If any shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or

                                       2
<PAGE>

other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or
other agreement with the Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends.

          (c)  A portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the
Merger shall be delivered into escrow and held as specified in Section 1.8
hereof.

          (d)  In the event Parent at any time or from time to time between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time declares or pays any dividend on
Parent Common Stock payable in Parent Common Stock or in any right to acquire
Parent Common Stock, or effects a subdivision of the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock into a greater number of shares of Parent Common Stock (by
stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like), or in
the event the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock shall be combined or
consolidated, by reclassification or otherwise, into a lesser number of shares
of Parent Common Stock, then the Applicable Fraction shall be appropriately
adjusted.

     1.6  Stock Options and Warrant.

          (a)  At the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of capital
stock of Company that is then outstanding, whether vested or unvested (a
"Company Option"), shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as
in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the Company's 1999 Stock Plan
(the "Stock Plan") and the stock option agreement by which such Company Option
is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under outstanding
Company Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with respect to Parent
Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, (i) each Company
Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common
Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such
assumed Company Option shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Common
Stock that were subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable Fraction, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the per share
exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such
assumed Company Option shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Applicable Fraction, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent and (iv) all
restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall continue
in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and
other provisions of such Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged and
shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions as set
forth in the Company's Stock Plan and/or stock option agreement by which such
Company Option is evidenced immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
however, that each such assumed Company Option shall, in accordance with its
terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar
transaction effected by Parent after the Effective Time. The Company and Parent
shall take all action that may be necessary to effectuate the provisions of this
Section 1.6. Following the Closing, Parent will send to each holder of an
assumed Company

                                       3
<PAGE>

Option a written notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to such assumed Company Option and (ii) the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company
Option. It is the intention of the parties that the Company Options assumed by
Parent qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as
defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent that such Company Options
qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall file with the SEC, no later than coincident with the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement
attached as Exhibit K hereto, a registration statement on Form S-8 registering
the exercise of any Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section
1.6. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such Registration Statement for so long as such Company Options
remain outstanding. Parent shall take all necessary corporate action to reserve
for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of Company Options assumed in accordance with this Section 1.6(a).

          (b)  At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant (if any) that is then
outstanding shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with the terms (as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement) of the instrument by which such Company
Warrant is evidenced. All rights with respect to Company capital stock under
outstanding Company Warrants shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time,
(i) each Company Warrant assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of
Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such assumed Company Warrant shall be equal to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by the Applicable Fraction, rounded down to the
nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock, (iii) the per share
exercise price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such
assumed Company Warrant shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per
share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Warrant, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Applicable Fraction, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent and (iv) all
restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Warrant shall continue
in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability and other provisions of
such Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that
each such assumed Company Warrant shall, in accordance with its terms, be
subject to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction
effected by Parent after the Effective Time. Parent shall take all necessary
corporate action to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Warrants assumed in
accordance with this Section 1.6(b). If, in order to cause the condition set
forth in Section 6.4 to be satisfied, it is necessary to change the form of the
Merger to a merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (with Merger Sub
being the surviving corporation), Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall amend
this Agreement (and take such other actions as are reasonably necessary) to
effect such change in the form of the Merger. In connection with such change,
the parties hereto will execute and deliver representations and certificates in
connection with the tax opinions referenced in Section 7.8 as shall be
reasonably requested by the counsel referred to in Section 7.8, including tax
representation letters that may vary from those set forth in Exhibit N.
                                                             ---------

     1.7  Closing of the Company's Transfer Books'. At the Effective Time,
holders of certificates representing shares of the Company's capital stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as shareholders of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all shares of such capital stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any
such shares of the Company's capital stock shall be made on such stock transfer
books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
certificate previously representing any of such shares of the Company's capital
stock (a "Company Stock Certificate") is presented to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be
exchanged as provided in Section 1.8.

     1.8  Exchange of Certificates; Escrow Shares.

          (a)  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall reserve for
exchange in accordance with this Section 1, (i) the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.5 in exchange for
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash for fractional shares
in the amount described in Section 1.8(c). At the Closing, each Company
shareholder that does not perfect its dissenters' rights and is otherwise
entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5 (a
"Merger Shareholder") shall surrender to Parent all certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock (properly endorsed for transfer). At or as soon
as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall caused to be (i) delivered
to each Merger Shareholder a certificate representing 90 percent of the number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such Merger Shareholder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.5 and (ii) delivered to
the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto (the
"Escrow Agreement"), on behalf and in the name of each Merger Shareholder, a
certificate representing 10 percent of the number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such Merger Shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of Section 1.5 (the "Escrow Shares"). With respect to those
Merger Shareholders whose shares of Company Common Stock are subject to a
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement, the number of Escrow Shares deposited on
behalf of each such Merger Shareholder shall be prorated between such Merger
Shareholder's Unreleased Shares and shares that have been released from the
Company's Repurchase Option (as such terms are defined in the respective
Restricted Stock Purchase Agreements) based on the number of shares that
constitute Unreleased Shares and the number of shares that have been so released
as of the Effective Time. If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common Stock, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate to provide an
appropriate affidavit and indemnity agreement against any claim that may be made
against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock
Certificate.

          (b)  No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu
of any fractional share shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder
surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in accordance with

                                       5
<PAGE>

this Section 1.8 (at which time such holder shall be entitled receive all such
dividends and distributions and such cash payment).

          (c)  No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such fractional shares
shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of capital stock
of the Company who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable to such holder) shall, upon surrender of such holder's Company
Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest
whole cent), without interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the
average of the closing sale prices of a share of Parent Common Stock as reported
on the Nasdaq National Market for each of the five consecutive trading days
ending on the trading day immediately preceding the Closing.

          (d)  The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
shall be characterized as "restricted securities" for purposes of Rule 144 under
the Securities Act, and each certificate representing any such shares shall,
until such time that the shares are not so restricted under the Securities Act,
bear a legend identical or similar in effect to the following legend (together
with any other legend or legends required by applicable state securities laws or
otherwise, if any):

          "THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED
          UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED,
          SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED
          UNLESS REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
          REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE ACT IS AVAILABLE."

          (e)  Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any
holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may be required to
deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been
paid.

          (f)  Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to
any holder or former holder of capital stock of the Company for any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for
any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

          (g)  The Escrow Shares shall be maintained in an Escrow Fund (the
"Escrow Fund") for purposes of satisfying claims brought pursuant to Section 9
and for the period of time set forth in such Section.

                                       6

     1.9   Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the
Effective Time, are or may become "dissenting shares" within the meaning of
Section 1300(b) of the California General Corporation Law shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with
Section 1.5 (or cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.8(c)), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such
rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in the California General
Corporation Law; provided, however, that if the status of any such shares as
"dissenting shares" shall not be perfected, or if any such shares shall lose
their status as "dissenting shares," then, as of the later of the Effective Time
or the time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss of such status,
such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the
right to receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares) Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5
(and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.8(c)).

     1.10  Tax Consequences. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the
United States Treasury Regulations.

     1.11  Accounting Treatment. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended
to be treated as a "pooling of interests."

     1.12  Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation or Parent with
full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property of Merger Sub
and the Company, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the
Company and otherwise) to take such action.

this Agreement) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors. No vote of
Parent's stockholders is needed to approve the Merger. This Agreement has been

     3.3  No Conflict; Consents. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by Parent and

provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub,
or of any Legal Requirement or any provision of any Contract to which Parent or
Merger Sub is a party, except where any of the foregoing would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the business,

to the Company true and complete copies of, all forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required to be filed by it and its subsidiaries
since October 1, 1998 under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates or, if
amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents and
any forms, reports, schedules, statements and other documents Parent may file
with the SEC subsequent to the date hereof until the Closing, including, without
limitation, any financial statements or schedules included therein, complied or
will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act as the Exchange Act, and did and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were or will be made, not misleading. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets (including the related notes) included in the
Parent SEC Documents fairly presented in all material respects the financial
position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates
thereof, and the other related statements (including the related

                                       21
<PAGE>

notes) included in the Parent SEC Documents has been prepared in all material

normal year-end adjustments.

this Agreement and, if applicable, upon exercise of the Company Warrant assumed
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement will, when issued in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.

included in Parent's most recently filed report on Form 10-Q and the date of
this Agreement, except as disclosed in Parent's most recently filed report on
Form 10-Q, there has not occurred any material adverse change in the business,
financial condition or results of operations of Parent. For purposes of this
section, a change in the trading price of Parent's Common Stock, as reported by
the Nasdaq National Market or any other automated quotation system or exchange,
changes in economic conditions or changes in the industry and markets in which
Parent competes shall not constitute a material adverse change, whether
occurring at any time or from time to time.

     3.7  Legal Proceedings. There is no pending Legal Proceeding, and to the
knowledge of Parent, no Person has threatened to commence any Legal Proceeding,
that challenges, or that may have the effect of preventing, delaying, making
illegal or otherwise interfering with, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     3.8  Merger Sub.  Merger Sub has been formed solely for the purpose of
executing and delivering this Agreement and consummating the transactions

other than activities related to its corporate organization and the execution

offer letters setting forth the specific terms of their employment. Those

affiliates, including the Company, following the Closing would, subject to any
necessary transition period and the terms of such plans, be eligible to
participate in Parent's health, vacation, employee stock purchase, 401(k) and
other plans, to the same extent as comparably situated employees of Parent and
would receive credit under Parent's benefit plans for service as an employee of
the Company. For not less than one year following the Closing Date, Parent shall
maintain, or shall cause the Company, to maintain, compensation and employee
benefit plans and arrangements and perquisites for those persons who remain
employees of the Company after the Closing Date that, in the aggregate, are
substantially comparable to (or more favorable than) those provided pursuant to

respect, an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by

circumstance that occurs, arises or exists after the date of this Agreement and

the occurrence, existence or discovery of such event, condition, fact or
circumstance or (B) such event, condition, fact or circumstance had occurred,
arisen or existed on or prior to the date of this Agreement; (iii) any breach of
any covenant or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub; and (iv) any event,

opinion of its respective counsel to such effect as contemplated by Section 7.8.
Parent and the Company shall each execute and deliver the tax representation
letters in the form of Exhibit N. From and after the Effective Time, neither

     subsequent date (as if made on such subsequent date), or if any of the
     Company's covenants contained in this Agreement shall have been breached in
     any material respect, in either case such that the condition set forth in

     Company's representations and warranties that is curable by the Company or
     on account of a breach of a covenant by the Company that is curable by the
     Company unless the Company fails to cure such inaccuracy or breach within
     30 days after receiving written notice from Parent of such inaccuracy or
     breach;

          (b)  by the Company if any of Parent's representations and warranties
     contained in this Agreement shall have been materially inaccurate as of the
     date of this Agreement or shall have become materially inaccurate as of any
     subsequent date (as if made on such subsequent date), or if any of Parent's
     covenants contained in this Agreement shall have been breached in any
     material respect, in either case such that the condition set forth in
     either Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, as the case may be, would not be
     satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
     representation or warranty shall have become inaccurate; provided, however,
     that the Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)
     on account of an inaccuracy in Parent's representations and warranties that
     is curable by Parent or on account of a breach of a covenant by Parent that
     is curable by Parent unless Parent fails to cure such inaccuracy or breach
     within 30 days after receiving written notice from the Company of such
     inaccuracy or breach;

          (c)  by Parent if the Closing has not taken place on or before July
     31, 1999 (other than as a result of any failure on the part of Parent or
     Merger Sub to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of Parent
     or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement or
     instrument delivered to the Company);

          (d)  by the Company if the Closing has not taken place on or before
     July 31, 1999 (other than as a result of the failure on the part of the
     Company to comply with or perform any covenant or obligation of the Company
     set forth in this Agreement or in any other agreement or instrument
     delivered to Parent);

          (e)  by either Parent or the Company if a court of competent
     jurisdiction or other Governmental Body shall have issued a final and
     nonappealable order, decree or ruling, or shall have taken any other
     action, having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or
     otherwise prohibiting the Merger; or

          (f)  by the mutual written consent of Parent and the Company.

     8.2  Termination Procedures. If Parent wishes to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(c), Parent shall deliver to the
Company a written notice stating that Parent is terminating this Agreement and
setting forth a brief description of the basis on which Parent is terminating

<PAGE>

     8.3   Effect of Termination.  If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1 and 8.2, all further obligations of the parties under this Agreement
shall terminate; provided, however, that: (a) none of the parties shall be
relieved of any obligation or liability arising from any prior willful breach by
such party of any provision of this Agreement and (b) the parties shall, in all
events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the provisions set forth

SECTION 9. Indemnification, Etc.

      9.1  Survival of Representations, Etc.

           (a)  The representations and warranties made by the Company
(including the representations and warranties set forth in Section 2) shall
survive the Closing and shall expire on (i) the earlier of the first anniversary
of the Closing Date or the date of the audit report on the first financial
statements of Parent containing combined operations of the Company and Parent
for those representations related to matters expected to be encountered in the
audit process and (ii) the first anniversary of the Closing Date for other
matters (the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that if, at any time prior
to the Termination Date, any Indemnitee (acting in good faith) delivers to the
Shareholders' Agent a written notice alleging the existence of an inaccuracy in
or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company
(and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such Indemnitee's belief
that such an inaccuracy or breach may exist) and asserting a claim for recovery
under Section 9.2 based on such alleged inaccuracy or breach, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Termination Date until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved. All representations and warranties
made by Parent and Merger Sub shall terminate and expire as of the Closing Date,
and any liability of Parent or Merger Sub with respect to such representations
and warranties shall thereupon cease.

           (b)  The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations of
the Company, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the
Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or as a result of any
information furnished to, or any investigation made by or knowledge of, any of
the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

           (c)  For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or other item of
information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or in any update to the
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty made by
the Company in this Agreement.

     9.2   Indemnification.

           (a)  From and after the Closing Date (but subject to Section 9.1(a),
9.2(b), 9.3 and the other limitations set forth in this Section 9), the
shareholders of the Company who shall have received, or shall be entitled to
receive, Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.5 of this Agreement (the
"Indemnitors"), severally (and not jointly) and in proportion to their original
contributions to the Escrow Fund, shall hold harmless and indemnify each of the
Indemnitees from and against, and the Escrow Shares shall be available to
compensate and reimburse each of

                                      35
<PAGE>

the Indemnitees for, any Damages that are directly or indirectly suffered or
incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees may
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third-party claim) and that arise from or as a result of, or are directly or
indirectly connected with: (i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty set forth in Section 2 (as modified by the Disclosure Schedule)
(without giving effect to any "Material Adverse Effect" or other materiality
qualification or any similar qualification contained or incorporated directly or
indirectly in such representation or warranty, and without giving effect to any
update to the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing); (ii) any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty set forth in Section 2 (as modified by
the Disclosure Schedule) as if such representation and warranty had been made on
and as of the Closing Date (without giving effect to any "Material Adverse
Effect" or other materiality qualification or any similar qualification
contained or incorporated directly or indirectly in such representation or
warranty, but giving effect to any update to the Disclosure Schedule delivered
by the Company to Parent prior to the Closing to the extent that Parent would be
entitled to terminate this Agreement as a result of such update); (iii) any
breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company contained in this Agreement
(including the covenants set forth in Sections 4 and 5); or (iv) any Legal
Proceeding relating to any inaccuracy or breach of the type referred to in
clause "(i)," "(ii)" or "(iii)" above (including any Legal Proceeding commenced
by any Indemnitee for the purpose of enforcing any of its rights under this
Section 9); provided, however, that, except as set forth in Section 9.3 with
respect to claims based upon fraud, the aggregate amount for which the
Indemnitors are required to indemnify the Indemnitees pursuant to this Section
9.2 will not exceed the amount of Escrow Shares held in the Escrow Fund.

          (b)  Deductible. The Indemnitors shall not be required to make any
indemnification payment pursuant to Section 9.2(a) until such time as the total
amount of all Damages (including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or
breach and all other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies in or breaches
of any representations or warranties) that have been directly or indirectly
suffered or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one
or more of the Indemnitees has or have otherwise become subject, exceeds
$250,000 in the aggregate. If the total amount of such Damages exceeds $250,000,
then the Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified against and compensated
and reimbursed only for the portion of such Damages exceeding $250,000.

     9.3  Exclusive Remedy.   With the exception of claims based upon fraud,
from and after the Closing, recourse of Parent to the Escrow Shares pursuant to
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Parent and the other Indemnitees for damages under the indemnification
provisions contained in, and for any breach of, this Agreement (it being
understood that nothing in this Section 9.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
effect Parent's rights to specific performance or other similar equitable
remedies with respect to covenants referred to in this Agreement to be performed
after the Closing). Any Escrow Shares released from the Escrow Fund to an
Indemnitee (other than pursuant to Section 3(h) of the Escrow Agreement) shall
be deemed to reduce the Escrow Shares pro rata with respect to each Merger
Shareholder in accordance with each Merger Shareholder's percentage interest in
the Escrow Fund as set forth in Exhibit B to the Escrow Agreement.

                                      36
<PAGE>

     9.4    No Contribution. No shareholder of the Company shall have any right
of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Merger Sub
or the Company in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other
liability to which she, he or it may become subject under or in connection with
this Agreement.


     9.5    Defense Of Third Party Claims.  In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against
Merger Sub or the Company, against Parent or against any other Person) with
respect to which any of the Indemnitors may, in Parent's reasonable judgment,
become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its
election, to proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its
own.  The Merger Shareholders shall be entitled, at their expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding.  If Parent so
proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

            (a)  each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents
     and materials in his or its possession or control that may be necessary to
     the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and

            (b)  Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise
     such claim or Legal Proceeding only with the consent of the Shareholders'
     Agent (as defined in Section 10.1); provided, however, that such consent
     shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Parent shall give the Shareholders' Agent prompt notice of the commencement of
any such Legal Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company; provided,
however, any failure on the part of Parent to so notify the Shareholders' Agent
shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnitors under this Section 9
(except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of such
Legal Proceeding).  If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any
such claim or Legal Proceeding, the Shareholders' Agent may proceed with the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to Parent; provided, however, that the Shareholders' Agent may not settle,
adjust or compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld).

SECTION 10.    Miscellaneous Provisions

     10.1   Shareholders' Agent. By virtue of their approval of the Merger and
this Agreement, the Merger Shareholders shall have approved, among other
matters, the indemnification and escrow terms set forth in Section 9 and shall
irrevocably appoint Mark A. Stevens as their agent for purposes of Section 9
(the "Shareholders' Agent") to give and receive notices and communications, to
authorize delivery to Parent of Parent Common Stock, cash or other property from
the Escrow Fund, to object to such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, and demand dispute resolution pursuant to
Section 3 of the Escrow Agreement and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to indemnification claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholders' Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Mark A. Stevens hereby accepts his appointment
as the Shareholders' Agent. Parent shall be entitled to deal

                                       37

exclusively with the Shareholders' Agent on all matters relating to Section 9,
and shall be entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Indemnitor by the Shareholders' Agent, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Indemnitor by the Shareholders' Agent, as
fully binding upon such Indemnitor. If the Shareholders' Agent shall die, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities as agent of the
Indemnitors, then the Indemnitors shall, within ten days after such death or
disability, appoint a successor agent and, promptly thereafter, shall notify
Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall become the
"Shareholders' Agent" for purposes of Section 9 and this Section 10.1. If for
any reason there is no Shareholders' Agent at any time, all references herein to
the Shareholders' Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Indemnitors. The
Shareholders' Agent shall not be responsible for any act done or omitted
thereunder as Shareholders' Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise
of reasonable judgment. The Merger Shareholders shall jointly and severally
indemnify the Shareholders' Agent and hold the Shareholders' Agent harmless
against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Shareholders' Agent and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Shareholders' Agent's duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of any legal counsel or other professional retained by the
Shareholders' Agent. By virtue of their approval of the Merger and this
Agreement, the Merger Shareholders hereby agree to pay all costs and expenses,
including those of any legal counsel or other professional retained by the
Shareholders' Agent, in connection with the acceptance and administration of the
Shareholders' Agent's duties hereunder. Subject to the prior right of Parent to
make claims for Damages, the Shareholders' Agent shall have the right to recover
from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Merger Shareholders, any
costs and expenses, including those of any legal counsel or other professional
retained by the Shareholders' Agent, in connection with the acceptance and
administration of the Shareholders' Agent's duties hereunder.

     10.2  Further Assurances.  Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents, and
shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request (prior
to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out or evidencing any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     10.3  Fees And Expenses.  Each party to this Agreement shall bear and pay
all fees, costs and expenses (including legal fees and accounting fees) that
have been incurred or that are incurred by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     10.4  Attorneys' Fees.  If any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of this Agreement is brought
against any party hereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements (in addition to any other
relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled).

     10.5  Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to
be delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be

forth in this Agreement for the benefit of any other party to this Agreement,
such other party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be

right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.  No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising
out of this Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on
behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any
effect except in the specific instance in which it is given.

     10.13  Amendments.  This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered
or supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of all of the parties hereto.

     10.14  Severability.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application of any such provision to any Person or set of circumstances,
shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any
extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such provision
to Persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be
invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise
affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

     10.15  Parties in interest.  Except for the provisions of Sections 1.5 and
10.1, none of the provisions of this Agreement is intended to provide any rights
or remedies to any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, if any.

Closing Date or (b) the date on which such Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms.
