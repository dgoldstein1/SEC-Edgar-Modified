                    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (Unaudited)
                                        
1. Basis of Presentation

   Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell
Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic). The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange
Commission rules that permit reduced disclosure for interim periods.  These
financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a fair
presentation of results of operations and financial position for the interim
periods shown including normal recurring accruals. The results for the interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.  For a more
complete discussion of significant accounting policies and certain other
information, you should refer to the financial statements included in our 1998
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

   We have reclassified certain amounts from prior year's data to conform to the
1999 presentation.

2. Dividend

   On May 3, 1999, we declared and paid a dividend in the amount of $98.1
million to Bell Atlantic.

3. Transfer of Directory Publishing Activities

   On March 1, 1998, we transferred, at net book value without gain or loss,
certain assets and liabilities associated with our directory publishing
activities to a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary. The stock of the newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary was immediately distributed to Bell Atlantic.
The transfer of such assets and liabilities was completed as part of our and
Bell Atlantic's response to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, which prohibits us from engaging in electronic publishing or joint sales
and marketing of electronic products.

   Net assets that we transferred totaled approximately $2 million, and
consisted of deferred directory production costs (included in prepaid expenses),
fixed assets and related deferred tax liabilities.

   Revenues related to the directory publishing activities we transferred were
approximately $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 1998.  Direct
expenses related to the directory publishing activities we transferred were
approximately $18 million for the same period.  We do not separately identify
indirect expenses attributable to the directory publishing activities, including
expenses related to billing and data management and processing services, legal,
external affairs, depreciation, interest expense and any corresponding tax
expense.

   Effective March 1, 1998, we no longer earned revenues from directory
publishing activities that we transferred, and we no longer incurred the related
expenses.  We continue to earn certain other revenues, primarily fees for
nonpublication of telephone numbers and multiple white page listings.
Additionally, contracts between us and another affiliate of Bell Atlantic for
billing and collection services related to the directory activities, use of
directory listings, and rental charges have created new revenues sources for us.

4. New Accounting Standards

Costs of Computer Software

   Effective January 1, 1999, we adopted Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1,
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use."  Under SOP No. 98-1, we capitalize the cost of internal-use
software which has a useful life in excess of one year.  Such costs sometimes
include payroll-related costs for internally developed software. Subsequent
additions, modifications or upgrades to internal-use software are capitalized
only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it currently
does not perform.  Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the
period in which they are incurred. Also, we now capitalize interest associated
with the development of internal-use software.

                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

Costs of Start-Up Activities

   Effective January 1, 1999, we adopted SOP No. 98-5, "Reporting on the Costs
of Start-up Activities."  Under this accounting standard, we expense costs of
start-up activities as incurred, including pre-operating, pre-opening and other
organizational costs.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement requires that all
derivatives be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet. Changes in the fair values of derivative
instruments will be recognized in either earnings or comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use and effectiveness of the instruments. We must
adopt SFAS No. 133 no later than January 1, 2000. The adoption of SFAS No. 133
will have no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
because we currently do not enter into the use of derivative instruments or
participate in hedging activities.

</TABLE>

      Net income and comprehensive income were the same for the three months
ended March 31, 1999 and 1998.
 
6.    Litigation and Other Contingencies

   Various legal actions and regulatory proceedings are pending to which we are
a party.  We have established reserves for specific liabilities in connection
with regulatory and legal matters that we currently deem to be probable and
estimable.  We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of pending regulatory
and legal matters in future periods will have a material effect on our financial
condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations.

7. Proposed Bell Atlantic - GTE Merger

   Bell Atlantic and GTE Corporation (GTE) have announced a proposed merger of
equals under a definitive merger agreement dated as of July 27, 1998.  Under the
terms of the agreement, GTE shareholders will receive 1.22 shares of Bell
Atlantic common stock for each share of GTE common stock that they own.  Bell
Atlantic shareholders will continue to own their existing shares after the
merger.

   It is expected that the merger will qualify as a pooling of interests, which
means that for accounting and financial reporting purposes the companies will be
treated as if they had always been combined.  The completion of the merger is
subject to a number of conditions, including certain regulatory approvals,
receipt of opinions that the merger will be tax-free, and the approval of the
shareholders of both Bell Atlantic and GTE.  Special meetings to vote on the
merger will be held on May 18, 1999 for GTE shareholders and on May 19, 1999 for
Bell Atlantic shareholders.

   Bell Atlantic and GTE are working diligently to complete the merger by the
end of 1999.  However, the companies must obtain the approval of a variety of
state and federal regulatory agencies and, accordingly, the merger may close in
the first half of 2000.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
         (Abbreviated pursuant to General Instruction H(2).)

   This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements
and Notes to Financial Statements.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

   We reported net income of $156.7 million for the three month period ended
March 31, 1999, compared to net income of $144.2 million for the same period in
1998.

   Our results for 1999 and 1998 were affected by special items.  The special
items in both periods include our allocated share of charges from Bell Atlantic
Network Services, Inc. (NSI).  Results for 1998 also included the effect of
transferring certain assets and liabilities of our directory publishing
activities to a subsidiary, as described below.

   The following table shows how special items are reflected in our condensed
statements of income for each period:

Merger-related Costs

   In connection with the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger, which was completed in
August 1997, we recorded pre-tax transition and integration costs of $2.0
million in the first quarter of 1999 and $.4 million in the first quarter of
1998.

   Transition and integration costs consist of our proportionate share of costs
associated with integrating the operations of Bell Atlantic and NYNEX, such as
systems modifications costs and advertising and branding costs.  Transition and
integration costs are expensed as incurred.

Transfer of Directory Publishing Activities

   On March 1, 1998, we transferred, at net book value without gain or loss,
certain assets and liabilities associated with our directory publishing
activities to a newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary. The stock of the newly
formed, wholly owned subsidiary was immediately distributed to Bell Atlantic.
The transfer of such assets and liabilities was completed as part of our and
Bell Atlantic's response to the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of
1996 (1996 Act), which prohibits us from engaging in electronic publishing or
joint sales and marketing of electronic products.

LOCAL SERVICES REVENUES

   1999 - 1998                         Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   First Quarter                $20.6           5.5%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Local services revenues are earned from the provision of local exchange,
local private line, public telephone (pay phone) and value-added services. 
Value-added services are a family of services that expand the utilization of the
network. These services include products such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and
Return Call.

   Growth in local services revenues in the first quarter of 1999 was primarily
due to higher usage of our network facilities. This growth was generated by an
increase in access lines in service of 5.8% from March 31, 1998.  Access line
growth primarily reflects higher demand for Centrex services and an increase in
additional residential lines.

   Local services revenue growth in the first quarter of 1999 also reflects
strong customer demand and usage of our data transport and digital services.
Revenues from our value-added services were boosted in the first quarter by
marketing and promotional campaigns offering new service packages.

   First Quarter                $28.4           10.0%

   Network access services revenues are earned from end-user subscribers and
long distance and other competing carriers who use our local exchange facilities
to provide usage services to their customers.  Switched access revenues are
derived from fixed and usage-based charges paid by carriers for access to our
local network.  Special access revenues originate from carriers and end-users
that buy dedicated local exchange capacity to support their private networks.
End-user access revenues are earned from our customers and from resellers who
purchase dial-tone services.

   Network access services revenue growth in the first quarter of 1999 was
mainly attributable to higher customer demand, as reflected by growth in access
minutes of use of 9.4% from the first quarter of 1998. Volume growth also
reflects a continuing expansion of the business market, particularly for high-
capacity services. In the first three months of 1999, demand for special access
services was higher, reflecting a greater utilization of our network by Internet
service providers and other high-capacity users. Higher network usage by
alternative providers of intraLATA toll services and higher end-user revenues
attributable to an increase in access lines in service also contributed to
revenue growth in the first quarter of 1999.

   Volume-related growth was partially offset by net price reductions mandated
by a federal price cap plan.  The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
regulates the rates that we charge long distance carriers and end-user
subscribers for interstate access services.  We are required to file new access
rates with the FCC each year under the rules of the Price Cap Plan.

   In July 1998, we implemented interstate price decreases of approximately $14
million on an annual basis. These rates included amounts necessary to recover
our contribution to the FCC's universal service fund. The FCC has created a
multi-billion dollar interstate fund to link schools and libraries to the
Internet and to subsidize low-income customers and rural health care providers.
Under the FCC's rules, all providers of interstate telecommunications services
must contribute to the fund. Our contributions to the universal service fund are
included in Other Operating Expenses. Our rates are subject to change every
quarter due to potential increases or decreases in our contribution to the
universal service fund. Changes in required contributions to that fund increased
rates by approximately $.7 million on an annual basis in October 1998 and
decreased rates by approximately $.6 million annually in April 1999. Rates were
increased by approximately $8 million on an annual basis in January 1999 to
reflect primarily the unification of pre-merger Bell Atlantic and NYNEX access
rates. These rates will be in effect through June 1999.


LONG DISTANCE SERVICES REVENUES

   1999 - 1998                         (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   First Quarter                $(2.9)          (2.2)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Long distance services revenues are earned primarily from calls made to
points outside a customer's local calling area, but within our service area
(intraLATA toll). Other long distance services that we provide include 800
services, Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS), and corridor services (between
LATAs in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and between LATAs in northern New
Jersey and New York City).

   The decline in long distance services revenues was due to the competitive
effects of presubscription for intraLATA toll services. Presubscription, which
permits customers to use an alternative provider of their choice for intraLATA
toll calls without dialing a special access code when placing a call, was
introduced in 1997. In response to presubscription, we have implemented customer
win-back and retention initiatives that include toll calling discount packages
and product bundling offers. The adverse impact on long distance revenues as a
result of presubscription was partially mitigated by increased network access
services revenues for usage of our network by these alternative providers. These
revenue reductions were partially offset by additional revenues generated from
higher calling volumes.

ANCILLARY SERVICES REVENUES

   1999 - 1998                        (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   First Quarter               $(46.5)          (39.3)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Our ancillary services include such services as billing and collections for
long distance carriers and affiliates, facilities rentals to affiliates and
nonaffiliates, collocation and usage of separately priced (unbundled) components
of our network by competitive local exchange carriers, voice messaging, customer
premises equipment (CPE) and wiring and maintenance services, and sales of
materials and supplies to affiliates.

   As described earlier, we transferred certain assets and liabilities
associated with our directory publishing activities to a newly formed, wholly
owned subsidiary, effective March 1, 1998.  As a result, we no longer earn
revenues associated with the directory publishing activities transferred.
Beginning March 1, 1998, our ancillary services revenues include directory
services revenues earned primarily from fees paid by customers for
nonpublication of telephone numbers and multiple white page listings and fees
paid by an affiliate for usage of our directory listings.

   The decrease in ancillary services revenues in 1999 was principally due to
the effect of the transfer of directory publishing activities and the
recognition in 1998 of revenues associated with a marketing program.

   These revenue decreases were partially offset by increased demand by long
distance carriers and affiliates for billing and collection services and
increased facilities rental revenues from affiliates.

EMPLOYEE COSTS

   1999 - 1998                        (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   First Quarter                $(4.8)          (2.8)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Employee costs consist of salaries, wages and other employee compensation,
employee benefits and payroll taxes paid directly by us.  Similar costs incurred
by employees of NSI, who provide centralized services on a contract basis, are
allocated to us and are included in Other Operating Expenses.

   Employee costs decreased in the first quarter of 1999 primarily as a result
of lower pension and benefit costs.  The reduction in pension and benefit costs
was due to a number of factors, including lower pension costs as a result of
favorable pension plan investment returns and changes in plan provisions and
actuarial assumptions.  These factors were offset, in part, by higher savings
plan contributions, increased healthcare costs caused by inflation, and benefit
plan improvements provided for under new contracts with associate employees. The
effect of lower work force levels also contributed to the decline in employee
costs.

   These cost reductions were partially offset by the effect of annual salary
and wage increases for management and associate employees and by higher expense
generated by an increase in repair and maintenance activity.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

   1999 - 1998                         Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   First Quarter                $10.0           5.7%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the first quarter of 1999
over the same period in 1998 principally as a result of growth in depreciable
telephone plant and changes in the mix of plant assets.  The adoption of
Statement of Position (SOP) No. 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer
Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use" also contributed to the
increase in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 1999,
but to a lesser extent.  Under this new accounting standard, computer software
developed or obtained for internal use is now capitalized and amortized.
Previously, we expensed most of these software purchases as incurred.  For
additional information on SOP No. 98-1, see Note 4 to the condensed financial
statements.

   These increases were partially offset by the effect of lower rates of
depreciation and amortization.


OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

   1999 - 1998                        (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   First Quarter               $(27.5)          (9.4)%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Other operating expenses consist of contract services including centralized
services expenses allocated from NSI, rent, network software costs, operating
taxes other than income, the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable,
and other costs.

   As a result of the transfer of directory publishing activities in March 1998,
we no longer incur certain direct and allocated expenses related to the
activities that we transferred.

   The decrease in other operating expenses in the first quarter of 1999 was
largely attributable to the transfer of directory publishing activities and the
adoption of SOP No. 98-1. Lower purchases of routine maintenance software, which
is expensed as incurred, further contributed to the decline in other operating
expenses.

   These decreases were offset, in part, by higher property taxes and by higher
interconnection (reciprocal compensation) payments to competitive local exchange
and other carriers to terminate calls on their networks.  Certain competitive
local exchange carriers with which we have interconnection agreements have
requested payment for "reciprocal compensation" to terminate calls on their
networks, including a large volume of one-way traffic from our customers to
internet service providers that are their customers.  On February 26, 1999, the
FCC confirmed that such traffic is interstate and interexchange in nature and
not subject to the reciprocal compensation requirements of the 1996 Act.  In
addition, virtually all of this traffic is not subject to the reciprocal
compensation provisions of the various interconnection agreements because,
whether or not it is interstate, it is not local traffic.  This issue is before
the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) in two pending matters. The FCC
also has initiated a proceeding to consider adopting rules governing inter-
carrier compensation for this traffic in the future.


OTHER INCOME, NET

   First Quarter                  $.2           33.3%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   The change in other income, net, was attributable to additional interest
income, principally from our short-term investments.

INTEREST EXPENSE

   1999 - 1998                         Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   First Quarter                  $.1           .4%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


   Interest expense includes costs associated with borrowings and capital
leases, net of interest capitalized as a cost of acquiring or constructing plant
assets.

   Interest expense increased in the first quarter of 1999 over the same period
in 1998 principally due to a reduction in capitalized interest costs resulting
from lower levels of average telephone plant under construction.  This increase
was substantially offset by the effect of lower interest rates on average short-
term debt.


EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES

   Three Months Ended March 31
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1999                                 40.8%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1998                                 40.6%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The effective income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a
percentage of income before the provision for income taxes.  Our effective
income tax rate was higher in the first quarter of 1999 principally due to
income tax credits recorded in 1998.



FINANCIAL CONDITION
- -------------------

   We use the net cash generated from operations and from external financing to
fund capital expenditures for network expansion and modernization, and pay
dividends.  While current liabilities exceeded current assets at both March 31,
1999 and 1998 and December 31, 1998, our sources of funds, primarily from
operations and, to the extent necessary, from readily available financing
arrangements with an affiliate, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating
requirements. Management expects that presently foreseeable capital requirements
will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds.
Additional long-term debt may be needed to fund development activities or to
maintain our capital structure to ensure financial flexibility.

   As of March 31, 1999, we had $395.0 million of an unused line of credit with
an affiliate, Bell Atlantic Network Funding Corporation.  In addition, we had
$50.0 million remaining under a shelf registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of unsecured debt
securities.  Our debt securities continue to be accorded high ratings by primary
rating agencies.  Subsequent to the announcement of the Bell Atlantic - GTE
merger, rating agencies have maintained current credit ratings, but have placed
our ratings under review for potential downgrade.

   Our debt ratio was 47.6% at March 31, 1999, compared to 48.2% at March 31,
1998 and 48.5% at December 31, 1998.

   On May 3, 1999, we declared and paid a dividend in the amount of $98.1
million to Bell Atlantic.



OTHER MATTERS

Recent Accounting Pronouncement - Derivatives and Hedging Activities

   In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This statement requires that all
derivatives be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet.  Changes in the fair values of the derivative
instruments will be recognized in either earnings or comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use and effectiveness of the instruments.  We must
adopt SFAS No. 133 no later than January 1, 2000.  The adoption of SFAS No. 133
will have no material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
because we currently do not enter into the use of derivative instruments or
participate in hedging activities.

Year "2000" Update

   Bell Atlantic has a comprehensive program to evaluate and address the impact
of the Year 2000 date transition on its subsidiaries' operations, including our
operations.  This program includes steps to:

   .  inventory and assess for Year 2000 compliance our equipment, software and
      systems;

   .  determine whether to remediate, replace or retire noncompliant items, and
      establish a plan to accomplish these steps;

   .  remediate, replace or retire the items;

   .  test the items, where required; and

   .  provide management with reporting and issues management to support a
      seamless transition to the Year 2000.

State of Readiness

   For Bell Atlantic's operating telephone subsidiaries, centralized services
   entities and general corporate operations, the program focuses on the
   following project groups: Network Elements, Applications and Support Systems,
   and Information Technology Infrastructure.  At this time, Bell Atlantic has
   virtually completed the inventory, assessment and detailed planning phases
   for these projects. Remediation/replacement/retirement and testing activities
   are well underway. Bell Atlantic plans to fix, replace or retire those items
   that were not Year 2000 compliant and that require action to avoid service
   impact.  Bell Atlantic's goal for these operations is to have its network and
   other mission critical systems Year 2000 compliant (including testing) by
   June 30, 1999.  Bell Atlantic is on schedule to achieve this goal for
   substantially all of its network and other mission critical systems.  What
   follows is a more detailed breakdown of Bell Atlantic's efforts to date.

 .  Network Elements

   Approximately 350 different types of network elements (such as central office
   switches) appear in over one hundred thousand instances.  When combined in
   various ways and using network application systems, these elements are the
   building blocks of customer services and networked information transmission
   of all kinds.  Bell Atlantic originally assessed approximately 70% of these
   element types, representing over 90% of all deployed network elements, as
   Year 2000 compliant.  Late in 1998, through additional testing and
   verification, it determined that certain network elements, originally
   represented as having no Year 2000-related service impact, were likely to
   cause service issues unless remediated.  As a result, Bell Atlantic had an
   increase in the overall number of network elements requiring repair.
   Notwithstanding the additional work effort, as of March 31, 1999, Bell
   Atlantic had repaired or replaced approximately 60% of the deployed network
   elements requiring remediation, and certification testing/evaluation is well
   underway.  Bell Atlantic also has made substantial progress on the remaining
   network elements.  Although Bell Atlantic is generally on track to achieve
   its June 30, 1999 goal for network elements, it is possible that the
   timeframe for compliance of a small number of network elements may extend
   into July or August, without any impact on customer service or its
   operations.

 .  Application and Support Systems

   Bell Atlantic has approximately 1,200 applications and systems that support:
   (i) the administration and maintenance of its network and customer service
   functions (network information systems); (ii) customer care and billing
   functions; and (iii) human resources, finance and general corporate
   functions.  Bell Atlantic originally assessed approximately 48% of these
   application systems as either compliant or to be retired.  As of March 31,
   1999, Bell Atlantic has successfully completed certification
   testing/evaluation of approximately 73% of all application systems.  Bell
   Atlantic also has made substantial progress on the remaining application
   systems.  Although Bell Atlantic is generally on track to achieve its June
   30, 1999 goal for applications and support systems, it is possible that the
   timeframe for compliance of a small number of applications and support
   systems may extend into July or August, without any impact on customer
   service or its operations.

 .  Information Technology Infrastructure

   Approximately 40 mainframe, 1,000 mid-range, and 90,000 personal computers,
   related network components and software products comprise Bell Atlantic's
   information technology (IT) infrastructure.  Of the approximately 1,350
   unique types of elements in the inventory for the IT infrastructure, Bell
   Atlantic originally assessed approximately 73% as compliant or to be retired.
   As of March 31, 1999, Bell Atlantic has successfully completed certification
   testing/evaluation of approximately 95% of all mission critical element
   types.  Bell Atlantic has made substantial progress on the remaining items
   and is on track to achieve its June 30, 1999 goal.

                                       13
<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

   Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 program also includes a project to review and
remediate affected systems (including those with embedded technology) within its
buildings and other facilities, a project to assure Year 2000 compliance across
all of its internal business processes, and other specific projects directed
towards insuring it meets its Year 2000 objectives.

   Third Party Issues

   .   Vendors

       In general, Bell Atlantic's product vendors have made available either
       Year 2000-compliant versions of their offerings or new compliant products
       as replacements of discontinued offerings. In some cases, the compliance
       "status" of the product in question is based on vendor-provided
       information, which remains subject to Bell Atlantic testing and
       verification activities. In several instances, vendors have not met
       original delivery schedules, resulting in delayed testing and deployment.
       At this time, Bell Atlantic does not anticipate that such delays will
       have a material impact on its ability to achieve Year 2000 compliance
       within its desired timeframes.

       Bell Atlantic is continuing Year 2000-related discussions with utilities
       and similar services providers. In general, information requests to such
       services providers have yielded less meaningful information than
       inquiries to its product vendors, and Bell Atlantic does not yet have
       sufficient information to determine whether key utilities and similar
       service providers will successfully complete the Year 2000 transition.
       However, Bell Atlantic is now beginning to engage in more productive
       discussions with large utilities servicing its facilities and it is
       hopeful that these discussions will provide additional assurance of Year
       2000 compliance for those entities. At the present time, Bell Atlantic
       remains unable to determine the Year 2000 readiness of most key utilities
       and similar service providers or the likelihood that those providers will
       successfully complete the Year 2000 transition. Bell Atlantic intends to
       monitor critical service provider activities, as appropriate, through the
       completion of their respective remediation projects.

   .   Customers

       Bell Atlantic's customers remain keenly interested in the progress of its
       Year 2000 efforts, and it anticipates increased demand for information,
       including detailed testing data and company-specific responses. Bell
       Atlantic is providing limited warranties of Year 2000 compliance for
       certain new telecommunications services and other offerings, but it does
       not expect any resulting warranty costs to be material.

   .   Interconnecting Carriers

       Bell Atlantic's network operations interconnect with domestic and
       international networks of other carriers. If one of these interconnecting
       carriers should fail or suffer adverse impact from a Year 2000 problem,
       Bell Atlantic's customers could experience impairment of service.

Costs

   From the inception of Bell Atlantic's Year 2000 project through March 31,
1999, and based on the cost tracking methods it has historically applied to this
project, Bell Atlantic has incurred total pre-tax expenses of approximately $138
million, and it has made capital expenditures of approximately $89 million.  For
1999, Bell Atlantic expects to incur total pre-tax expenses for its Year 2000
project of approximately $75 million to $150 million (approximately $16 million
of which was incurred through March 31, 1999) and total capital expenditures of
$75 million to $125 million (approximately $9 million of which was incurred
through March 31, 1999).

   Bell Atlantic has investments in various joint ventures and other interests.
At this time, Bell Atlantic does not anticipate that the impact of any Year 2000
remediation costs that they incur will be material to its results of operations.

Risks

   The failure to correct a material Year 2000 problem could cause an
interruption or failure of certain of Bell Atlantic's normal business functions
or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of
operations, liquidity or financial condition; however, it considers such a
likelihood remote.  Due to the uncertainty inherent in other Year 2000 issues
that are ultimately beyond Bell Atlantic's control, including, for example, the
final Year 2000 readiness of its suppliers, customers, interconnecting carriers,
and joint venture and investment interests, it is unable to determine at this
time the likelihood of a material impact on its results of operations, liquidity
or financial condition, due to such Year 2000 issues. However, Bell Atlantic is
taking appropriate prudent measures to mitigate that risk.  Bell Atlantic
anticipates that, in the event 

                                       14
<PAGE>
 
                       Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc.

of any material interruptions or failures of its service resulting from actual
or perceived Year 2000 problems within or beyond our control, it could be
subject to third party claims.

Contingency Plans

   As a public telecommunications carrier, Bell Atlantic has had considerable
experience successfully dealing with natural disasters and other events
requiring contingency planning and execution.  As part of Bell Atlantic's
efforts to develop appropriate Year 2000 contingency plans, it is reviewing its
existing Emergency Preparedness and Disaster Recovery plans for any necessary
modifications.

   Bell Atlantic has developed, where appropriate, contingency plans for
addressing delays in remediation activities.  For example, delay in the
installation of a new Year 2000 compliant system could require remediation of
the existing system.  It is also developing a corporate Year 2000 contingency
plan to ensure that core business functions and key support processes are in
place for uninterrupted processing and service, in the event of external (e.g.
power, public transportation, water), internal or supply chain failures (i.e.
critical dependencies on another entity for information, data or services).
Bell Atlantic has prepared an initial draft of its corporate Year 2000
contingency plan and it is continuing to refine and enhance that plan.
