                    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  (Unaudited)

1. Basis of Presentation

    Verizon New Jersey Inc., formerly Bell Atlantic - New Jersey, Inc., is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic Corporation (d/b/a Verizon
Communications). The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have
been prepared based upon Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules that
permit reduced disclosure for interim periods. These financial statements
include certain reclassifications in presentation as a result of the merger of
Bell Atlantic Corporation (Bell Atlantic) and GTE Corporation (GTE) (see Note
2). These financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a
fair presentation of results of operations and financial position for the
interim periods shown including normal recurring accruals and other items (see
Note 2). The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
results for the full year.  For a more complete discussion of significant
accounting policies and certain other information, you should refer to the
financial statements included in our 1999 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2. Bell Atlantic - GTE Merger

    On June 30, 2000, Bell Atlantic and GTE completed a merger of equals under a
definitive merger agreement dated as of July 27, 1998.  Under the terms of the
agreement, GTE became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic.  With the
closing of the merger, the combined company began doing business as Verizon
Communications.  The merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests.

Merger-Related and Severance Costs

    Results of operations for June 30, 2000 included merger-related pre-tax
costs totaling approximately $41.1 million consisting of $18.9 million for
direct incremental costs, $19.8 million for employee severance costs and $2.4
million for transition costs. These costs include approximately $33.8 million
representing our allocated share of merger-related costs from Verizon Services
Corp. (Verizon Services), an affiliate that provides centralized services on a
contract basis. Costs allocated from Verizon Services are included in Operations
and Support - Other Operating Expenses.

    Direct incremental costs consist of our proportionate share of expenses
associated with completing the merger transaction such as professional and
regulatory fees, compensation arrangements and shareowner-related costs.
Employee severance costs, as recorded under SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits," represent our proportionate share of benefit costs
for the separation of management employees who are entitled to benefits under
pre-existing Verizon Communications separation pay plans.  The separations are
expected to occur as a result of consolidations and process enhancements.
Accrued postemployment benefit liabilities for those employees are included in
our balance sheet as a component of Employee Benefit Obligations.  Transition
costs consist of our proportionate share of costs associated with integrating
the operations of Bell Atlantic and GTE.  Transition costs are expensed as
incurred.

3. Dividend

    On August 1, 2000, we declared and paid a dividend in the amount of $134.6
million to Verizon Communications.

4. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Accounting Standards - Derivatives and Hedging Activities

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This statement requires that
all derivatives be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet.  Changes in the fair values of derivative
instruments will be recognized in either earnings or comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use and effectiveness of the instruments.  The FASB
amended this pronouncement in June 1999 to defer the effective date of SFAS No.
133 for one year.  We must adopt SFAS No. 133 no later than January 1, 2001.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                            Verizon New Jersey Inc.

    In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," which amended SFAS No.
133.  The amendments in SFAS No. 138 address certain implementation issues and
relate to such matters as the normal purchases and normal sales exception, the
definition of interest rate risk, hedging recognized foreign-currency-
denominated assets and liabilities, and intercompany derivatives.  SFAS No. 138
also amends SFAS No. 133 for decisions made by the FASB relating to the
Derivatives Implementation Group process.

    We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138.
The impact of adoption will be determined by several factors, including the
specific hedging instruments in place and their relationships to hedged items,
as well as market conditions at the date of adoption.

FASB Interpretation - Stock Compensation

    In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation." Interpretation No. 44 was
issued in order to clarify certain issues arising from Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," which was
previously issued in October 1972. Interpretation No. 44 is effective July 1,
2000, but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur either after
December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000.

    The main issues addressed by Interpretation No. 44 are: (a) the definition
of an employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 25, (b) the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the
accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination.

    Interpretation No. 44 will not have a material impact on our results of
operations or financial position.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin - Revenue Recognition

    In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101,
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," which must be adopted by the
fourth quarter of 2000.  SAB No. 101 provides additional guidance on revenue
recognition, as well as criteria for when revenue is generally realized and
earned, and also requires the deferral of incremental direct selling costs.  We
are currently assessing the impact of SAB No. 101 on our results of operations
and financial position.

</TABLE>

      Net income and comprehensive income were the same for the six months ended
June 30, 2000 and 1999.

6.    Commitments and Contingencies

    Various legal actions and regulatory proceedings are pending to which we are
a party.  We have established reserves for specific liabilities in connection
with regulatory and legal matters that we currently deem to be probable and
estimable.  We do not expect that the ultimate resolution of pending regulatory
and legal matters in future periods will have a material effect on our financial
condition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations.

    Federal and state regulatory conditions to the merger include certain
commitments to, among other things, promote competition and the widespread
deployment of advanced services, while helping ensure that consumers continue to
receive high-quality, low cost telephone services. In some cases, there are
significant penalties associated with not meeting these commitments. The cost of
satisfying these commitments could have a significant impact on net income in
future periods. Over the remainder of 2000, based on preliminary estimates, the
cost of satisfying these commitments is likely to impact the net income of
Verizon Communications on a consolidated basis by approximately $275 to $325
million. The estimated impact on each operating telephone subsidiary is still
being assessed.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
        (Abbreviated pursuant to General Instruction H(2).)

    This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements
and Notes to Financial Statements.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------

    We reported net income of $333.8 million for the six month period ended June
30, 2000, compared to net income of $301.7 million for the same period in 1999.

    Our results for 2000 and 1999 were affected by special items.  The special
items in both periods include our allocated share of charges from Verizon
Services Corp. (Verizon Services).

    The following table shows how special items are reflected in our condensed
statements of income for each period:

   What follows is a further explanation of the nature of these special items.

Bell Atlantic - GTE Merger

   On June 30, 2000, Bell Atlantic and GTE completed a merger of equals under a
definitive merger agreement dated as of July 27, 1998.  Under the terms of the
agreement, GTE became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic.  With the
closing of the merger, the combined company began doing business as Verizon
Communications.  The merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests.

Merger-Related and Severance Costs

   Results of operations for June 30, 2000 included merger-related pre-tax costs
totaling approximately $41.1 million consisting of $18.9 million for direct
incremental costs, $19.8 million for employee severance costs and $2.4 million
for transition costs. These costs include approximately $33.8 million
representing our allocated share of merger-related costs from Verizon Services,
an affiliate that provides centralized services on a contract basis.  Costs
allocated from Verizon Services are included in Operations and Support - Other
Operating Expenses.

   Direct incremental costs consist of our proportionate share of expenses
associated with completing the merger transaction such as professional and
regulatory fees, compensation arrangements and shareowner-related costs.
Employee severance costs, as recorded under SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits," represent our proportionate share of benefit costs
for the separation of management employees who are entitled to benefits under
pre-existing Verizon Communications separation pay plans.  The separations are
expected to occur as a result of consolidations and process enhancements.

costs consist of our proportionate share of costs associated with integrating
the operations of Bell Atlantic and GTE. Transition costs are expensed as
incurred.

Regulatory Contingency

    In the second quarter of 2000, we recognized a charge for a regulatory
matter totaling $.7 million. We recorded a reduction to operating revenue in the
amount of $.5 million and a charge to interest expense of $.2 million. This
matter relates to a specific issue currently under investigation by federal
regulatory commissions. We believe that it is probable that the ultimate
resolution of this matter will result in refunds to our customers, including
interest.

Other Charges and Special Items

    In the second quarter of 2000, we recorded other charges and special items
totaling approximately $13.5 million in connection with consolidating operations
and combining organizations and for other nonrecurring items arising in the
quarter. These charges included costs for write-offs of accounts receivable and
duplicate assets, legal contingencies and other miscellaneous items.

Bell Atlantic - NYNEX Merger

Merger-Related Costs

    In connection with the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger, which was completed in
August 1997, we recorded pre-tax merger-related transition costs of $4.9 million
in the first six months of 1999.

    Transition costs consisted of our proportionate share of costs associated
with integrating the operations of Bell Atlantic and NYNEX, such as systems
modifications costs and advertising and branding costs.  Transition costs were
expensed as incurred.

    These and other items affecting the comparison of our results of operations
for the six month periods ended June 30, 2000 and 1999 are discussed in the
following sections.

LOCAL SERVICES

      2000 - 1999                                              Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Six months                                          $45.6         5.3%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Local service revenues are earned from the provision of local exchange,
local private line, wire maintenance, voice messaging and value-added services.
Value-added services are a family of services that expand the utilization of the
network, including products such as Caller ID, Call Waiting and Return Call.
Local services also includes wholesale revenues from unbundled network element
(UNE) platforms, certain data transport revenues, and wireless interconnection
revenues.

    Local service revenues increased in the first six months of 2000 primarily
due to higher customer demand and usage of our value-added services, as well as
our national directory assistance and data transport and digital services. Local
service revenue growth in the first six months of 2000 also reflects higher
usage of our network facilities. Revenue growth was generated, in part, by an
increase in access lines in service of 4.0% from June 30, 1999.


NETWORK ACCESS SERVICES

      2000 - 1999                                              Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Six months                                          $46.7         7.4%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Network access revenues are earned from end-user subscribers and from long
distance and other competing carriers who use our local exchange facilities to
provide services to their customers.  Switched access revenues are derived from
fixed and usage-based charges paid by carriers for access to our local network.
Special access revenues originate from carriers and end-users that buy dedicated
local exchange capacity to support their private networks.  End-user access
revenues are earned from our customers and from resellers who purchase dial-tone
services.

    Network access revenue growth in the first six months of 2000 was mainly
attributable to higher customer demand, as reflected by growth in access minutes
of use of 5.6% from the same period in 1999.  Volume growth also reflects a
continuing expansion of the business market, particularly for high capacity data
services.  In the first six months of 2000, demand for special access services
increased, reflecting a greater utilization of our network.  Higher network
usage by alternative providers of intraLATA toll services and higher end-user
revenues attributable to an increase in access lines in service further
contributed to revenue growth this year.

    In addition, network access revenues included higher revenues received from
customers for the recovery of local number portability (LNP) costs.  LNP allows
customers to change local exchange carriers while maintaining their existing
telephone numbers.  In December 1998, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) issued an order permitting us to recover costs incurred for LNP in the
form of monthly end-user charges for a five-year period beginning in March 1999.

    Revenue growth was partially offset by price reductions associated with a
federal price cap filing and other regulatory decisions.  The FCC regulates the
rates that we charge long distance carriers and end-user subscribers for
interstate access services. We are required to file new access rates with the
FCC each year.  In July 1999, we implemented interstate price decreases of
approximately $4 million on an annual basis in connection with the FCC's Price
Cap Plan. The rates included in our July 1999 filing were in effect through June
2000.  Interstate price decreases were $14 million on an annual basis for the
period July 1998 through June 1999.  The rates include amounts necessary to
recover our contribution to the FCC's universal service fund which are subject
to adjustment every quarter due to potential increases or decreases in our
contribution to the fund.  Our contributions to the universal service fund are
included in Other Operating Expenses.  As a result of a U.S. Court of Appeals
decision last year, our contributions to the universal service fund were reduced
by approximately $13 million annually beginning November 1, 1999, and our
interstate access rates were reduced accordingly because we will no longer have
to recover these contributions in our rates. In addition, revenue was reduced by
a special charge of $.5 million for a contingency associated with a regulatory
matter, as described in the Results of Operations section.

LONG DISTANCE SERVICES

      2000 - 1999                                              (Decrease)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Six months                                          $(2.1)        .8%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Long distance revenues are earned primarily from calls made to points
outside a customer's local calling area, but within our service area (intraLATA
toll). IntraLATA toll calls originate and terminate within the same LATA, but
generally cover a greater distance than a local call. These services are
regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) except where they
cross state lines. Other long distance services that we provide include 800
services, Wide Area Telephone Service (WATS), and corridor services (between
LATAs in southern New Jersey and Philadelphia and between LATAs in northern New
Jersey and New York City).

    The decline in long distance revenues in the first six months of 2000 was
principally caused by the competitive effects of presubscription, which enables
customers to make intraLATA toll calls using a competing carrier without having
to dial an access code. The negative effect of presubscription on long distance
revenues was partially mitigated by increased network access services for usage
of our network by alternative service providers. In response to presubscription,
we have implemented customer win-back and retention initiatives that include
toll calling discount packages and product bundling offers. The decline in long
distance revenue was substantially offset by higher calling volumes and price
increases implemented on certain toll services.

ANCILLARY SERVICES

      2000 - 1999                                              Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Six months                                          $17.0         14.8%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Our ancillary services include such services as billing and collections for
long distance carriers and affiliates, facilities rentals to affiliates and
nonaffiliates, collocation for competitive local exchange carriers, usage of
separately priced (unbundled) components of our network by competitive local
exchange carriers, public (coin) telephone, customer premises equipment (CPE)
and sales of materials and supplies to affiliates. Ancillary services revenues
also include fees paid by customers for nonpublication of telephone numbers and
multiple white page listings and fees paid by an affiliate for usage of our
directory listings.

    Ancillary services revenues increased in the first six months of 2000
primarily as a result of higher payments received from competitive local
exchange carriers for interconnection of their networks with our network and for
the purchase of unbundled network elements.  Revenue growth was also
attributable to higher facilities rental revenues received from affiliates.
These increases were partially offset by lower revenues from our billing and
collection services, lower revenues from our pay phone services due to the
increasing popularity of wireless communications, and lower fees paid to us by
an affiliate for usage of our directory listings.

EMPLOYEE COSTS

      2000 - 1999                                              Increase
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Six months                                          $4.4          1.3%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Employee costs consist of salaries, wages and other employee compensation,
employee benefits and payroll taxes paid directly by us.  Similar costs incurred
by employees of Verizon Services, who provide centralized services on a contract
basis, are allocated to us and are included in Other Operating Expenses.

    Employee costs increased in the first six months of 2000 primarily as a
result of annual salary and wage increases for management and associate
employees, higher overtime payments and higher work force levels. Employee costs
were further impacted by merger-related costs recorded in the second quarter of
2000.  As described in the Results of Operations section, we recognized
approximately $6.9 million in benefit costs for the separation of employees who
are entitled to benefits under pre-existing Verizon Communications separation
pay plans. We also recorded approximately $.4 million for direct incremental
merger-related costs associated with compensation arrangements. Merger-related
costs associated with Verizon Services were allocated to us and are included in
Other Operating Expenses. An increase in repair and maintenance activity also
contributed to the increase, but to a lesser extent.

    These increases were substantially offset by lower pension and benefit
costs. The decline in pension and benefit costs was due to favorable pension
plan investment returns and changes in actuarial assumptions. These factors were
partially offset by changes in certain plan provisions, including a previously
reported amendment to our management cash balance plan and a special lump sum
pension payment to management and associate retirees.

    Associate employees wages, pension and other benefits are determined under
contracts with unions representing our associate employees. On August 6, 2000,
collective bargaining agreements with unions representing our employees expired,
and the unions initiated a work stoppage. As of 8:00 a.m. on August 14, 2000, we
continued to negotiate new agreements with the unions.

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

      2000 - 1999                                              Increase

      Six months                                          $22.0         3.8%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other operating expenses consist of contract services including centralized
services expenses allocated from Verizon Services, rent, network software costs,
operating taxes other than income, the provision for uncollectible accounts
receivable, and other costs.

    The increase in other operating expenses was largely attributable to the
effect of merger-related costs and other special items recorded in the second
quarter of 2000. These charges totaled $47.3 million and were comprised of our
allocated share of $12.9 million for employee severance, $18.5 million for
direct incremental and $2.4 million for transition merger-related costs incurred
by Verizon Services, and $13.5 million for other miscellaneous expense items.
Other miscellaneous expense items included $5.3 million for the write-off of
accounts receivable, $5.3 million for the write-off of duplicate assets, $2.5
million for legal contingencies and $.4 million for other items.  Higher
interconnection and related costs associated with reciprocal compensation
arrangements with competitive local exchange and other carriers to terminate
calls on their networks also contributed to the increase in other operating
expenses, but to a lesser extent.

    These increases were partially offset by a reduction in centralized services
expenses allocated from Verizon Services, primarily as a result of lower
employee costs incurred by Verizon Services and lower property taxes.


DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

      2000 - 1999                                              Increase

      Six months                                          $30.0         8.0%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the first six months of
2000 over the same period in 1999 principally as a result of growth in
depreciable telephone plant and changes in the mix of plant assets.  The growth
in telephone plant was largely attributable to increased capital expenditures
for software and hardware to support the expansion of our network.  These
factors were partially offset by the effect of lower rates of depreciation and
amortization.


OTHER INCOME, NET

      2000 - 1999                                              Increase

      Six months                                          $9.5          --%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The change in other income, net, was primarily attributable to additional
interest income associated with the settlement of a tax-related matter in the
first six months of 2000.  Other items contributing to the change, but to a
lesser extent, were an increase of $1.2 million in the income recognized from
our investment in SMS/800 under the equity method and nonperformance fees
received from a vendor.

      Six months                                          $4.0          7.4%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Interest expense includes costs associated with borrowings and capital
leases, net of interest capitalized as a cost of acquiring or constructing plant
assets.

    Interest expense increased in the first six months of 2000 over the same
period in 1999 primarily due to higher levels of average short-term debt with an
affiliate and higher interest rates associated with this debt.  Interest expense
was also impacted by additional interest costs of $.2 million associated with a
regulatory contingency, as described in the Results of Operations section.
These factors were partially offset by higher capitalized interest costs
resulting from higher levels of average telephone plant under construction.


EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The effective income tax rate is the provision for income taxes as a
percentage of income before the provision for income taxes. Our effective income
tax rate was higher in the six months of 2000 principally due to non-recurring
income tax benefits recorded in the first six months of 1999.


OTHER MATTERS
- -------------

FCC Regulation and Interstate Rates

    On May 31, 2000, the FCC approved the industry proposal to restructure
access charges (known as the "CALLS plan"). Under the terms of the plan, direct
end-user access charges are increased while access charges to long distance
carriers are reduced. While the plan continues the 6.5% (less inflation) annual
reductions for most interstate access charges, it provides for a price freeze
when switched access transport prices reach $0.0055 per-minute. In addition, in
conjunction with provisions that will allow carriers to deaverage their
subscriber line charges by geographic zones, the plan establishes a new $650
million universal service fund to support interstate access rates. Of that
amount, Verizon Communications expects approximately $320 million to be used to
support interstate access services in its service territory. The price
restructuring portions of the plan are mandatory for all large local exchange
carriers, including Verizon Communications' telephone operating companies, such
as us. The price level portions of the plan are mandatory only in the initial
year of the plan. Carriers have until September 14, 2000 to decide whether to
participate in the remaining four years of the plan, or whether to submit cost
studies as the basis of future price caps.

    Consistent with the new access plan, Verizon Communications filed tariff
adjustments to take effect on July 1, 2000 (with modifications effective August
11, 2000).  As a result of these tariff adjustments, former GTE carriers in ten
states, and former Bell Atlantic carriers in seven states reached the $0.0055
benchmark and, should Verizon Communications opt into the full five year CALLS
plan, they will not be subject to further annual interstate switched access
price reductions for the remaining life of the plan.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

FASB Accounting Standards - Derivatives and Hedging Activities

    In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities."  This statement requires that
all derivatives be measured at fair value and recognized as either assets or
liabilities on our balance sheet.  Changes in the fair values of derivative
instruments will be recognized in either earnings or comprehensive income,
depending on the designated use and effectiveness of the instruments.  The FASB
amended this pronouncement in June 1999 to defer the effective date of SFAS No.
133 for one year.  We must adopt SFAS No. 133 no later than January 1, 2001.

    In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain
Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities," which amended SFAS No.
133.  The amendments in SFAS No. 138 address certain implementation issues and
relate to such matters as the normal purchases and normal sales exception, the
definition of interest rate risk, hedging recognized foreign-currency-
denominated assets and liabilities, and intercompany derivatives.  SFAS No. 138
also amend SFAS No. 133 for decisions made by the FASB relating to the
Derivatives Implementation Group process.

    We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 138.
The impact of adoption will be determined by several factors, including the
specific hedging instruments in place and their relationships to hedged items,
as well as market conditions at the date of adoption.

FASB Interpretation - Stock Compensation

    In March 2000, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 44, "Accounting for
Certain Transactions involving Stock Compensation." Interpretation No. 44 was
issued in order to clarify certain issues arising from Accounting Principles
Board (APB) Opinion No. 25 "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," which was
previously issued in October 1972. Interpretation No. 44 is effective July 1,
2000, but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur either after
December 15, 1998 or January 12, 2000.

    The main issues addressed by Interpretation No. 44 are: (a) the definition
of an employee for purposes of applying APB Opinion No. 25, (b) the criteria for
determining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, (c) the
accounting consequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously
fixed stock option or award, and (d) the accounting for an exchange of stock
compensation awards in a business combination.

    Interpretation No. 44 will not have a material impact on our results of
operations or financial position.

SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin - Revenue Recognition

    In December 1999, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101,
"Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements," which must be adopted by the
fourth quarter of 2000.  SAB No. 101 provides additional guidance on revenue
recognition, as well as criteria for when revenue is generally realized and
earned, and also requires the deferral of incremental direct selling costs.  We
are currently assessing the impact of SAB No. 101 on our results of operations
and financial position.
