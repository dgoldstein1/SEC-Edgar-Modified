Item 5. Other Events.

                On August 14, 1997, Bell Atlantic Corporation ("Bell Atlantic"),
a Delaware corporation, and NYNEX Corporation ("NYNEX"), a Delaware corporation,
consummated a merger (the "Merger") whereby Bell Atlantic Merger Venture, Inc.
("Merger Sub"), a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bell
Atlantic, was merged with and into NYNEX pursuant to an Amended and Restated
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 21, 1996, as amended and
restated on July 2, 1996, by and between NYNEX and Bell Atlantic and to which
Merger Sub also became a party. As a result of the Merger, NYNEX has become a
wholly owned subsidiary of Bell Atlantic.

                 
                Prior to the Merger, the assets of NYNEX, through NYNEX's 
subsidiaries (including, principally, New York Telephone Company and New England
Telephone and Telegraph Company), were used to provide a broad range of
telecommunications and telecommunications-related services. Bell Atlantic
intends to continue such uses for the assets of NYNEX.
