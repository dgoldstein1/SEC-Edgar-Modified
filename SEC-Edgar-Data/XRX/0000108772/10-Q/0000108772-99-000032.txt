Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time Xerox Corporation (the Registrant or the Company) and its
representatives may provide information, whether orally or in writing,
including certain statements in this Form 10-Q under "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition," which are
deemed to be "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("Litigation Reform Act").  These forward-
looking statements and other information relating to the Company are based on
the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information
currently available to management.

The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," and
similar expressions, as they relate to the Company or the Company's
management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Such
statements reflect the current views of the Registrant with respect to future
events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially
from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.
The Registrant does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.

In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act we are making
investors aware that such "forward-looking" statements, because they relate to
future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
the forward-looking statements.  Such factors include but are not limited to
the following:

Competition - the Registrant operates in an environment of significant
competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of
customers to become more efficient.  There are a number of companies worldwide
with significant financial resources which compete with the Registrant to
provide document processing products and services in each of the markets
served by the Registrant, some of whom operate on a global basis.  The
Registrant's success in its future performance is largely dependent upon its
ability to compete successfully in its currently-served  markets and to expand
into additional market segments.

Transition to Digital - presently black and white light-lens copiers represent
approximately 31 percent of the Registrant's revenues.  This segment of the
general office is mature with anticipated declining industry revenues as the
market transitions to digital technology.  Some of the Registrant's new
digital products replace or compete with the Registrant's current light-lens
equipment.  Changes in the mix of products from light-lens to digital, and the
pace of that change as well as competitive developments could cause actual
results to vary from those expected.

Pricing - the Registrant's ability to succeed is dependent upon its ability to
obtain adequate pricing for its products and services which provide a
reasonable return to shareholders.  Depending on competitive market factors,
future prices the Registrant can obtain for its products and services may vary
from historical levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset devaluations
may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the
face of customer resistance and/or competition.

Financing Business - a significant portion of the Registrant's profits arise
from the financing of its customers' purchase of the Registrant's equipment.
On average, 75 to 80 percent of equipment sales are financed through the
Registrant.  The Registrant's ability to provide such financing at competitive
rates and realize profitable spreads is highly dependent upon its own costs of
borrowing which, in turn, depend upon its credit ratings.  Significant changes
in such ratings could reduce the profitability of such financing business
and/or make the Registrant's financing less attractive to customers thus
reducing the volume of financing business done.  The Registrant's present
credit ratings permit ready access to the credit markets.  There is no
assurance that these credit ratings can be maintained and/or ready access to
the credit markets can be assured.

Productivity - the Registrant's ability to sustain and improve its profit
margins is largely dependent on its ability to maintain an efficient, cost-
effective operation.  Productivity improvements through process reengineering,
design efficiency and supplier cost improvements are required to offset labor
cost inflation and potential materials cost changes and competitive price
pressures.

International Operations - the Registrant derives approximately half its
revenue from operations outside of the United States.  In addition, the
Registrant manufactures many of its products and/or their components outside
the United States.  The Registrant's future revenue, cost and profit results
could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, changes in economic conditions from country
to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection
measures, licensing requirements and local tax issues.

New Products/Research and Development - the process of developing new high
technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain.  It
requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging
technological trends.  The Registrant must then make long-term investments and
commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will
eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate
the revenues required to provide anticipated returns from these investments.

Revenue Growth - Registrant's ability to attain a consistent trend of revenue
growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon
expansion of its equipment sales worldwide.  The ability to achieve equipment
sales growth is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to
provide industry-oriented global solutions for major customers and expansion
of its distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing
pressures.  Our inability to attain a consistent trend of revenue growth could
materially affect the trend of our actual results.

Restructuring - the Registrant's ability to ultimately reduce pre-tax annual
expenditures by approximately $1 billion is dependent upon its ability to
successfully implement the 1998 restructuring program including the
elimination of 9,000 jobs, net, worldwide, the closing and consolidation of
facilities, and the successful implementation of process and systems changes.

Year 2000 - the Registrant's ability to complete its Year 2000 plan is
dependent upon the availability of resources, the Registrant's ability to
discover and correct the potential Year 2000 sensitive problems which could
have a serious impact on the Registrant's information management systems,
facilities and products, and the ability of the Registrant's suppliers and
customers to bring their systems into Year 2000 compliance.

presented herein have been prepared by Xerox Corporation ("the
Company") in accordance with the accounting policies described in
its 1998 Annual Report to Shareholders and should be read in
conjunction with the notes thereto.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair
statement of operating results for the interim periods presented
have been made.

Certain historical amounts have been restated to reflect
reclassifications to conform to the current presentation.  The
impact of these changes is not material and did not affect net
income.

3.  On January 25, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a two-
for-one split of the Company's common stock. The effective date
of the stock split was February 23 for shareholders of record as
of February 4. Shareholders' equity has been restated to give
retroactive recognition to the stock split in prior periods by
reclassifying from additional paid-in capital to common stock the
par value of the additional shares arising from the split. In
addition, all references in the financial statements to number of
shares and per-share amounts have been restated.

4.  On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring
program associated with enhancing our competitive position and
lowering our overall cost structure. In connection with this
program, in the second quarter of 1998 we recorded a pre-tax
provision of $1,644 million ($1,107 million after taxes and
including our $18 million share of a restructuring charge
recorded by Fuji Xerox).  The program includes the elimination of
approximately 9,000 jobs, net, worldwide, the closing and
consolidation of facilities, and the write-down of certain
assets.  The charges associated with this restructuring program
include $113 million of inventory charges recorded as cost of
revenues and $316 million of asset impairments.  Included in the
asset impairment charge are facility fixed assets write-downs of
$156 million and other asset write-downs of $160 million.  For
facility fixed assets classified as assets to be disposed of, the
impairment loss recognized is based on fair value less cost to
sell, with fair value based on third-party valuations as well as
our internal estimates of existing market prices for similar
assets.  The effect of suspending depreciation on assets no
longer in use for the second quarter of 1999 is not material.
The remaining $160 million of asset impairments includes the
write-down of certain technology assets and other items impacted
by the consolidation activities.

The headcount reductions are occurring primarily in
administrative functions, but also impact service, research and
manufacturing.

The following table summarizes the status of the restructuring
reserve (in millions):

As of June 30 1999, approximately 8,200 employees have left the
Company under the restructuring program.

There have been no material changes to the program since its
announcement in April 1998, and the majority of the remaining
reserve will be utilized throughout the remainder of 1999 and
2000.

8.  Securitization of Receivables

In the second quarter of 1999, Xerox Credit Corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary, securitized approximately $750 million of
finance receivables.  The gain from this transaction was not
material.


9.  Litigation

Continuing Operations

On March 10, 1994, a lawsuit was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Kansas by two independent
service organizations (ISOs) in Kansas City and St. Louis and
their parent company. Subsequently, a single corporate entity,
CSU, L.L.C.("CSU") was substituted for the three affiliated
companies. CSU claimed damages predominately resulting from the
Company's alleged refusal to sell parts for high volume copiers
and printers to CSU prior to 1994. The Company's policies and
practices with respect to the sale of parts to ISOs were at issue
in an antitrust class action in Texas, which was settled by the
Company during 1994. Claims for individual lost profits of ISOs
who were not named parties, such as CSU, were not included in
that class action.  The Company asserted counterclaims against
CSU alleging patent and copyright infringement relating to the
copying of diagnostic software and service manuals.  On April 8,
1997, the District Court granted partial summary judgment in
favor of the Company on CSU's antitrust claims, ruling that the
Company's unilateral refusal to sell or license its patented
parts cannot give rise to antitrust liability.  On January 8,
1999,  the Court dismissed with prejudice  all of CSU's
antitrust claims.  CSU has preserved for appeal only its claims
that Xerox  unlawfully  refused to sell  critical parts
(including patented parts), to sell manuals  and to license
patented and copyrighted  software and its claim that   the
Company's  refusal to sell non-critical parts was unlawful
because it was in conjunction with an allegedly unlawful refusal
to sell critical parts.  The District Court also granted summary
judgment in favor of the Company on its patent infringement
claim, leaving open with respect to patent infringement only the
issues of willfulness and the amount of damages, and granted
partial summary judgment in favor of the Company with respect to
some of its claims of copyright infringement.   A judgment  in
the amount of  $1,039,282 was entered  in favor of  the Company
and against CSU on the  copyright infringement counterclaim.
CSU has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit.

   On April 11, 1996, an action was commenced by Accuscan Corp.
(Accuscan), in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, against the Company seeking unspecified
damages for infringement of a patent of Accuscan which expired in
1993. The suit, as amended, was directed to facsimile and certain
other products containing scanning functions and sought damages
for sales between 1990 and 1993. On April 1, 1998, the jury
entered a verdict in favor of Accuscan for $40 million.  However,
on September 14, 1998, the Court granted the Company's motion for
a new trial on damages.  The Company is also seeking to appeal
the issue of liability and believes that the liability verdict
should be set aside.  A new trial on damages is set for August,
1999.

   On December 18, 1998, three former employees of Crum & Forster
Holdings, Inc. (a former subsidiary of ours) ("C&F") filed a
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of
New Jersey claiming wrongful termination of their participation
in the Xerox Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP").
Xerox, the ESOP, C&F and the company that acquired C&F are named
defendants.  Plaintiffs purport to bring this action on behalf of
themselves and a class of approximately 10,000 persons who were
employed by C&F (or one of its insurance subsidiaries which also
participated in the ESOP) from July 1, 1989 through December 31,
1993.  Plaintiffs assert violations of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act, breach of contract, conversion, unjust
enrichment and fraudulent misrepresentation.  They are seeking
approximately $250 million in damages.

   The foregoing action is related to an action previously filed
in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Texas. The Texas plaintiffs did not specify their damages, but
they sought certification of a similar class of former ESOP
participants. Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was
denied by the Court on March 26, 1999.  The plaintiffs have asked
the Court to reconsider its decision.

   On May 26, 1999, the District Court of New Jersey granted
Xerox' motion to transfer the New Jersey case to the Western
District of Texas, where it has been consolidated with the
previously filed action.

   We deny any wrongdoing and we intend to vigorously defend the
consolidated action.

   On June 24, 1999 Xerox Corporation was served with a summons
and complaint filed in the Superior Court of the State of
California for the County of Los Angeles.  The complaint was
filed on behalf of 681 individual plaintiffs claiming damages as
a result of Xerox' alleged disposal and/or release of hazardous
substances into the soil, air and groundwater. On July 22, 1999 a
complaint was filed in the same Court, which has not yet been
served on Xerox, in a separate action on behalf of an additional
80 plaintiffs with the same claims for damages as the earlier
action. Plaintiffs in both cases further allege that they have
been exposed to such hazardous substances by inhalation,
ingestion and dermal contact, including but  not limited to,
hazardous substances contained within the municipal drinking
water supplied by the City of Pomona and the Southern California
Water Company.  Plaintiffs' claims against Xerox include personal
injury, wrongful death, property damage, negligence, trespass,
nuisance, fraudulent concealment, absolute liability for ultra-
hazardous activities, civil conspiracy, battery, and violation of
California Unfair Trade Practices Act.  Damages are unspecified.

   We deny any liability for the plaintiffs' alleged damages and
intend to vigorously defend these actions.


10.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities.  SFAS No. 133 requires companies to recognize all
derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at their fair
value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of
those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of
the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. We
do not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. In July 1999, the FASB issued
SFAS 137 which defers the effective date of SFAS 133 until the
start of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  We will
adopt SFAS 133 beginning January 1, 2001.



Item 2                   Xerox Corporation
             Management's Discussion and Analysis of
           Results of Operations and Financial Condition

                         Document Processing

Summary

Income increased 13 percent to $448 million in the 1999 second
quarter from $395 million in the 1998 second quarter, before the
1998 worldwide restructuring program charge of $1,107 million.  The
increase reflects improved revenue growth, particularly in the
United States and Europe, and ongoing benefits from the company's
worldwide restructuring program and the continuing focus on
productivity and expense controls.

Pre-currency revenues, excluding Brazil, grew 7 percent, reflecting
revenue growth of 9 percent in the United States and 6 percent in
Europe. Including Brazil where revenues declined substantially due
to the January currency devaluation and economic weakness, pre-
currency revenues grew 4 percent. Total 1999 second quarter
revenues, including the effect of adverse European currency
translation, grew 3 percent to $4.9 billion compared with $4.7
billion in the 1998 second quarter.  Revenues in the 1999 first
half were $9.2 billion compared with $9.0 billion a year ago.


Diluted earnings per share increased 15 percent to $0.62 in the
1999 second quarter from $0.54 in the 1998 second quarter, before
the 1998 restructuring charge.

For the first six months of the year, diluted earnings per share
from continuing operations, before the 1998 restructuring charge,
increased 14 percent to $1.09 and income from continuing operations
increased 13 percent to $791 million.


Pre-Currency Growth

To understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is
helpful to adjust revenue and expense growth (except for ratios) to
exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign
currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to this adjusted growth as
pre-currency growth. Latin American currencies are shown at
actual exchange rates for both pre-currency and post-currency
reporting, since these countries generally have volatile currency
and inflationary environments, and our operations in these
countries traditionally implement pricing actions to recover the
impact of inflation and devaluation.

A substantial portion of our consolidated revenues is derived from
operations outside of the United States where the U.S. dollar is
not the functional currency. When compared with the average of the
major European currencies on a revenue-weighted basis, the U.S.
dollar was approximately 3 percent stronger in the 1999 second
quarter than in the 1998 second quarter.  As a result, European
currency translation had an unfavorable impact of one percentage
point on revenue growth in both the second quarter and first half
of 1999.

The unfavorable impact of our Brazilian operation on our total
revenue growth was approximately 3 percentage points. This included
the continued impact of the very significant January currency
devaluation and a weaker economic environment.  The average Real
exchange rate declined 33 percent to 1.71 in the 1999 second
quarter from 1.15 in the 1998 second quarter.

Revenues denominated in currencies where the local currency is the
functional currency, including the Brazilian Real, are not hedged
for purposes of translation into U.S. dollars.

Revenues

Total pre-currency revenues grew 4 percent in the 1999 second
quarter and grew 7 percent excluding Brazil. For the major product
categories, the pre-currency revenue growth rates are as follows:

                                                       1999
                            1998                        (Excluding
                    Q1   Q2   Q3   Q4   FY     Q1   Q2     Brazil)
                                                         Q1   Q2

Total Revenues      10%  10%   6%   7%   8%    (1)%  4%   3%   7%

Digital product revenues grew 26 percent in the 1999 second quarter
and reached 52 percent of revenues compared with 42 percent of
total revenues in the 1998 second quarter.  This growth was driven
by the continued outstanding revenue growth from our expanding
family of black-and-white Document Centre digital multi-function
products, particularly the 55 and 65 page-per-minute products.
Production publishing revenues grew 8 percent in the 1999 second
quarter and production printing revenues grew 5 percent.  Color
copying and printing revenue growth improved to 11 percent in the
1999 second quarter, compared with 8 percent in the 1999 first
quarter, reflecting initial placements of the DocuColor 30 and
DocuColor 100 product lines and excellent growth in DocuColor 40
and indirect channels color laser revenues. Office color copier
revenues declined as unit volumes declined, and pricing pressure
and some shift to less-featured models was partially offset by
growth in recurring revenues. Our DocuPrint N series of monochrome
laser printers and new and expanding line of monochrome digital
copiers sold through indirect sales channels continued their
excellent growth.  For the 1999 first half, digital product
revenues grew 27 percent, driven by outstanding growth from the
Document Centre digital copier family, the DocuPrint N series and
digital copiers sold through indirect sales channels as well as 10
percent growth in production publishing revenues and 10 percent
growth in color copying and printing revenues.  Black-and-white
light-lens copier revenues declined 20 percent in the 1999 second
quarter and 22 percent in the 1999 first half as a result of the
weakness in Brazil, increased pricing pressures and customer
transition to digital copiers.

Geographically, the pre-currency revenue growth rates are as
follows:


                                 1998                   1999

Memo: Fuji Xerox        2   (4)   (6)   (4)  (3)      (1)   (3)

U.S. revenue growth in the 1999 second quarter was driven by a
rebound in equipment sales through both direct and indirect
channels, as well as continued excellent growth in document
outsourcing.  U.S. revenue growth in the 1999 first half of 6
percent was driven by strong growth in equipment sales through both
direct and indirect channels, as well as continued excellent growth
in document outsourcing.

European revenue growth rebounded to 6 percent in the 1999 second
quarter, reflecting strong equipment sales growth and outstanding
document outsourcing growth. Spain, Italy and Eastern Europe had
strong revenue growth in the 1999 second quarter, France and the
U.K. had good growth, while revenues declined in Germany and
Holland.  European revenue growth of 4 percent in the 1999 first
half reflected good equipment sales growth and outstanding document
outsourcing growth.

Other Areas include operations principally in Latin America,
Canada, China, Russia, India, the Middle East and Africa.  Revenue
in Brazil declined by 32 percent in the 1999 second quarter and 38
percent in the 1999 first half reflecting primarily the very
significant currency devaluation as well as the Brazilian
recession.  Brazilian revenues represented approximately 6 percent
of Xerox revenues in the 1999 second quarter compared with 9
percent in the 1998 second quarter.  Excluding Brazil, revenue
growth in Other Areas was modest, including strong growth in Mexico
and flat revenues in Canada.

Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., an unconsolidated entity jointly owned by
Xerox Limited and Fuji Photo Film Company Limited, develops,
manufactures and distributes document processing products in Japan,
Australia, New Zealand, and other areas of the Pacific Rim.  Fuji
Xerox revenue declined by 3 percent in the 1999 second quarter and
2 percent in the 1999 first half reflecting a modest revenue
decline in Japan partially offset by modest revenue growth in Fuji
Xerox' other Asia Pacific territories.

The pre-currency growth rates by type of revenue are as follows:
                                                        1999
                              1998                       (Excluding
                      Q1   Q2   Q3   Q4   FY    Q1   Q2     Brazil)

Memo:
Document Outsourcing* 29   39   36   44   38    31   34   34   35

*Includes equipment accounted for as equipment sales.

Equipment sales, which grew 2 percent in the 1999 second quarter
and were flat for the 1999 first half, were impacted significantly
by the currency devaluation and recession in Brazil. Excluding
Brazil, equipment sales grew 12 percent in the second quarter and 8
percent in the first half as U.S. and European sales productivity
and indirect channels equipment sales rebounded. Approximately 50
percent of 1999 second quarter equipment sales was derived from
products introduced since 1997, including the company's expanding
line of black-and-white Document Centre digital multi-function
equipment, the DocuColor 30, the DocuColor 70, the DocuColor 100,
the DocuTech 65, 96 and 180 page-per-minute Production Publishers,
and the expanding monochrome and color laser and inkjet product
families sold through indirect channels.

Recurring revenues, including revenues from service, document
outsourcing, rentals, supplies, paper and finance income, represent
the revenue stream that follows equipment placement. Growth in
these revenues is primarily a function of the growth in our
installed population of equipment, usage levels, pricing and
interest rates.  The recurring revenue growth of 4 percent in the
1999 second quarter and 1999 first half is consistent with the
trend throughout 1998, reflecting continued excellent growth in
Document Outsourcing as customers focus on their core business and
outsource their document processing requirements to Xerox, and the
favorable revenue impact of higher machine populations resulting
from higher equipment sales last year.  This was partially offset
by some diversion from service, rentals, supplies, paper and
finance income to document outsourcing as well as competitive price
pressures.

Key Ratios and Expenses

The trend in key ratios was as follows:

                                1998                    1999
                     Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    FY       Q1    Q2

Gross Margin       44.9% 45.6% 46.3% 48.0% 46.3%    45.9% 45.3%
SAG % Revenue      27.8  27.3  27.7  26.8  27.3     27.2  25.8

The gross margin declined by 0.3 percentage points in the 1999
second quarter from the 1998 second quarter before the 1998
restructuring charge as continuing competitive price pressures and
changing business mix due primarily to higher revenue growth in
both the document outsourcing and the indirect channels businesses
were partially offset by manufacturing and other productivity
improvements.  The gross margin increased 0.3 percentage points in
the 1999 first half from the 1998 first half before the 1998
restructuring charge as manufacturing and other productivity
improvements were partially offset by continuing competitive price
pressures and changing business mix due primarily to higher revenue
growth in both the document outsourcing and the indirect channels
businesses.

Selling, administrative and general expenses (SAG) declined 2
percent in the 1999 second quarter from the 1998 second quarter and
2 percent in the 1999 first half from the 1998 first half driven by
a substantial decline in general and administrative expenses
reflecting the benefits of our 1998 restructuring program, our
continued focus on productivity and expense controls to mitigate
the impact of the economic turmoil in Brazil, and significant cost
reductions in Brazil as well as the beneficial currency translation
impact of the devaluation of the Brazilian currency.  In the 1999
second quarter and 1999 first half, SAG represented 25.8 percent
and 26.5 percent of revenue, an improvement of 1.5 and 1.1
percentage points, respectively from the corresponding 1998
periods.

Research and development (R&D) expense in the 1999 second quarter
declined 2 percent from the 1998 second quarter, as increased R&D
product program spending was more than offset by lower overhead
expenses.  R&D expense for the first half of 1999 increased 2
percent.  We continue to invest in technological development to
maintain our premier position in the rapidly changing document
processing market with an added focus on increasing the
effectiveness of that investment and time to market. Xerox R&D is
strategically coordinated with that of Fuji Xerox which invested
$636 million in R&D in the 1998 full year, for a combined total of
$1.7 billion.

Worldwide employment declined by 300 in the 1999 second quarter to
92,500 as a result of 1,800 employees leaving the company under the
worldwide restructuring program, partially offset by the net hiring
of 1,500 employees for the company's fast-growing document
outsourcing business, direct sales representatives, staffing for
the centralized European customer care and shared services
operations in Ireland and research and development skills
enhancement.

The small decreases in other expenses, net, from the 1998 second
quarter and 1998 first half were primarily due to planned lower
year 2000 remediation spending and several small one-time gains
which were essentially offset by increased non-financing interest
expense. The increased non-financing interest expense was the
result of higher debt balances partially offset by lower interest
rates.

Income Taxes (Benefits), Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated
Affiliates and Minorities' Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries

Income before income taxes increased 16 percent to $633 million in
the 1999 second quarter from $545 million in the 1998 second
quarter before the 1998 worldwide restructuring program charge.

The effective tax rate was 31.0 percent in the 1999 second quarter,
which is consistent with the 1999 first quarter and the full year
expectation.

Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates is principally
our 50 percent share of Fuji Xerox income. Excluding our $18
million share of a 1998 second quarter Fuji Xerox restructuring
charge, total equity in net income decreased in the 1999 second
quarter and the 1999 first half. Difficult economic conditions in
Japan and other Asia Pacific countries impacted Fuji Xerox income
again in the 1999 second quarter. We expect the difficult economic
conditions in Japan and the Pacific Rim to continue to adversely
affect Fuji Xerox' operations and it is unlikely that their
earnings, before currency translation, will contribute to Xerox
earnings growth in 1999.

On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring program
associated with enhancing our competitive position and lowering our
overall cost structure. In connection with this program, we
recorded a second quarter 1998 pre-tax provision of $1,644 million
($1,107 million after taxes and including our $18 million share of
a restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox).  The program
includes employment reductions, the closing and consolidation of
facilities, and the write-down of certain assets.

As of June 30, 1999, approximately 8,200 employees had left the
company under the restructuring program. The reserve balance of
$662 million at June 30, 1999 relates to cash expenditures to be
incurred primarily during the remainder of 1999 and 2000.

The Year 2000 (Y2K) problem is the result of computer programs
written in two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable
year. As a result, many information systems are unable to properly
recognize and process date-sensitive information beyond December
31, 1999. As with all major companies, certain of our information
systems and products require remediation or replacement in order to
render these systems Year 2000 compliant. Though a majority of our
remediation and replacement work has been completed, 1999 will be
used to finish any remaining mission-critical areas and develop and
deploy business contingency plans.

   We have divided the Year 2000 project into five major sections:
Information Technology; and the non-Information Technology areas of
Facilities, Vendor Compliance, Product Compliance and Facilities
Management products and services. The general phases common to all
sections are: 1) Awareness - a strategic approach was developed to
address the Year 2000 problem. 2) Assessment - detailed plans and
target dates were developed. 3) Programming - includes hardware and
software upgrades, systems replacements, vendor certification and
other associated changes. 4) Testing - includes testing and
conversion of system applications. 5) Implementation - includes
compliance achievement and user acceptance.

   The Information Technology section includes applications
(software), compute (mainframe/smaller computer environments),
infrastructure (networks, servers, and workstations), and
telecommunications. The status of each section as of June 30, 1999
is as follows:

   Applications - 99 percent of the mission-critical applications
are Y2K Compliant and tested. The remaining work is planned for
completion by the third quarter of 1999.

   Compute - 94 percent of our mainframe/smaller computer
environments have been upgraded to be Y2K compliant with the
remainder scheduled to be completed by September 1999.

   Infrastructure - 96 percent of networks, servers, and
workstations have been upgraded to be Y2K compliant with the
remainder to be completed by the third quarter of 1999.

   Telecommunications - 79 percent of internal mission-critical
components requiring upgrades are Y2K compliant with the remainder
planned for compliance by October 1999. We continue to assess
external public utility provider readiness and pursue status on
those providers who do not respond.

   The Facilities section, which includes building electrical
systems, elevators, access control, security systems, etc., is
primarily in the remediation phase. We are on track for achieving
compliance of critical owned sites by October 31, 1999.  Leased
sites are on track and planned for compliance by December 31, 1999.

   We began our efforts in the Vendor Compliance area in 1997.  A
general awareness letter was sent to all external suppliers, and an
assessment survey was sent to all business critical suppliers.
Follow-up was then initiated to validate survey responses and
provide a risk profile for each supplier.

   To date, 93 percent of mission critical suppliers have been
assessed.  New suppliers have been added to the list and
assessments are underway.  Of the suppliers assessed, 87 percent
are rated high confidence as of July 1999.  We will continue to
work with the 13 percent of suppliers rated low confidence to
ensure supply continuity through 2000.  Assessments for the
remaining 7 percent of mission critical suppliers should be
completed by August 1999.

   	The Y2K vendor compliance process as it relates to our
manufacturing operations has primarily focused on our first tier
suppliers, and concerns about the adequacy of a single strategy
approach.  In response to these concerns, we will to the extent
necessary, build an inventory hedge on selected key products and
critical sole source parts.  This inventory coupled with our normal
inventory levels will provide us with a resolution window to
resolve any Y2K issues.  We expect the additional inventory to be
less than the $100 million originally anticipated.  In summary, we
believe the resolution period incorporated in the Y2K vendor
strategy is adequate to provide supplier continuity coverage.  This
procedure is intended to provide a means of managing risk; however,
no assurance can be given that it will eliminate the potential
disruption caused by third party failure.

   	Our 1999 efforts include on-site inspection of 20 key suppliers
to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 1999 and
contingency planning.

   Regarding Product Compliance, 99 percent of our products,
excluding end-of-life products, are Y2K compliant, or we have
developed a software/hardware patch or have another solution
available.  We  are implementing these Y2K solutions  for all in-
field Xerox products worldwide, with expected completion during the
third quarter of 1999.

   In Facilities Management, we have completed inventory,
compliance assessment, and action plans.  Remediation activities
are underway for all customers; 97 percent of required remediation
of third party components has been accomplished. Completion of
remediation, on-site integrated testing of components and full
deployment is planned for the third quarter of 1999.  Remediation
of Xerox products at these sites is being coordinated with the
product compliance area.

   Contingency Planning--Certain of our processes have in place
business resumption plans. In addition, we have established a
contingency program which requires our critical business process
managers to develop alternative plans should our, or third party
remediation efforts experience unforeseen difficulty.

   We are also dependent upon our customers for sales and cash
flows. Y2K interruptions in our customers' operations could result
in reduced sales, increased inventory or receivable levels and cash
flow reductions. While these events are possible, our customer base
is sufficiently broad to minimize those risks.

   In 1993, Xerox began a project to replace the majority of its
legacy systems, which in many cases date back to the 1960s. These
efforts continue today.  As to remediation, we currently estimate
that costs, exclusive of software and systems that are being
replaced or upgraded in the normal course of business, and
including our products and facilities, as well as legacy systems,
will be $183 million, of which $28 million was spent in 1997, $92
million in 1998 and $30 million in the first half of 1999.  We
estimate $33 million will be spent in the remainder of 1999.

   We believe that the remediation of our information systems and
products will occur in a timely fashion so that the Y2K problem
will not result in significant operating problems with our
operating systems, facilities and products. However, if such
remediations are not completed in a timely manner or if third party
suppliers of products or services have not completed their
remediation efforts, the Y2K problem could potentially have a
material adverse impact on our operations. Possible worst case
consequences could include an interruption in our ability to: bill
and apply collections from our customers; manufacture and deliver
products to our customers; or meet our cash requirement needs.




New Accounting Standards.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities.  SFAS No. 133 requires companies to
recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at
their fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in the
values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on the
use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting. We do not expect this Statement to have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements. In July 1999, the
FASB issued SFAS 137 which defers the effective date of SFAS 133
until the start of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.  We
will adopt SFAS 133 beginning January 1, 2001.



Discontinued Operations - Insurance and Other Financial Services

The net investment in the discontinued financial services
businesses which includes Insurance, Other Financial Services and
Third Party Financing and Real Estate totaled $753 million at June
30, 1999 compared with $759 million at December 31, 1998.  The
change in 1999 was primarily caused by the funding of reinsurance
coverage for the former Talegen Holdings, Inc. (Talegen) companies
to Ridge Reinsurance Limited (Ridge Re) and interest for the period
on the assigned debt, both of which were more than offset by the
sale of six of our remaining eight financing leases, the sale of
other Real Estate investments and other run-off activity.  A
discussion of the discontinued businesses follows.

Status of Insurance

In 1995, we recorded a $1,546 million after tax charge in
connection with the disengagement activities for our five then
remaining Talegen insurance companies and three related service
companies.

In 1997 and 1998, all of the insurance companies and service
companies were sold.  As part of the consideration for one of the
companies, The Resolution Group, Inc. (TRG), which closed in the
fourth quarter of 1997, we received a $462 million performance-
based instrument.  We will participate in the future cash flows of
TRG via the performance-based instrument.  The recovery of this
instrument is dependent upon the sufficiency of TRG's available
cash flows.  Based on current forecasts at June 30, 1999, we expect
to realize $462 million for this instrument.  However, the ultimate
realization may be greater or less than this amount.

Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI) continues to provide
aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage to certain of the
former Talegen units and TRG through Ridge Re, a wholly owned
subsidiary. The coverage limits remaining at June 30, 1999 total
$620 million, which is net of 15 percent coinsurance and exclusive
of $234 million in coverage which was reinsured under a
retrocessional arrangement during the fourth quarter of 1998 for a
total cost to Ridge Re of $158 million.  At June 30, 1999, Ridge Re
had recognized the discounted value of approximately $327 million
of the available coverage and it is possible that some additional
reserves could ultimately be needed, although this is not currently
anticipated. In April 1999, Ridge Re entered into a novation
agreement with another insurer to eliminate its obligations for the
reinsurance coverage for Westchester Specialty Group (WSG), a
former Talegen unit.  The coverage limit under WSG's policy was
$128 million.  In connection with the agreement, Ridge Re paid the
insurer $95 million.

XFSI has guaranteed to certain of the former Talegen units and TRG
that Ridge Re will meet all of its financial obligations under the
Reinsurance Agreements.  Related premium payments to Ridge Re are
made by XFSI and guaranteed by us. As of June 30, 1999, there were
three remaining annual premium installments of $38 million, plus
finance charges. We have also guaranteed that Ridge Re will meet
its financial obligations on $578 million of the Reinsurance
Agreements and have provided a $400 million partial guaranty of
Ridge Re's $600 million letter of credit facility.  This facility
is required to provide security with respect to aggregate excess of
loss reinsurance obligations under contracts with certain of the
former Talegen units and TRG.

XFSI may also be required, under certain circumstances, to purchase
over time additional redeemable preferred shares of Ridge Re, up to
a maximum of $301 million.

Net Investment in Insurance

The net investment in Insurance at June 30, 1999 totaled $602
million compared with a balance of $513 million at December 31,
1998.  The increase in 1999 is due to contractual payments to Ridge
Re for annual premium installments and associated finance charges,
an anticipated settlement payment related to the sale of one of the
former Talegen units and interest on the assigned insurance debt.


Other Financial Services

The net investment in Other Financial Services at June 30, 1999 was
$138 million compared with $132 million at December 31, 1998. Debt
associated with these assets totaled $50 million at June 30, 1999
and December 31, 1998.  The increase in the investment is primarily
due to interest on the assigned debt and settlement of litigation,
partially offset by the disposition of other investments.



Third Party Financing and Real Estate

Third Party Financing and Real Estate assets at June 30, 1999 and
December 31, 1998 totaled $101 million and $250 million,
respectively.  The reduction primarily relates to the sale of six
of our remaining eight financing leases as well as other asset
sales and runoff activity that were consistent with the amounts
contemplated in the formal disposal plan.  Debt associated with
these assets totaled $38 million and $86 million at June 30, 1999
and December 31, 1998, respectively.




                  Capital Resources and Liquidity

Total debt, including ESOP and Discontinued Operations debt not
shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets, increased to
$15,513 million at June 30, 1999 or $406 million more than at
December 31, 1998. The changes in consolidated indebtedness during
the first six months of 1999 and 1998 are summarized as follows (in
millions):

*  Before restructuring charge
** Includes rental equipment depreciation of $216 million and $200
million in six months ended June 30, 1999 and 1998, respectively

Non-financing operations' cash usage during the first six months of
1999 totaled $889 million or $10 million less than in the first six
months of 1998.   The positive effects of higher net income and
non-cash charges and improved inventory turnover were largely
offset by capital spending related to our pan European initiatives,
net changes in other assets and liabilities such as prepaid
expenses, accounts payable and accrued compensation, and higher
payments related to the 1998 restructuring reserve.


Financing Businesses

Customer financing-related debt declined by $1,050 million and
increased by $220 million during the first six months of 1999 and
1998, respectively.   This significant period-over-period reduction
reflects: i. an allocation to non financing operations, based on
our 8:1 debt to equity guideline, of a portion of Xerox do Brasil's
U.S. dollar denominated debt used to fund local currency
denominated customer finance receivables and, ii. The
securitization in second quarter 1999 of $750 million of Xerox
Credit Corporation financing contracts.

Debt related to discontinued third party financing and real estate
activities, which is included in financing business debt, totaled
$38 million at June 30, 1999 or $52 million less than at year end
1998.  Asset sales and portfolio run-off account for the year to
date reduction.  Third party financing and real estate debt was
$108 at June 30, 1998 or $11 million less than at year-end 1997.


Risk Management

Xerox is typical of multinational corporations in that it is
exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and interest rates that could affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

We have entered into certain financial instruments to manage
interest rate and foreign currency exposures. These instruments are
held solely for hedging purposes and include interest rate swap
agreements, forward exchange contracts and foreign currency swap
agreements. We do not enter into derivative instrument transactions
for trading purposes and employ long-standing policies prescribing
that derivative instruments are only to be used to achieve a set of
very limited objectives.

Currency derivatives are primarily arranged in conjunction with
underlying transactions that give rise to foreign currency-
denominated payables and receivables. For example, an option to buy
foreign currency to settle the importation of goods from foreign
suppliers, or a forward exchange contract to fix the dollar value
of a foreign currency-denominated loan.

With regard to interest rate hedging, virtually all customer-
financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. Therefore, we "lock
in" an interest rate spread by arranging fixed-rate liabilities
with similar maturities as the underlying assets, and fund the
assets with liabilities in the same currency, except in developing
economies where capital market access to these financial
instruments is impracticable.  We refer to the effect of these
conservative practices as "match funding" customer financing
assets. This practice effectively eliminates the risk of a major
decline in interest margins during a period of rising interest
rates. Conversely, this practice effectively eliminates the
opportunity to materially increase margins when interest rates are
declining.

Pay fixed-rate and receive variable-rate swaps are typically used
in place of more expensive fixed-rate debt. Additionally, pay
variable-rate and receive fixed-rate swaps are used from time to
time to transform longer-term fixed-rate debt into variable rate
obligations. The transactions performed within each of these
categories enable more cost-effective management of interest rate
exposures. The potential risk attendant to this strategy is the
non-performance of the swap counterparty. We address this risk by
arranging swaps with a diverse group of strong-credit
counterparties, regularly monitoring their credit ratings and
determining the replacement cost, if any, of existing transactions.

Our currency and interest rate hedging are typically unaffected by
changes in market conditions as forward contracts, options and
swaps are normally held to maturity consistent with our objective
to lock in currency rates and interest rate spreads on the
underlying transactions.

    dividends of subsidiaries, by total fixed charges.  Fixed charges consist
    of interest, including capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends
    of subsidiaries, and one-third of rent expense as representative of the
    interest portion of rentals.  Debt has been assigned to discontinued
    operations based on historical levels assigned to the businesses when
    they were continuing operations, adjusted for subsequent paydowns.
    Discontinued operations consist of the Company's Insurance, Other
    Financial Services, and Third Party Financing and Real Estate businesses.

(2) The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
    the Company's finance subsidiaries, which primarily finance Xerox
    equipment.  Financing businesses are more highly leveraged and,
    therefore, tend to operate at lower earnings to fixed charges ratio
    levels than do non-financing businesses.

*   Earnings for the six months of 1998 were inadequate to cover fixed charges.
    The coverage deficiency was $676 million.  Excluding the restructuring
    charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would have been 3.25 and 3.55
    for the six months ended June 30, 1998 and the year ended December 31, 1998,
    respectively.

    Interests and Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates.
