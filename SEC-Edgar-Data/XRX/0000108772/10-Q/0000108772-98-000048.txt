Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time Xerox Corporation (the Registrant or the Company) and its 
representatives may provide information, whether orally or in writing, 
including certain statements in this Form 10-Q under "Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ," which are 
deemed to be "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("Litigation Reform Act").  These forward-
looking statements and other information relating to the Company are based on 
the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information 
currently available to management.

The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," and 
similar expressions, as they relate to the Company or the Company's 
management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Such 
statements reflect the current views of the Registrant with respect to future 
events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should 
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially 
from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.  
The Registrant does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.

In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act we are making 
investors aware that such "forward-looking" statements, because they relate to 
future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors 
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in 
the "forward-looking" statements.  Such factors include but are not limited to 
the following:

Competition - the Registrant operates in an environment of significant 
competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of 
customers to become more efficient.  There are a number of companies worldwide 
with significant financial resources which compete with the Registrant to 
provide document processing products and services in each of the markets 
served by the Registrant, some of whom operate on a global basis.  The 
Registrant's success in its future performance is largely dependent upon its 
ability to compete successfully in its currently-served  markets and to expand 
into additional market segments.  

Transition to Digital - presently black and white light-lens copiers represent 
approximately 40% of the Registrant's revenues.  This segment of the general 
office is mature with anticipated declining industry revenues as the market 
transitions to digital technology.  Some of the Registrant's new digital 
products replace or compete with the Registrant's current light-lens 
equipment.  Changes in the mix of products from light-lens to digital, and the 
pace of that change as well as competitive developments could cause actual 
results to vary from those expected.

Pricing - the Registrant's ability to succeed is dependent upon its ability to 
obtain adequate pricing for its products and services which provide a 
reasonable return to shareholders.  Depending on competitive market factors, 
future prices the Registrant can obtain for its products and services may vary 
from historical levels.

Financing Business - a significant portion of the Registrant's profits arise 
from the financing of its customers' purchase of the Registrant's equipment.  
On average, 75 to 80 percent of equipment sales are financed through the 
Registrant.  The Registrant's ability to provide such financing at competitive 
rates and realize profitable spreads is highly dependent upon its own costs of 
borrowing which, in turn, depend upon its credit ratings.  Significant changes 
in such ratings could reduce the profitability of such financing business 
and/or make the Registrant's financing less attractive to customers thus 
reducing the volume of financing business done.  The Registrant's present 
credit ratings permit ready access to the credit markets.  There is no 
assurance that these credit ratings can be maintained and/or ready access to 
the credit markets can be assured.

Productivity - the Registrant's ability to sustain and improve its profit 
margins is largely dependent on its ability to maintain an efficient, cost-
effective operation.  Productivity improvements through process reengineering, 
design efficiency and supplier cost improvements are required to offset labor 
and materials cost inflation and competitive price pressures.

International Operations - the Registrant derives approximately half its 
revenue from operations outside of the United States.  In addition, the 
Registrant manufactures many of its products and/or their components outside 
the United States.  The Registrant's future revenue, cost and profit results 
could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates, changes in economic conditions from country 
to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection 
measures, licensing requirements and local tax issues.

New Products/Research and Development - the process of developing new high 
technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain.  It 
requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging 
technological trends.  The Registrant must then make long-term investments and 
commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will 
eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and revenues 
required to provide anticipated returns from these investments.

Restructuring - the Registrant's ability to ultimately reduce pre-tax annual 
expenditures by approximately $1 billion is dependent upon its ability to 
successfully implement the 1998 restructuring program including the 
elimination of 9,000 jobs worldwide, the closing and consolidation of 
facilities, and the successful implementation of process and systems changes.

Year 2000 - the Registrant's ability to complete its Year 2000 plan is 
dependent upon the availability of resources, the Registrant's ability to 
discover and correct the potential Year 2000 sensitive problems which could 
have a serious impact on the Registrant's information management systems, 
facilities and products, and the ability of the Registrant's suppliers and 
customers to bring their systems into Year 2000 compliance.

1.  The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements 
presented herein have been prepared by Xerox Corporation ("the 
Company") in accordance with the accounting policies described in 
its 1997 Annual Report to Shareholders and should be read in 
conjunction with the notes thereto.

Effective 1998, Fuji Xerox changed its reporting period from a 
fiscal year ending December 20 to a fiscal year ending December 
31.  Our share of their results of operations during the period 
between the end of the 1997 fiscal year and the beginning of the 
new fiscal year (the stub period) amounted to a loss of $6 
million.  The loss was debited to retained earnings.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of 
normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair 
statement of operating results for the interim periods presented 
have been made.

References herein to "we" or "our" refer to Xerox and 
consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically 
requires otherwise.

2.  Inventories consist of (in millions):

				     September 30,     December 31,
					     1998             1997

3.  On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring 
program associated with enhancing our competitive position and 
lowering our overall cost structure. In connection with this 
program, we recorded a second-quarter, pretax provision of $1,644 
million ($1,107 million after taxes and including our share, $18 
million, of a restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox).  The 
program will include the elimination of approximately 9,000 jobs 
worldwide, the closing and consolidation of facilities, and the 
write-down of certain assets to net realizable value.  The 
charges associated with this action include $113 million of 
inventory charges recorded as cost of revenues.  Key initiatives 
of the restructuring will include:
1) Consolidating 56 European customer support centers into one
   facility and implementing a shared services organization which
   will generate order entry, invoicing, and other back-office
   and sales operations.
2) Streamlining manufacturing, logistics, distribution and
   service operations.  This will include centralizing U.S. parts
   depots  and outsourcing storage and distribution.
3) Overhauling our internal processes and associated resources,
   including closing one of four geographically-organized U.S.
   customer administrative centers.
 
 The reductions will occur primarily in administrative functions, 
but will also impact service, research and manufacturing.
 
 The following table summarizes the status of the restructuring 
reserve (in millions):

 As of September 30, 1998, approximately 3,200 employees have left 
the Company under the restructuring program.
 
 4.  In May 1998, we acquired XLConnect Solutions, Inc. 
("XLConnect"), an information technology services company, and 
its parent Company, Intelligent Electronics, Inc. ("Intelligent 
Electronics") for $413 million in cash.  The operating results of 
these companies, which are immaterial, have been included in our 
consolidated statement of income from the date of acquisition.  
Based on the allocation of the purchase price, this transaction 
resulted in goodwill of $395 million (including transaction 
costs), which is being amortized over 25 years.
 
 5.  Common shareholders' equity consists of (in millions):

 Effective January 1, 1998, we adopted Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standards No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income."  
This Statement requires that companies disclose comprehensive 
income, which includes net income, foreign currency translation 
adjustments, minimum pension liability adjustments, and 
unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities classified 
as available-for-sale.
 
 Comprehensive income is as follows (in millions):

 6. In April 1998, we issued convertible subordinated debentures 
for net proceeds of $575 million.  The proceeds were used to 
reduce commercial paper.  The amount due upon maturity in April 
2018 is $1,012 million, resulting in an effective interest rate 
of 3.625% per annum, including 1.003% payable in cash 
semiannually beginning in October 1998.  These debentures are 
convertible at any time at the option of the holder into 3.904 
shares of our stock per $1,000 principal amount at maturity of 
debentures.
 
 7.  Interest expense totaled $553 million and $450 million for 
the nine months ended September 30, 1998 and 1997, respectively.  
 
 8.  On August 13, 1998, we closed on the previously announced sale 
of Crum & Forster Holdings, Inc. (CFI) to Fairfax Financial 
Holdings Limited of Toronto for $680 million, including the 
repayment of $115 million in debt.  We incurred approximately $75 
million in transaction-related costs.
 
 With the completion of the CFI transaction, we have effectively 
completed our exit from insurance and financial services.  An 
additional write-down of $190 million after-tax was recorded in 
the first quarter of 1998.
 
9.  Litigation 
     
Continuing Operations

On March 10, 1994, a lawsuit was filed in the United States 
District Court for the District of Kansas by two independent 
service organizations (ISOs) in Kansas City and St. Louis and 
their parent company.  Subsequently, a single corporate entity, 
CSU,L.L.C.("CSU") was substituted for the three affiliated 
companies. CSU claims damages predominately resulting from the 
Company's alleged refusal to sell parts for high volume copiers 
and printers to CSU prior to 1994. The Company's policies and 
practices with respect to the sale of parts to ISOs were at issue 
in an antitrust class action in Texas, which was settled by the 
Company during 1994. Claims for individual lost profits of ISOs 
who were not named parties, such as CSU, were not included in 
that class action.  The Company has asserted counterclaims 
against CSU alleging patent and copyright infringement  relating 
to the copying of diagnostic software and service manuals.  On 
April 8, 1997, the District Court granted partial summary 
judgement in favor of the Company on CSU's  antitrust claims, 
ruling that the Company's unilateral refusal to sell or license 
its patented parts cannot give rise to antitrust liability.  The 
Court's ruling did not preclude a finding of antitrust liability 
based upon other allegations of exclusionary conduct, including 
the refusal to sell unpatented parts.  The District Court also 
granted summary judgement in favor of the Company on its patent 
infringement claim, leaving open with respect to patent 
infringement only the issues of willfulness and the amount of 
damages, and granted partial summary judgement in favor of the 
Company with respect to some of its claims of copyright 
infringement.  On July 17, 1997 and December 22, 1997 the Court 
denied CSU's motions for reconsideration. On  June 16-17, 1998 a 
trial was held to establish copyright infringement damages to be 
awarded to Xerox for the unlawful copying of the Company's 
diagnostic software. A settlement was reached with regard to the 
Company's infringement  claims relating to service manuals.  The 
Court has calculated damages due to the Company in the amount of 
$1,039,282 for its diagnostic software copyright infringement 
claims.  The Company intends to move for summary judgement on 
plaintiff's antitrust claims.  In response to that motion 
Plaintiff has indicated it will concede, in light of the Court's 
prior rulings, that there are no issues of fact barring entry of 
summary judgement on its antitrust claims in favor of the Company 
but that it will argue for reversal on appeal.

 On April 11, 1996, an action was commenced by Accuscan Corp. 
(Accuscan), in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York, against the Company seeking unspecified 
damages for infringement of a patent of Accuscan which expired in 
1993.  The suit, as amended, was directed to facsimile and 
certain other products containing scanning functions and sought 
damages for sales between 1990 and 1993.  On April 1, 1998, the 
jury entered a  verdict in favor of Accuscan for $40,000,000.  On 
October 1, 1998, the court entered an order which gives plaintiff 
the option of reducing the amount of damages to $8,000,000 or, in 
the alternative, request a new trial on the issue of damages.  
Separately, the Company has filed a notice of appeal to the Court 
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit with respect to the issue of 
whether the Company should be liable for any damages.  The 
Company believes that the liability verdict should be set aside.

 Item 2                   Xerox Corporation
	      Management's Discussion and Analysis of
	    Results of Operations and Financial Condition

		      Document Processing
Summary

Income from continuing operations increased 19 percent to $381 
million in the 1998 third quarter from $320 million in the 1997 
third quarter, primarily as a result of outstanding growth in 
digital product revenues and improved operating profit margins, 
including the initial benefits from the worldwide restructuring 
program.

Third quarter 1998 revenues of $4.6 billion were affected by 
weaker global economic conditions, growing 6 percent on a pre-
currency basis.   Weakness in Brazil and Russia alone reduced pre-
currency revenue growth by 2 percentage points in the quarter. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 18 
percent to $1.05 in the third quarter.

For the first nine months of the year, excluding the restructuring 
charge, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 
increased 16 percent to $2.98 and income from continuing 
operations increased 16 percent to $1,078 million.  Including the 
restructuring charge and the loss from discontinued operations, 
Xerox reported a net loss of $219 million for the first nine 
months of 1998, or a net loss of $0.77 per share.

Pre-Currency Growth

To understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is 
helpful to adjust revenue and expense growth (except for ratios) 
to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign 
currencies into U.S. dollars.  We refer to this adjusted growth as 
"pre-currency growth."

A substantial portion of our consolidated revenues is derived from 
operations outside of the United States where the U.S. dollar is 
not the functional currency. When compared with the average of the 
major European currencies on a revenue-weighted basis, the U.S. 
dollar was approximately 2 percent weaker in the 1998 third 
quarter than in the 1997 third quarter. However, the 9 percent 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared with the Canadian dollar 
essentially offset this impact. 

Revenues denominated in currencies where the local currency is the 
functional currency are not hedged for purposes of translation 
into U.S. dollars.

Revenues

For the major product categories, the pre-currency revenue growth 
rates are as follows:
 
				  1997                    1998    _
			 Q1   Q2   Q3   Q4   FY      Q1   Q2    Q3

 Light Lens Copiers     (2)  (3)   1    (2)  (2)     (4)  (8) (15)
 
Digital product revenues grew 38 percent in the 1998 third 
quarter, reaching 47 percent of total revenues and again exceeding 
light lens revenues. In the 1997 third quarter, digital revenues 
represented 35 percent of total revenues. The outstanding growth 
of our expanding Document Centre black and white digital copier 
family revenues represented 25 percentage points of the year-over-
year digital revenue growth. Production printing grew 11 percent 
in the 1998 third quarter and production publishing grew 12 
percent following a strong 1997 third quarter.   Color copying and 
printing growth slowed to 8 percent in the 1998 third quarter, 
with excellent growth in DocuColor 40 revenues but flat revenues 
in color copying due to increased competitive activity and pricing 
pressure.  For the first nine months of 1998, digital product 
revenues grew 38 percent with over half the growth driven by the 
Document Centre digital copier family. Color copying and printing 
grew 24 percent, production publishing grew 17 percent and 
production printing grew 6 percent.

Black-and-white light lens copier revenues declined 15 percent in 
the 1998 third quarter as a result of some weakness in worldwide 
economic conditions and continued pricing pressures, as well as 
customer transition to the company's digital copiers. These 
revenues were 40 percent of total revenues in the 1998 third 
quarter compared with 50 percent of total revenues in the 1997 
third quarter.  Black-and-white light lens copier revenue declined 
9 percent for the first nine months of 1998.

Geographically, the pre-currency revenue growth rates are as 
follows:

Third quarter and year to date U.S. revenue growth was driven by 
excellent digital equipment sales and document outsourcing.

Xerox Limited and related companies manufacture and market Xerox 
products principally in Europe. Xerox Limited revenue growth in 
the 1998 third quarter and the first nine months of 1998 was 
driven by excellent digital equipment sales and document 
outsourcing growth, and strong growth in supplies.  The U.K. and 
Italy had strong revenue growth in the third quarter, Spain had 
good growth, France and Holland had essentially flat revenues, 
while revenue in Germany declined.  In the first nine months of 
1998, Holland, Italy and Spain had strong revenue growth, the UK 
had good growth, France had modest growth while revenue in Germany 
was essentially flat.

Other Areas include operations principally in Latin America, 
Canada, China and Russia. Revenue in Brazil declined by 10 percent 
in the 1998 third quarter as customers deferred purchases due to 
the weak economic environment, although there was modest growth in 
digital product revenues.  Although our operations in Russia are 
relatively small, with full year 1997 revenues of less than $100 
million, there was a very significant revenue decline in the 1998 
third quarter. Canada and a number of the smaller Latin American 
affiliates, including Argentina  and Colombia, had good revenue 
growth in the third quarter.  Revenue in Other Areas grew 4 
percent during the first nine months of 1998.  Revenue growth in 
Canada and Mexico was strong while revenue in Brazil declined 
modestly.

Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., an unconsolidated entity, jointly owned by 
Xerox Limited and Fuji Photo Film Company Limited, develops, 
manufactures and distributes document processing products in 
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other areas of the Pacific Rim.  
Fuji Xerox revenue declined by 6 percent in the 1998 third quarter 
reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in Japan and a double-digit 
decline in Fuji Xerox' other Asia Pacific territories.  For the 
first nine months, revenue declined by 3 percent due to a modest 
decline in Japan and a double-digit-decline in Fuji Xerox' other 
Asia Pacific territories.

*Excludes equipment in outsourcing contracts that are accounted 
for as sales.

Equipment sales in the 1998 third quarter grew 7 percent as 
revenues declined in Brazil and Russia due to their weak economies 
and we experienced some softness in several European countries.  
Excluding Brazil and Russia, equipment sales grew 12 percent.  
Approximately 55 percent of 1998 third quarter equipment sales was 
due to products introduced since 1997, including the company's 
expanding line of black-and-white digital copiers, the DocuTech 
6180, the DocuColor Office 6, and the N series of network printers 
sold through indirect channels.  Equipment sales in the first nine 
months of 1998 grew 14 percent primarily due to excellent growth 
in digital products.

Supplies sales growth slowed in the 1998 third quarter primarily 
due to paring back of inventory by our indirect sales channels 
customers.  For the first nine months of 1998, supply sales 
increased 7 percent primarily due to growth in indirect channels 
and competitive supplies.

Paper sales: Our strategy is to charge a spread over mill 
wholesale prices to cover our costs and value added as a 
distributor. Flat revenue in the 1998 third quarter reflects 
slight volume increases due to expanding distribution channels, 
offset by moderating industry prices due to excess worldwide 
inventory.  Good revenue growth in the first nine months of 1998 
is primarily due to volume increases due to expanding distribution 
channels partially offset by moderating industry prices.

Combined service, rental, document outsourcing and other revenues 
grew 6 percent in the 1998 third quarter and 5 percent in the 
first nine months of 1998. Service revenues grew 1 percent as the 
impact of higher machine populations resulting from higher 
equipment sales was partially offset by customer preference for 
document outsourcing and competitive price pressures. Rental 
revenues continued to decline, due primarily to customers' 
preference for purchase or document outsourcing rather than 
rental.

Document Outsourcing revenues are split between Equipment Sales 
and Document Outsourcing. Where document outsourcing contracts 
include revenue accounted for as equipment sales, this revenue is 
included as Equipment Sales on the income statement.  All other 
document outsourcing revenue, including service, equipment rental, 
supplies, paper, and labor, are included in 
Service/Rentals/Outsourcing/Other on the income statement.  This 
has the effect of diverting some revenues from supplies, paper, 
service and rental.  The continuing excellent Document Outsourcing 
growth reflects the trend of customers to focus on their core 
businesses and outsource their document processing requirements to 
Xerox.  The growth rate for total document outsourcing revenue is 
substantially higher than the growth included in 
Service/Rentals/Outsourcing/Other, reflecting an increase in the 
proportion of equipment in outsourcing contracts accounted for as 
sales.

Finance income: Our strategy for financing equipment sales in the 
industrialized economies is to charge a spread over our cost of 
borrowing and to lock in that spread by match funding the finance 
receivables with borrowings of similar maturities. Good growth in 
finance income in the 1998 third quarter and the first nine months 
of 1998 is the result of strong growth in the financing of 
equipment sales in Latin America, good growth in the U.S., and 
modest growth in Europe.

Key Ratios and Expenses

The trend in key ratios was as follows:
 
			      1997                       1998    _
		   Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    FY       Q1    Q2    Q3
 
 Gross Margin    46.4% 47.8% 46.5% 47.0% 46.9%    45.0% 45.6% 46.2%
 SAG % Revenue   29.2  29.5  29.5  27.1  28.7     27.9  27.3  27.7
 
The gross margin declined by 0.3 percentage points in the 1998 
third  quarter from the 1997 third quarter, significantly less 
than the gross margin decline in the first half of the year.  The 
modest third quarter gross margin decline was due to the 
increasing proportion of lower margin indirect channels and 
Document Outsourcing business, continued competitive price 
pressures, and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by 
manufacturing and service productivity.  The 45.6 percent gross 
margin for the first nine months of 1998 was 1.3 percentage points 
lower than the first nine months of 1997 primarily due to the 
factors mentioned above and weaker results in Brazil.  The gross 
margin for the first nine months of 1998, including the 
restructuring charge was 44.8 percent.  

Selling, administrative and general expenses (SAG) declined 1 
percent in the 1998 third quarter from the 1997 third quarter due 
to significant declines in general and administrative expenses 
partially offset by increased sales coverage and advertising 
investments.  SAG was 27.7 percent of revenue in the 1998 third 
quarter and 27.6 percent of revenue for the first nine months of 
1998, 1.8 percentage points better than the 1997 third quarter and 
the first nine months of 1997 due to continuing productivity 
initiatives and expense controls, including the initial benefits 
from our worldwide restructuring program, as well as the 
increasing proportion of our business conducted through indirect 
channels and Document Outsourcing.

Research and development (R&D) expense in the 1998 third quarter 
was essentially flat with the 1997 third quarter. We continue to 
invest in technological development to maintain our premier 
position in the rapidly changing document processing market with 
an added focus on increasing the effectiveness of that investment 
and time to market.  We expect R&D spending will be relatively 
flat for the full year.  Xerox R&D is strategically coordinated 
with that of Fuji Xerox which invested $612 million in R&D in the 
1997 full year, for a combined total of $1.7 billion.

Worldwide employment declined by 500 in the 1998 third quarter to 
92,900 as a result of 1,700 employees leaving the company under 
the worldwide restructuring program partially offset by the net 
hiring of 1,200 employees, primarily for the company's fast-
growing document outsourcing business and the acquisition of an 
Eastern European dealer.
 
The increase in other expenses, net, from the 1997 third quarter 
and the first nine months of 1997 was due primarily to increased 
non-financing interest expense and the planned increase in year 
2000 remediation expenses. 

Income Taxes (Benefits), Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated 
Affiliates and Minorities' Interests in the Earnings of 
Subsidiaries

Income before income taxes increased 20 percent to $540 million in 
the 1998 third quarter from $450 million in the 1997 third 
quarter.

We estimate that the impact of currency on third quarter earnings 
was about neutral which follows an adverse impact of approximately 
$0.20 per share in the first half.  If mid-October spot rates 
continue, we would expect currency to benefit our 1998 fourth 
quarter results by somewhat less than $0.05 per share compared to 
a year ago.  Under this scenario, currency will adversely affect 
our earnings by about $0.15 to $0.20 per share for the full year, 
after an adverse impact of $0.35 per share in 1997.  Assuming mid-
October spot rates hold through 1999, currency could benefit our 
earnings by about $0.20 per share year-over-year representing the 
first positive impact in the past several years.

The effective tax rate was 32 percent in the 1998 third quarter, 
which is consistent with the first half and the full year 
expectation. The 2.2 percentage point decline from the 1997 third 
quarter is due to the worldwide mix of profits as well as a tax 
refund in 1998.

Equity in the net income of unconsolidated affiliates is 
principally the Xerox Limited share of Fuji Xerox income. Total 
equity in net income decreased in the 1998 third quarter due to 
lower Fuji Xerox income reflecting difficult economic conditions 
in Japan and their Asia Pacific operations and adverse currency 
translation.  We expect the difficult economic conditions in Japan 
and the Pacific Rim to continue to adversely affect Fuji Xerox' 
operations and that their earnings, before currency translation, 
will be lower than 1997 for the balance of the year.

Minorities' Interests were unchanged and primarily reflect the 
dividends on $650 million of mandatorily redeemable preferred 
stock issued through a trust in January 1997 to reduce debt.  
 
 On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring program 
associated with enhancing our competitive position and lowering 
our overall cost structure. In connection with this program, we 
recorded a second-quarter pretax provision of $1,644 million 
($1,107 million after taxes and including our share of the Fuji 
Xerox restructuring charge).  The program will include the 
elimination of approximately 9,000 jobs worldwide, the closing and 
consolidation of facilities, and the write-down of certain assets.  
The pre-tax charges associated with this action include $113 
million of inventory charges recorded as cost of revenues.  Key 
initiatives of the restructuring will include:
1) Consolidating 56 European customer support centers into one
   facility and implementing a shared services organization which
   will generate order entry, invoicing, and other back-office and
   sales operations.
2) Streamlining manufacturing, logistics, distribution and service
   operations.  This will include centralizing U.S. parts depots 
   and outsourcing storage and distribution.
3) Overhauling our internal processes and associated resources,
   including closing one of four geographically-organized U.S.
   customer administrative centers.

The reductions will occur primarily in administrative functions, 
but will also impact service, research and manufacturing.

The following table summarizes the status of the restructuring 
reserve (in millions):
					     Charges  September30,
				   Original  Against      1998
				   Reserve   Reserve    Balance
Severance and related costs         $1,017    $185      $   832
Asset impairment                       316     316            -
Lease cancellation and other costs     198      15          183
Inventory charges                      113     113            -
Total                               $1,644    $629      $ 1,015

When fully implemented, the ongoing pre-tax savings from the 
restructuring initiatives will be approximately $1 billion 
annually. Initially, more than half of the savings will be 
reinvested to implement process and systems changes in order to 
enable the restructuring, and in ongoing efforts to broaden and 
strengthen marketing programs and distribution channels to enhance 
revenue growth.

Selling, administrative and general expenses as a percentage of 
revenue will move from the high 20's to the low 20's over time, 
driven primarily by large reductions in overhead costs.  
Manufacturing and service productivity will also improve.  These 
benefits will be somewhat offset by lower gross margins overall 
due to the increasing proportion of business conducted through 
indirect sales channels and outsourcing.

As of September 30, 1998, approximately 3,200 employees had left 
the company under the restructuring program.  The restructuring 
reserve balance at September 30, 1998 relates to cash expenditures 
to be incurred primarily during the remainder of 1998 and in 1999.

In April 1998, we announced that we were reactivating our $1 
billion stock repurchase program, which was suspended last year 
when we acquired the remaining financial interest in Rank Xerox, 
now Xerox Limited.  During the third quarter, the company 
repurchased 1.1 million shares at a cost of $100 million for an 
average price of $88 per share.  Since the program inception, 
share repurchases total 10.1 million shares for $568 million.

In May 1998, the company completed the $413 million acquisition of 
XLConnect Solutions, Inc., an information technology services 
company, and its parent company, Intelligent Electronics, Inc.  
The results of operations for these companies have been included 
in our results of operations since the date of acquisition.

The Year 2000 (Y2K) problem is the result of computer programs 
written in two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable 
year.  As a result, many information systems are unable to 
properly recognize and process date-sensitive information beyond 
December 31, 1999.  As with all major companies, certain of our 
information systems and products  require remediation or 
replacement over the next year in order to render these systems 
Year 2000 compliant.

We have divided the Year 2000 project into five major sections: 
Information Technology; and the non-Information Technology areas 
of  Facilities, Vendor Compliance, Product Compliance and 
Facilities Management products and services.  The general phases 
common to all sections are: 1) Awareness - a strategic approach 
was developed to address the Year 2000 problem.  2)  Assessment - 
detailed plans and target dates were developed.  3) Programming - 
includes hardware and software upgrades, systems replacements, 
vendor certification and other associated changes.  4) Testing - 
includes testing and conversion of system applications.  5) 
Implementation - includes compliance achievement and user 
acceptance.

The Information Technology section includes applications 
(software), compute (mainframe/smaller computer environments), 
infrastructure (networks, servers, and workstations), and 
telecommunications.  The status of each section is as follows:

Applications - 60 percent of the mission critical applications are 
Y2K compliant, with an additional 23 percent in the process of 
compliance testing.  The remaining balance is in the process of 
remediation design.  We estimate that 90-95 percent of our 
applications will be compliant by December 31, 1998 with the 
balance achieving compliance by early 1999.

Compute - 76 percent of our mainframe/smaller computer 
environments have been upgraded to be Y2K compliant with the 
remainder scheduled to be upgraded by December 31, 1998.

Infrastructure - 32 percent of networks, servers, and workstations 
have been upgraded to be Y2K compliant with the remainder to be 
upgraded by mid-1999.

Telecommunications - 23 percent of internal mission critical 
components are Y2K compliant, 51 percent are in the implementation 
stage while the remaining 26 percent are in the programming stage.  
We anticipate achieving compliance in this area by mid-1999.

Our Y2K project requires a majority of application systems be 
remediated by December 31, 1998, or one year earlier than the 
recognized failure date of 2000.  For the 90-95 percent of our 
applications that will be compliant by December 31, 1998, no 
contingency plan is necessary.  In those instances where 
completion by the end of 1998 is not assured, appropriate and 
unique contingency plans are in place, in development, or yet to 
be determined.

The Facilities section, which includes electrical systems, 
elevators, access control, security systems, etc., is primarily in 
the assessment phase.  We anticipate achieving compliance by 
August 1, 1999.

We began our efforts in the Vendor Compliance area in November 
1997.  A general awareness letter was sent to all external 
suppliers, and an assessment survey was sent to all business 
critical suppliers.  However, the response rate to this survey was 
poor.  Due to the poor response rate and the low-level of 
confidence gained from responses to surveys, we decided to focus 
our efforts along  two fronts.  First, we have initiated efforts 
to evaluate the status of sole source/key proprietary suppliers of 
long lead components as well as non-production suppliers and to 
determine alternatives and contingency plan requirements.  
Secondly, it is our intent to acquire additional inventory by 
December 31, 1999 to ensure continuity of service to our customers 
should our vendors experience Y2K problems. A process is underway 
to determine the right product mix of this additional inventory.  
These procedures are intended to provide a means of managing risk; 
however, no assurance can be given that they will eliminate the 
potential disruption caused by third party failure.

Regarding Product Compliance, we have determined that 
approximately 77% of our product offerings are currently Y2K 
compliant.  An additional 11% are not being assessed for 
compliance as the product has reached its end of life.  The 
remaining 12% of our products will be made compliant by June 30, 
1999.

In Facilities Management, we are currently performing an inventory 
and assessment of all third party components (Xerox products are 
being remediated as part of the Information Technology and Product 
Compliance sections).  We expect that the remediation effort will 
continue through March 31, 1999.

We are also dependent upon our customers for sales and cash flows.  
Y2K interruptions in our customers' operations could result in 
reduced sales, increased inventory or receivable levels and cash 
flow reductions.  While these events are possible, our customer 
base is sufficiently broad to minimize the effects.

Xerox had begun, in 1993, a project to replace the majority of its 
legacy systems which in many cases date back to the 1960s.  These 
efforts continue today.  As to remediation, we currently estimate 
that costs, exclusive of software and systems that are being 
replaced or upgraded in the normal course of business,  will be 
$85 million during 1998, of which $58 million has been expended as 
of September 30, 1998, and $50 million in 1999.  The increase from 
prior estimates is primarily due to costs being incurred in the 
product compliance area.

We believe that the remediation of our information systems and 
products will occur in a timely fashion so that the Y2K problem 
will not result in significant operating problems with our 
operating systems, facilities and products.  However, if such 
remediations or replacements are not completed in a timely manner, 
the Y2K problem could potentially have a material adverse impact 
on our operations.  Possible worst case consequences could include 
an interruption in our ability to: bill and apply collections from 
our customers; manufacture and deliver products to our customers, 
or meet our cash requirement needs.

The Euro.  On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member 
countries of the European Union are scheduled to establish fixed 
conversion rates between their existing currencies and one common 
currency - the euro.  The euro will then trade on currency 
exchanges and may be used in business transactions.  Xerox Limited 
has processes in place to address the systems and business issues 
raised by the euro currency conversion.  These issues include 
among others, 1) the need to adapt computer and other business 
systems and equipment to accommodate euro-denominated 
transactions, and 2) the competitive impact of cross-border price 
transparency, which may make it more difficult for businesses to 
price for local markets for the same products on a country-by-
country basis.  We estimate that the euro conversion will not have 
a material impact on our financial condition or results of 
operations.

New Accounting Standards.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
(SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging 
Activities."  SFAS No. 133 requires companies to recognize all 
derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at their fair value.  
Gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those 
derivatives would be accounted for depending on the use of the 
derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. We do 
not expect this Statement to have a material impact on our 
consolidated financial statements. This Statement is effective for 
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.  We will adopt this 
accounting standard beginning January 1, 2000.

		      Discontinued Operations

The net investment in the discontinued financial services 
businesses which includes Insurance, Other Financial Services and 
Third Party Financing and Real Estate totaled $779 million at 
September 30, 1998 compared with $1,332 million at December 31, 
1997.  The decrease primarily reflects the sale of Westchester 
Specialty Group, Inc. (WSG) and Crum & Forster Holdings, Inc. 
(CFI) and a reserve increase recorded in the first quarter, 
somewhat offset by scheduled funding of reinsurance coverage to 
the present and former Talegen Holdings, Inc. (Talegen) companies 
and The Resolution Group, Inc. (TRG) by Ridge Reinsurance Limited 
(Ridge Re) and interest for the period on the assigned debt.  A 
discussion of the discontinued businesses follows.

Insurance

In 1995, we recorded a $1,546 million after-tax charge in 
connection with agreements to sell all of our "Remaining" 
insurance companies, which included Coregis Group, Inc. (Coregis), 
CFI, Industrial Indemnity Holdings, Inc. (II), WSG, TRG and three 
insurance-related service companies.

On September 11, 1996, those transactions were terminated.  No 
additional charges were considered necessary as a result of the 
termination.  In September 1996, the Board of Directors of Xerox 
formally approved a plan of disposal under which we retained 
investment bankers to assist us in the simultaneous disposition of 
each of the Remaining insurance and service companies.

Significant progress was made during 1997 and 1998 in the 
disposition of the remaining companies. Specifically:

- -  In the first quarter of 1997, we sold certain assets of Apprise 
Corp., one of Talegen's insurance related service companies.  The 
financial terms of this transaction were not material.

- -  In the second quarter of 1997, we completed the sale of Coregis 
for $375 million in cash and the assumption of $75 million in 
debt.

- -  In the third quarter of 1997, we completed the sale of II for 
$365 million in cash and the assumption of $79 million in debt.

- -  In the fourth quarter of 1997, we completed the sale of TRG for 
$150 million in cash and a $462 million performance-based 
instrument to an investor group.  Ultimate recovery of the value 
of this instrument will be dependent on TRG's future cash flows 
available for dividends.

- -  In the first quarter of 1998, we completed the sale of WSG for 
$338 million in cash, less approximately $70 million in 
transaction-related costs.

- - In the third quarter of 1998, we completed the sale of CFI for 
$680 million, including the repayment of $115 million in debt.  In 
connection with the sale, we incurred approximately $75 million in 
transaction-related costs.  

With the completion of the CFI transaction, we have effectively 
completed our disengagement strategy from insurance and financial 
services.  In the first quarter of 1998 an additional  write-down 
of $190 million after-tax was recorded. 

Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI) continues to provide 
aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage to certain of the  
former Talegen and TRG units through Ridge Re, a wholly owned 
subsidiary.  As of October 1998, XFSI is obligated to pay four 
remaining annual premium installments of $43 million, plus finance 
charges for coverage totaling $982 million (which is net of 15 
percent coinsurance).  At September 30, 1998, Ridge Re had 
recognized the discounted value of approximately $661 million of 
the available coverage.

The net investment in Insurance at September 30, 1998 totaled $533 
million compared with a balance of $1,076 million at December 31, 
1997.  The decrease primarily reflects the sale of WSG and CFI and 
the reserve increase recorded in the first quarter of 1998, 
somewhat offset by contractual payments to Ridge Re for annual 
premium installments and associated finance charges and interest 
on the assigned insurance debt.

Other Financial Services

The net investment in Other Financial Services at September 30, 
1998 was $130 million compared with $125 million at December 31, 
1997.

On June 1, 1995, XFSI completed the sale of Xerox Financial 
Services Life Insurance Company and related companies (Xerox 
Life).  In connection with the transaction, OakRe Life Insurance 
Company (OakRe), a wholly-owned XFSI subsidiary, has assumed 
responsibility, via Coinsurance Agreements, for existing Single 
Premium Deferred Annuity (SPDA) policies issued by Xerox Life.  
The Coinsurance Agreements include a provision for the assumption 
(at their election) by the purchaser's companies, of all of the 
SPDA policies at the end of their current rate reset periods.  A 
Novation Agreement with an affiliate of the new owner provides for 
the assumption of the liability under the Coinsurance Agreements 
for any SPDA policies not so assumed.  Other policies (of 
Immediate, Whole Life, and Variable annuities as well as a minor 
amount of SPDAs) were sold and are now the responsibility of the 
purchaser's companies. 

As a result of the Coinsurance Agreements, at September 30, 1998, 
OakRe retained approximately $1.0 billion of investment portfolio 
assets (transferred from Xerox Life) and liabilities related to 
the reinsured SPDA policies.  Interest rates on these policies are 
fixed and were established upon issuance of the respective 
policies.  Substantially all of these policies will reach their 
rate reset periods through the year 2000 and will be assumed under 
the Agreements as described above.  Xerox Life's portfolio was 
designed to recognize that policy renewals extended liability 
"maturities," thereby permitting investments with average duration 
somewhat beyond the rate reset periods.  OakRe's practice is to 
selectively improve this match over time as market conditions 
allow.

In connection with the aforementioned sale, XFSI established a 
$500 million letter of credit and line of credit with a group of 
banks to support OakRe's coinsurance obligations.  The term of 
this letter of credit is five years and it is unused and available 
at September 30, 1998.  Upon a drawing under the letter of credit, 
XFSI has the option to cover the drawing in cash or to draw upon 
the credit line.

Third Party Financing and Real Estate

Third Party Financing and Real Estate assets at September 30, 1998 
totaled $265 million compared with a balance of $298 million at 
December 31, 1997.  The $33 million reduction from the December 
31, 1997 level primarily relates to scheduled run-off in third 
party financing and sales of certain real estate and other 
investments.  Debt associated with these assets totaled $149 
million at September 30, 1998 and $167 million at December 31, 
1997.

		  Capital Resources and Liquidity

Total debt, including ESOP and discontinued operations debt not 
shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets, was $15,134 
million at September 30, 1998 or $2,231 million more than at 
December 31, 1997.  The changes in consolidated indebtedness since 
year-end and versus the first nine months of 1997 are summarized 
as follows (in millions):

Non-Financing Operations

Non-financing cash usage during the first nine months of 1998 has 
increased significantly compared with the first nine months of 
1997 as explained below.  It should be noted, however, that our 
non-financing operations have historically generated significant 
amounts of cash in the fourth quarter of the year.

Cash usage was $1,115 million and $173 million during the first 
nine months of 1998 and 1997, respectively.  Net income before 
depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, and the 
change in deferred income taxes increased $154 million to $1,542 
million for the first nine months of 1998.  However, this was more 
than offset by cash expenditures against the 1998 restructuring 
reserve, increased inventory investment in support of accelerated 
digital product sales growth, higher accounts receivable due to 
stronger equipment sales growth and some increase in days sales 
outstanding due to the temporary effects from the reorganization 
and consolidation of U.S. customer administrative centers, and 
settlement in 1998 of compensation obligations.

Financing Businesses

Financing business debt growth of $647 million during the first 
nine months of 1998 contrasts with a $106 million reduction during 
the first nine months of 1997.  The $753 million period over 
period change reflects strong growth in equipment sales, an 
increase in the length of the average contract originated in 1998 
and currency translation effects due to a significant 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major European 
currencies during the first nine months of 1997.

			 Risk Management

We have entered into certain financial instruments to manage 
interest rate and foreign currency exposures.  These instruments 
are held solely for hedging purposes and include interest rate 
swap agreements, forward exchange contracts and foreign currency 
swap agreements.  We do not enter into derivative instrument 
transactions for trading purposes and employ long-standing 
policies prescribing that derivative instruments are only to be 
used to achieve a set of very limited objectives.

Currency derivatives are primarily arranged in conjunction with 
underlying transactions that give rise to foreign currency-
denominated payables and receivables; for example, an option to 
buy foreign currency to settle the importation of goods from 
suppliers, or a forward exchange contract to fix the U.S. dollar 
value of a foreign currency-denominated loan.  In addition, when 
cost-effective, currency derivatives are used to hedge balance 
sheet exposures.

Revenues denominated in currencies where the local currency is the 
functional currency are not hedged.

With regard to interest rate hedging, virtually all customer 
financing assets earn fixed rates of interest and, therefore, we 
"lock in" an interest rate spread by arranging fixed-rate 
liabilities with similar maturities as the underlying assets.  
Additionally, customer financing assets in one currency are 
consistently funded with liabilities in the same currency.  We 
refer to the effect of these conservative practices as "match 
funding" customer financing assets. This practice effectively 
eliminates the risk of a major decline in interest margins 
resulting from adverse changes in the interest rate environment.  
Conversely, this practice effectively eliminates the opportunity 
to materially increase margins when interest rates are declining.

More specifically, pay fixed-rate and receive variable-rate swaps 
are typically used in place of more expensive fixed-rate debt.  
Pay variable-rate and receive variable-rate swaps are used to 
transform variable-rate medium-term debt into commercial paper or 
LIBOR obligations.  Additionally, pay variable-rate and receive 
fixed-rate swaps are used from time to time to transform longer-
term fixed-rate debt into commercial paper or LIBOR obligations. 
The transactions performed within each of these three categories 
enable cost-effective management of interest rate exposures.  The 
potential risk attendant to this strategy is the non-performance 
of a swap counterparty.  We address this risk by arranging swaps 
exclusively with a diverse group of strong-credit counterparties, 
regularly monitoring their credit ratings, and determining the 
replacement cost, if any, of existing transactions.

Our currency and interest rate hedging is typically unaffected by 
changes in market conditions as forward contracts, options and 
swaps are normally held to maturity consistent with our objective 
to lock in currency rates and interest rate spreads on the 
underlying transactions.

   fixed charges (1)(2)  0.79     3.32    3.64   3.71    3.54    3.23    0.66

(1) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on the 
    Company's continuing operations by dividing total earnings available for 
    fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest and preferred stock
    dividends of subsidiaries, by total fixed charges.  Fixed charges consist
    of interest, including capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends
    of subsidiaries, and one-third of rent expense as representative of the
    interest portion of rentals.  Debt has been assigned to discontinued
    operations based on historical levels assigned to the businesses when
    they were continuing operations, adjusted for subsequent paydowns.
    Discontinued operations consist of the Company's Insurance, Other
    Financial Services, and Third Party Financing and Real Estate businesses.

(2) The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of 
    the Company's finance subsidiaries, which primarily finance Xerox 
    equipment.  Financing businesses are more highly leveraged and,
    therefore, tend to operate at lower earnings to fixed charges ratio 
    levels than do non-financial businesses.

*   Earnings for the nine months of 1998 were inadequate to cover fixed
    charges.  The coverage deficiency was $150 million.  Excluding the
    restructuring charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would be 3.14.

**  1993 earnings were inadequate to cover fixed charges.  The coverage 
    deficiency was $249 million.

*** Sum of "Income (Loss) before Income Taxes (Benefits), Equity Income and
    Minorities' Interests" and "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates."
