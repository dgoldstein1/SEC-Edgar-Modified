Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time Xerox Corporation (the Registrant or the Company) and its 
representatives may provide information, whether orally or in writing, 
including certain statements in this Form 10-Q under "Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ," which are 
deemed to be "forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("Litigation Reform Act").  These forward-
looking statements and other information relating to the Company are based on 
the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information 
currently available to management.

The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," and 
similar expressions, as they relate to the Company or the Company's 
management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Such 
statements reflect the current views of the Registrant with respect to future 
events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.  
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should 
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially 
from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.  
The Registrant does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.

In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act we are making 
investors aware that such "forward-looking" statements, because they relate to 
future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors 
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in 
the "forward-looking" statements.  Such factors include but are not limited to 
the following:

Competition - the Registrant operates in an environment of significant 
competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of 
customers to become more efficient.  There are a number of companies worldwide 
with significant financial resources which compete with the Registrant to 
provide document processing products and services in each of the markets 
served by the Registrant, some of whom operate on a global basis.  The 
Registrant's success in its future performance is largely dependent upon its 
ability to compete successfully in its currently-served  markets and to expand 
into additional market segments.  

Transition to Digital - presently black and white light-lens copiers represent 
approximately 35% of the Registrant's revenues.  This segment of the general 
office is mature with anticipated declining industry revenues as the market 
transitions to digital technology.  Some of the Registrant's new digital 
products replace or compete with the Registrant's current light-lens 
equipment.  Changes in the mix of products from light-lens to digital, and the 
pace of that change as well as competitive developments could cause actual 
results to vary from those expected.

Pricing - the Registrant's ability to succeed is dependent upon its ability to 
obtain adequate pricing for its products and services which provide a 
reasonable return to shareholders.  Depending on competitive market factors, 
future prices the Registrant can obtain for its products and services may vary 
from historical levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset devaluations 
may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may not hold in the 
face of customer resistance and/or competition.

Financing Business - a significant portion of the Registrant's profits arise 
from the financing of its customers' purchase of the Registrant's equipment.  
On average, 75 to 80 percent of equipment sales are financed through the 
Registrant.  The Registrant's ability to provide such financing at competitive 
rates and realize profitable spreads is highly dependent upon its own costs of 
borrowing which, in turn, depend upon its credit ratings.  Significant changes 
in such ratings could reduce the profitability of such financing business 
and/or make the Registrant's financing less attractive to customers thus 
reducing the volume of financing business done.  The Registrant's present 
credit ratings permit ready access to the credit markets.  There is no 
assurance that these credit ratings can be maintained and/or ready access to 
the credit markets can be assured.

Productivity - the Registrant's ability to sustain and improve its profit 
margins is largely dependent on its ability to maintain an efficient, cost-
effective operation.  Productivity improvements through process reengineering, 
design efficiency and supplier cost improvements are required to offset labor 
cost inflation and potential materials cost changes and competitive price 
pressures.

International Operations - the Registrant derives approximately half its 
revenue from operations outside of the United States.  In addition, the 
Registrant manufactures many of its products and/or their components outside 
the United States.  The Registrant's future revenue, cost and profit results 
could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in 
foreign currency exchange rates, changes in economic conditions from country 
to country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection 
measures, licensing requirements and local tax issues.

New Products/Research and Development - the process of developing new high 
technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain.  It 
requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging 
technological trends.  The Registrant must then make long-term investments and 
commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will 
eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate 
the revenues required to provide anticipated returns from these investments.

Revenue Growth - Registrant's ability to attain a consistent trend of revenue 
growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon 
expansion of its equipment sales worldwide.  The ability to achieve equipment 
sales growth is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to 
provide industry-oriented global solutions for major customers and expansion  
of its distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing 
pressures.  Our inability to attain a consistent trend of revenue growth could 
materially affect the trend of our actual results.

Restructuring - the Registrant's ability to ultimately reduce pre-tax annual 
expenditures by approximately $1 billion is dependent upon its ability to 
successfully implement the 1998 restructuring program including the 
elimination of 9,000 jobs, net, worldwide, the closing and consolidation of 
facilities, and the successful implementation of process and systems changes.

Year 2000 - the Registrant's ability to complete its Year 2000 plan is 
dependent upon the availability of resources, the Registrant's ability to 
discover and correct the potential Year 2000 sensitive problems which could 
have a serious impact on the Registrant's information management systems, 
facilities and products, and the ability of the Registrant's suppliers and 
customers to bring their systems into Year 2000 compliance.

presented herein have been prepared by Xerox Corporation ("the 
Company") in accordance with the accounting policies described in 
its 1998 Annual Report to Shareholders and should be read in 
conjunction with the notes thereto.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of 
normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair 
statement of operating results for the interim periods presented 
have been made.

Prior years' financial statements have been restated to reflect 
certain reclassifications to conform with the 1999 presentation. 
The impact of these changes is not material and did not affect 
net income.

3.  On January 25, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a two-
for-one split of the Company's common stock. The effective date 
of the stock split was February 23 for shareholders of record as 
of February 4. Shareholders' equity has been restated to give 
retroactive recognition to the stock split in prior periods by 
reclassifying from additional paid-in capital to common stock the 
par value of the additional shares arising from the split. In 
addition, all references in the financial statements to number of 
shares and per-share amounts have been restated.


4.  On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring 
program associated with enhancing our competitive position and 
lowering our overall cost structure. In connection with this 
program, in the second quarter of 1998 we recorded a pre-tax 
provision of $1,644 million ($1,107 million after taxes and 
including our $18 million share of a restructuring charge 
recorded by Fuji Xerox).  The program includes the elimination of 
approximately 9,000 jobs, net, worldwide, the closing and 
consolidation of facilities, and the write-down of certain 
assets.  The charges associated with this restructuring program 
include $113 million of inventory charges recorded as cost of 
revenues and $316 million of asset impairments.  Included in the 
asset impairment charge are facility fixed assets write-downs of 
$156 million and other asset write-downs of $160 million.  For 
facility fixed assets classified as assets to be disposed of, the 
impairment loss recognized is based on fair value less cost to 
sell, with fair value based on third-party valuations as well as 
our internal estimates of existing market prices for similar 
assets.  The effect of suspending depreciation on assets no 
longer in use for the first quarter of 1999 is not material.  The 
remaining $160 million of asset impairments includes the write-
down of certain technology assets and other items impacted by the 
consolidation activities described below.  Key initiatives of the 
restructuring include:
1) Consolidating 56 European customer support centers into one
   facility and implementing a shared services organization for
   order entry, invoicing, and other back-office and sales
   operations.
2) Streamlining manufacturing, logistics, distribution and
   service operations.  This will include centralizing U.S. parts
   depots  and outsourcing storage and distribution.
3) Overhauling our internal processes and associated resources,
   including closing one of four geographically-organized U.S.
   customer administrative centers.
 
 The reductions are occurring primarily in administrative 
functions, but also impact service, research and manufacturing.
 
 The following table summarizes the status of the restructuring 
reserve (in millions):

 As of March 31, 1999, approximately 6,400 employees have left the 
Company under the restructuring program.
 
 There have been no material changes to the program since its 
announcement in April 1998, and the majority of the remaining 
reserve will be utilized throughout the remainder of 1999 and 
2000.

8.  Litigation 
     
Continuing Operations

On March 10, 1994, a lawsuit was filed in the United States 
District Court for the District of Kansas by two independent 
service organizations (ISOs) in Kansas City and St. Louis and 
their parent company. Subsequently, a single corporate entity, 
CSU, L.L.C.("CSU") was substituted for the three affiliated 
companies. CSU claimed damages predominately resulting from the 
Company's alleged refusal to sell parts for high volume copiers 
and printers to CSU prior to 1994. The Company's policies and 
practices with respect to the sale of parts to ISOs were at issue 
in an antitrust class action in Texas, which was settled by the 
Company during 1994. Claims for individual lost profits of ISOs 
who were not named parties, such as CSU, were not included in 
that class action.  The Company asserted counterclaims against 
CSU alleging patent and copyright infringement relating to the 
copying of diagnostic software and service manuals.  On April 8, 
1997, the District Court granted partial summary judgment in 
favor of the Company on CSU's antitrust claims, ruling that the 
Company's unilateral refusal to sell or license its patented 
parts cannot give rise to antitrust liability.  On January 8, 
1999,  the Court dismissed with prejudice  all of CSU's  
antitrust claims.  CSU has preserved for appeal only its claims 
that Xerox  unlawfully  refused to sell  critical parts 
(including patented parts), to sell manuals  and to license 
patented and copyrighted  software and its claim that   the 
Company's  refusal to sell non-critical parts was unlawful  
because it was in conjunction with an allegedly unlawful refusal 
to sell critical parts.  The District Court also granted summary 
judgment in favor of the Company on its patent infringement 
claim, leaving open with respect to patent infringement only the 
issues of willfulness and the amount of damages, and granted 
partial summary judgment in favor of the Company with respect to 
some of its claims of copyright infringement.   A judgment  in 
the amount of  $1,039,282 was entered  in favor of  the Company 
and against CSU on the  copyright infringement counterclaim.   
CSU  has filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

   On April 11, 1996, an action was commenced by Accuscan Corp. 
(Accuscan), in the United States District Court for the Southern 
District of New York, against the Company seeking unspecified 
damages for infringement of a patent of Accuscan which expired in 
1993. The suit, as amended, was directed to facsimile and certain 
other products containing scanning functions and sought damages 
for sales between 1990 and 1993. On April 1, 1998, the jury 
entered a verdict in favor of Accuscan for $40 million.  However, 
on September 14, 1998, the Court granted the Company's motion for 
a new trial on damages.  The Company is also seeking to appeal 
the issue of liability and believes that the liability verdict 
should be set aside.  A new trial on damages is set for August, 
1999.

   On December 18, 1998, three former employees of Crum & Forster 
Holdings, Inc. (a former subsidiary of ours) ("C&F") filed a 
lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of 
New Jersey claiming wrongful termination of their participation 
in the Xerox Corporation Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"). 
Xerox, the ESOP, C&F and the company that acquired C&F are named 
defendants.  Plaintiffs purport to bring this action on behalf of 
themselves and a class of approximately 10,000 persons who were 
employed by C&F (or one of its insurance subsidiaries which also 
participated in the ESOP) from July 1, 1989 through December 31, 
1993.  Plaintiffs assert violations of the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act, breach of contract, conversion, unjust 
enrichment and fraudulent misrepresentation.  They are seeking 
approximately $250 million in damages.

   The foregoing action is related to an action previously filed 
in the United States District Court for the Western District of 
Texas. The Texas plaintiffs did not specify their damages, but 
they sought certification of a similar class of former ESOP 
participants. Plaintiffs' motion for class certification was  
denied by the Court on March 26, 1999.  The plaintiffs have asked 
the Court to reconsider its decision.

   We deny any wrongdoing and we intend to vigorously defend both 
the Texas and New Jersey actions.



9. Subsequent Event

In May, 1999 Xerox Capital (Europe) plc, an indirect wholly owned 
subsidiary of ours, issued 5.75% debentures maturing May 15, 2002 
for net proceeds of $498 million and 5.875% debentures maturing 
May 15, 2004 for net procceds of $496 million.  The 5.75% 
debentures pay interest semi-annually and were issued at an 
effective interest rate of 5.82% per annum.  The 5.875% 
debentures pay interest semi-annually and were issued at an 
effective interest rate of 5.99% per annum. The proceeds were 
used to reduce commercial paper borrowings. 

Item 2                   Xerox Corporation
             Management's Discussion and Analysis of
           Results of Operations and Financial Condition

 Document Processing

Summary

Income from continuing operations increased 14 percent to $343 
million in the 1999 first quarter from $301 million in the 1998 
first quarter.  The increase was primarily due to improved 
operating margins that reflected ongoing benefits from the 
company's worldwide restructuring program and a heightened focus 
on productivity and expense controls.  The productivity and 
expense control actions included significant cost reductions in 
our Brazilian operations, encompassing branch consolidations and 
centralization of administrative support functions, as well as 
additional worldwide cost constraints. 

Pre-currency revenues, excluding Brazil, grew 3 percent, 
reflecting revenue growth of 4 percent in the United States and 2 
percent in Europe. U.S. and European revenue growth was depressed 
in the 1999 first quarter, reflecting the impact of the 
implementation of initiatives announced in January 1999 to 
provide industry-oriented global document solutions for major 
customers.  These initiatives required substantial one-time 
investments, including enhanced sales training and development 
and some changes in customer relationships, which impacted first 
quarter sales productivity more than anticipated. Including 
Brazil and the effects of currency, revenues of $4.3 billion were 
flat compared with the first quarter of 1998. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 
14 percent to $0.48 in the 1999 first quarter from $0.42 in the 
1998 first quarter.

Pre-Currency Growth

To understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is 
helpful to adjust revenue and expense growth (except for ratios) 
to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of foreign 
currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to this adjusted growth as 
"pre-currency growth." Latin American amounts are shown at actual 
exchange rates for both pre-currency and post-currency reporting, 
since these countries generally have volatile currency and 
inflationary environments, and our operations in these countries 
traditionally implement pricing actions to recover the impact of 
inflation and devaluation. 

A substantial portion of our consolidated revenues is derived 
from operations outside of the United States where the U.S. 
dollar is not the functional currency. When compared with the 
average of the major European currencies on a revenue-weighted 
basis, the U.S. dollar was approximately 3 percent weaker in the 
1999 first quarter than in the 1998 first quarter.  As a result, 
European currency translation had a favorable impact of 
approximately 1 percentage point on revenue growth. 

The total unfavorable impact of our Brazilian Operations on our 
revenue growth was approximately 4 percentage points. This 
included the very significant currency devaluation as the Real 
weakened to an average exchange rate of 1.73 in the 1999 first 
quarter compared with 1.13 in the 1998 first quarter, and weaker 
activity as interest rates in Brazil remained high.  
Operationally, significant price increases were implemented which 
are intended to offset the effect of the devaluation over time. 
Revenues denominated in currencies where the local currency is 
the functional currency, including the Brazilian Real, are not 
hedged for purposes of translation into U.S. dollars.

Revenues

Total pre-currency revenues declined 1 percent in the 1999 first 
quarter, but grew 3 percent excluding Brazil.  For the major 
product categories, the pre-currency revenue growth rates are as 
follows:
                               1998	                   1999   .

                                                        Brazil)
Total Revenues          10%  10%   6%   7%    8%    (1)%   3%

Light-Lens Copiers      (4)  (8) (15) (16)  (11)   (24)  (20)

Digital product revenues, which grew 28 percent in the 1999 first 
quarter, 33 percent excluding Brazil, were driven by the 
continued outstanding revenue growth from our expanding family of 
black-and-white Document Centre digital multi-function products 
and reached 48 percent of total revenues compared with 38 percent 
of total revenues in the 1998 first quarter. Production 
publishing revenues grew 12 percent in the 1999 first quarter 
consistent with recent trends but production printing revenue 
declined 6 percent due primarily to lower activity.  Color 
copying and printing growth was 8 percent in the 1999 first 
quarter with strong growth in DocuColor 40 revenues and excellent 
DocuColor 70 and indirect channels growth.  Office color copier 
revenue declined as unit volumes declined, and pricing pressure 
and some shift to less-featured models continued. Our DocuPrint N 
series of monochrome laser printers and new and expanding line of 
monochrome digital copiers sold through indirect sales channels 
continued their excellent growth.   Black-and-white light-lens 
copier revenues declined 24 percent in the 1999 first quarter as 
a result of weakness in Brazil, increased pricing pressures and 
customer transition to digital copiers.

Geographically, the pre-currency revenue growth rates are as 
follows:

                                      1998                1999

Memo: Fuji Xerox             2   (4)   (6)   (4)  (3)      (1)

First quarter revenue growth in both the U.S. and Europe was 
disappointing, slowing significantly from prior quarters due to 
substantial one-time investments, including enhanced sales 
training and development, and some changes in customer 
relationships, associated with the initiatives announced in 
January 1999 to provide industry-oriented global document 
solutions for major customers. These initiatives temporarily 
reduced sales time with customers and impacted sales productivity 
more than anticipated. Sales force retention in both the U.S. and 
Europe continued to be consistent with 1998 trends. In addition, 
statutory regulations and practices associated with the 
implementation of our pan-European approach for customer support 
and back office operations required considerable management time 
and diverted focus from revenue generation.  Within Europe, 
revenues in Germany were flat in the first quarter and revenues 
in France and the U.K. declined modestly, while revenues grew in 
Italy and Eastern Europe.  We are very confident that revenue 
growth in both the U.S. and Europe will improve as the year 
progresses. 

Other Areas include operations principally in Latin America, 
Canada, China, Russia, the Middle East and Africa.  Revenue in 
Brazil declined by 45 percent in the 1999 first quarter 
reflecting primarily the very significant currency devaluation 
and also the Brazilian recession.  Brazilian revenues represented 
approximately 4 percent of Xerox revenues in the 1999 first 
quarter compared with 8 percent in the 1998 first quarter.  
Excluding Brazil, revenue in Other Areas had modest growth. 
China, the Middle East and Africa had strong revenue growth in 
the first quarter, Canada and Mexico had good revenue growth, 
while revenue declined in Argentina, Venezuela and Russia due to 
economic weakness.

Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., an unconsolidated entity jointly owned by 
Xerox Limited and Fuji Photo Film Company Limited, develops, 
manufactures and distributes document processing products in 
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other areas of the Pacific 
Rim.  Fuji Xerox revenue declined by 1 percent in the 1999 first 
quarter reflecting a modest revenue decline in Japan partially 
offset by modest revenue growth in Fuji Xerox' other Asia Pacific 
territories.

The pre-currency growth rates by type of revenue are as follows:

* Excludes equipment in outsourcing contracts that are accounted 
for as sales.

Equipment sales in the 1999 first quarter declined 3 percent and 
were impacted significantly by the currency devaluation and 
recession in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, equipment sales growth 
slowed to 4 percent as North American and European sales 
productivity was impacted more than anticipated by the effects of 
the January initiatives previously discussed.  In addition, 
indirect channels equipment sales growth was temporarily below 
recent trends. Approximately 45 percent of 1999 first quarter 
equipment sales was derived from products introduced since 1997, 
including the company's expanding line of black-and-white 
Document Centre digital multi-function equipment, the DocuTech 
6180 Production Publisher, and the expanding monochrome and color 
laser and inkjet product families sold through indirect channels. 
North American and European equipment sales growth should improve 
significantly beginning in the second quarter.

Excluding Brazil, supplies revenue was flat in the 1999 first 
quarter reflecting diversion of U.S. supplies revenue to document 
outsourcing and some impact of marketing agreements to expand 
supplies distribution providing royalties rather than supplies 
revenue. 

Paper sales: Our strategy is to charge a spread over mill 
wholesale prices to cover our costs and value added as a 
distributor. The first quarter 1999 revenue decline reflects 
slight volume increases due to expanding distribution channels, 
which was more than offset by lower industry prices due to an 
excess of worldwide supply.

Combined service, document outsourcing, rentals and other 
revenues grew 4 percent in the 1999 first quarter and 7 percent 
excluding Brazil. Document Outsourcing revenues are split between 
Equipment Sales and Document Outsourcing. Where document 
outsourcing contracts include revenue accounted for as equipment 
sales, this revenue is included as Equipment Sales.  All other 
document outsourcing revenue, including service, equipment 
rental, supplies, paper and labor, are included in 
Service/Outsourcing/ Rentals/Other. This has the effect of 
diverting significant revenues from supplies, paper, service and 
rental. The continuing excellent Document Outsourcing growth 
reflects the trend of customers focusing on their core businesses 
and outsourcing their document processing requirements to Xerox.  
The growth rate for total document outsourcing revenue is higher 
than the growth included in the Service/Outsourcing/Rentals/Other 
category, reflecting an increase in the proportion of equipment 
in outsourcing contracts accounted for as sales.  Service 
revenues declined 3 percent (excluding Brazil) in the 1999 first 
quarter compared with abnormal growth in the 1998 first quarter 
as the impact of higher machine populations resulting from higher 
equipment sales was more than offset by the impact of the strong 
customer preference for document outsourcing and competitive 
price pressures.

Finance income: Our strategy for financing equipment sales in the 
industrialized economies is to charge a spread over our cost of 
borrowing and to lock in that spread by match funding the finance 
receivables with borrowings of similar maturities. Excluding 
Brazil, modest growth in finance income in the 1999 first quarter 
is the result of continuing good growth in the financing of 
equipment sales in the U.S. partially offset by lower average 
interest rates.
 
Key Ratios and Expenses

The trend in key ratios was as follows: 

                                   	 1998                   1999
                        Q1     Q2     Q3     Q4     FY       Q1

Gross Margin          44.9%  45.6%  46.3%  48.0%  46.3%    45.9%

SAG % Revenue         27.8   27.3   27.7   26.8   27.3     27.2

The gross margin improved by 1.0 percentage points in the 1999 
first quarter from the 1998 first quarter as manufacturing and 
other productivity improvements and favorable currency were only 
partially offset by continuing competitive price pressures and 
business mix impact due primarily to higher revenue growth in 
both the document outsourcing and the indirect channels 
businesses. 

Selling, administrative and general expenses (SAG) declined 2 
percent in the 1999 first quarter from the 1998 first quarter 
driven by a substantial decline in general and administrative 
expenses reflecting the benefits of our 1998 restructuring 
program, our sharpened focus on productivity and expense controls 
implemented in January 1999 to mitigate the impact of the 
economic turmoil in Brazil, as well as the beneficial currency 
translation impact of the devaluation on SAG in Brazil.  In the 
1999 first quarter, SAG represented 27.2 percent of revenue, an 
improvement of 0.6 percentage points from the 1998 first quarter. 

Research and development (R&D) expense in the 1999 first quarter 
increased 7 percent from the 1998 first quarter.  We continue to 
invest in technological development to maintain our premier 
position in the rapidly changing document processing market with 
an added focus on increasing the effectiveness of that investment 
and time to market. Xerox R&D is strategically coordinated with 
that of Fuji Xerox which invested $636 million in R&D in the 1998 
full year, for a combined total of $1.7 billion.

Worldwide employment increased by 100 in the 1999 first quarter 
to 92,800 as a result of the net hiring of 1,100 employees 
substantially offset by 1,000 employees leaving the company under 
the worldwide restructuring program.  The hiring was primarily 
for the company's fast-growing document outsourcing and 
professional services businesses, staffing for the centralized 
European customer care and shared services operations in Ireland 
and research and development skills enhancement.

The $1 million decrease in other expenses, net, from the 1998 
first quarter was primarily due to a small gain on foreign 
currency transactions in 1999 compared with a loss in 1998, and 
several other one-time items which were essentially offset by 
increased non-financing interest expense. The increased non-
financing interest expense was the result of higher debt balances 
partially offset by lower interest rates.
 
Income Taxes, Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates 
and Minorities' Interests in the Earnings of Subsidiaries

Income before income taxes increased 11 percent to $494 million 
in the 1999 first quarter from $445 million in the 1998 first 
quarter.

The effective tax rate, which was 31.0 percent in the 1999 first 
quarter compared with 33.0 percent in the 1998 first quarter, was 
generally consistent with the 1998 full year pre-restructuring 
rate of 31.6 percent.  We expect the 1999 full year tax rate to 
be in line with the 1999 first quarter rate.

Equity in the net income of unconsolidated affiliates is 
principally our 50 percent share of Fuji Xerox income. Total 
equity in net income decreased in the 1999 first quarter due to 
lower Fuji Xerox income, reflecting difficult economic conditions 
in Japan and other Asia Pacific countries. We expect the 
difficult economic conditions in Japan and the Pacific Rim to 
continue to adversely affect Fuji Xerox' operations and it is 
unlikely that their earnings, before currency translation, will 
contribute to Xerox earnings growth in 1999. 

On April 7, 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring program 
associated with enhancing our competitive position and lowering 
our overall cost structure. In connection with this program, in 
the second quarter of 1998 we recorded a pre-tax provision of 
$1,644 million ($1,107 million after taxes and including our $18 
million share of a restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox).  
The program includes the elimination of approximately 9,000 jobs, 
net, worldwide, the closing and consolidation of facilities, and 
the write-down of certain assets.  The charges associated with 
this restructuring program include $113 million of inventory 
charges recorded as cost of revenues and $316 million of asset 
impairments.  Included in the asset impairment charge are 
facility fixed assets write-downs of $156 million and other asset 
write-downs of $160 million.  For facility fixed assets 
classified as assets to be disposed of, the impairment loss 
recognized is based on fair value less cost to sell, with fair 
value based on third-party valuations as well as our internal 
estimates of existing market prices for similar assets.  The 
effect of suspending depreciation on assets no longer in use for 
the first quarter of 1999 is not material.  The remaining $160 
million of asset impairments includes the write-down of certain 
technology assets and other items impacted by the consolidation 
activities described below.  Key initiatives of the restructuring 
include:
1) Consolidating 56 European customer support centers into one
   facility and implementing a shared services organization for
   order entry, invoicing, and other back-office and sales
   operations.
2) Streamlining manufacturing, logistics, distribution and
   service operations.  This will include centralizing U.S. parts
   depots  and outsourcing storage and distribution.
3) Overhauling our internal processes and associated resources,
   including closing one of four geographically-organized U.S.
   customer administrative centers.
 
 The reductions are occurring primarily in administrative 
functions, but also impact service, research and manufacturing.
 
 The following table summarizes the status of the restructuring 
reserve (in millions):

 As of March 31, 1999, approximately 6,400 employees have left the 
Company under the restructuring program.
 
 There have been no material changes to the program since its 
announcement in April 1998, and the majority of the remaining 
reserve will be utilized throughout the remainder of 1999 and 
2000.

In April 1998, we announced that we were reactivating our $1 
billion stock repurchase program, which was suspended when we 
acquired the remaining financial interest in Xerox Limited in 
1997.  During the 1999 first quarter the company did not 
repurchase any stock. Since inception of the program we have 
repurchased 20.6 million shares for $594 million. 

The Year 2000 (Y2K) problem is the result of computer programs 
written in two digits, rather than four, to define the applicable 
year. As a result, many information systems are unable to 
properly recognize and process date-sensitive information beyond 
December 31, 1999. As with all major companies, certain of our 
information systems and products require remediation or 
replacement in order to render these systems Year 2000 compliant. 
Though a majority of our remediation and replacement work has 
been completed, 1999 will be used to finish any remaining 
mission-critical areas and develop and deploy business 
contingency plans.

   We have divided the Year 2000 project into five major 
sections: Information Technology; and the non-Information 
Technology areas of Facilities, Vendor Compliance, Product 
Compliance and Facilities Management products and services. The 
general phases common to all sections are: 1) Awareness - a 
strategic approach was developed to address the Year 2000 
problem. 2) Assessment - detailed plans and target dates were 
developed. 3) Programming - includes hardware and software 
upgrades, systems replacements, vendor certification and other 
associated changes. 4) Testing - includes testing and conversion 
of system applications. 5) Implementation - includes compliance 
achievement and user acceptance.

   The Information Technology section includes applications 
(software), compute (mainframe/smaller computer environments), 
infrastructure (networks, servers, and workstations), and 
telecommunications. The status of each section as of March 31, 
1999, is as follows:
 
   Applications - 97 percent of the mission-critical applications 
are Y2K Compliant and tested. The remaining work is planned for 
completion by the third quarter of 1999.

   Compute - 93 percent of our mainframe/smaller computer 
environments have been upgraded to be Y2K compliant with the 
remainder scheduled to be completed by mid-1999.

   Infrastructure - 83 percent of networks, servers, and 
workstations have been upgraded to be Y2K compliant with the 
remainder to be completed by the third quarter of 1999.

   Telecommunications - 74 percent of internal mission-critical 
components are Y2K compliant with the remainder planned for 
compliance by mid-1999. We continue to assess external public 
utility provider readiness and pursue status on those providers 
who do not respond.  

   The Facilities section, which includes building electrical 
systems, elevators, access control, security systems, etc., is 
primarily in the assessment phase. We are on track for achieving 
compliance of critical owned sites by August 31, 1999.  Leased 
sites are on track and planned for compliance by December 31, 
1999.

   We began our efforts in the Vendor Compliance area in November 
1997.  A general awareness letter was sent to all external 
suppliers, and an assessment survey was sent to all business 
critical suppliers. Follow-up was then initiated to validate 
survey responses and provide a risk profile for each supplier.  

   To date, 70% of mission critical suppliers have been assessed.  
New suppliers have been added to the list and assessments are 
underway.  Of the suppliers assessed, 87% are rated "high 
confidence" as of March 1999.  We will continue to work with the 
13% of suppliers rated "low confidence" to ensure supply 
continuity through 2000.  Assessments for the remaining 30% of 
mission critical suppliers should be completed by June 1999.

   The Y2K process as it relates to our manufacturing operations 
has primarily focused on our first tier suppliers, and given the 
vastness and complexity of our supplier base, we had growing 
concern about the adequacy of a single strategy approach.  In 
response to these concerns, we expect to build an inventory hedge 
on selected key products and critical sole source parts.  This 
inventory coupled with our normal inventory levels will provide 
us with a resolution window to resolve any Y2K issues.  We 
currently expect to acquire up to $100 million of this additional 
inventory which we believe can be utilized in the normal course 
of business during the first half of 2000.  In summary, we 
believe the resolution period incorporated in the Y2K vendor 
strategy is adequate to provide supplier continuity coverage.  
This procedure is intended to provide a means of managing risk; 
however, no assurance can be given that it will eliminate the 
potential disruption caused by third party failure. 
   Our 1999 efforts will include on-site inspection of 20 key 
suppliers in the second quarter of 1999 and contingency planning.

   Regarding Product Compliance, 98% of our products, excluding 
end-of-life products, are Y2K compliant, or we have developed a 
software/hardware patch or have another solution in progress. We 
have implementation plans in place to deploy these Y2K solutions 
so that all in-field Xerox products worldwide will be made 
compliant by mid-1999.

   In Facilities Management, we have completed inventory, 
compliance assessment, and action plans.  Remediation activities 
are underway for all customers; 60% of required remediation of 
third party components has been accomplished. Completion of 
remediation, on-site integrated testing of components and full 
deployment is scheduled for mid-1999. Remediation of Xerox 
products at these sites is being coordinated with the product 
compliance area.

   Contingency Planning--Certain of our processes have in place 
business resumption plans. In addition, we have established a 
contingency program which requires our critical business 
processes to develop alternative plans should our, or third party 
remediation efforts experience unforeseen difficulty.

   We are also dependent upon our customers for sales and cash 
flows. Y2K interruptions in our customers' operations could 
result in reduced sales, increased inventory or receivable levels 
and cash flow reductions. While these events are possible, our 
customer base is sufficiently broad to minimize those risks.

   In 1993, Xerox began a project to replace the majority of its 
legacy systems, which in many cases date back to the 1960s. These 
efforts continue today. As to remediation, we currently estimate 
that costs, exclusive of software and systems that are being 
replaced or upgraded in the normal course of business, and 
including our products and facilities, as well as legacy systems, 
will be $183 million of which $28 million was spent in 1997, $92 
million in 1998, $18 million in the first quarter of 1999.  We 
estimate $45 million will be spent in the remainder of 1999.

   We believe that the remediation of our information systems and 
products will occur in a timely fashion so that the Y2K problem 
will not result in significant operating problems with our 
operating systems, facilities and products. However, if such 
remediations are not completed in a timely manner or if third 
party suppliers of products or services have not completed their 
remediation efforts, the Y2K problem could potentially have a 
material adverse impact on our operations. Possible worst case 
consequences could include an interruption in our ability to: 
bill and apply collections from our customers; manufacture and 
deliver products to our customers; or meet our cash requirement 
needs.


New Accounting Standards.  In June 1998, the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments 
and Hedging Activities."  SFAS No. 133 requires companies to 
recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at 
their fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in the 
values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on 
the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge 
accounting. We do not expect this Statement to have a material 
impact on our consolidated financial statements. This Statement 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999.  We 
will adopt this accounting standard beginning January 1, 2000.




Discontinued Operations

The net investment in the discontinued financial services 
businesses which includes Insurance, Other Financial Services and 
Third Party Financing and Real Estate totaled $762 million at 
March 31, 1999 compared with $759 million at December 31, 1998.  
The change in 1999 was primarily caused by the funding of 
reinsurance coverage for the former Talegen Holdings, Inc. 
(Talegen) companies to Ridge Reinsurance Limited (Ridge Re) and 
interest for the period on the assigned debt, both of which were 
nearly entirely offset by the sale of six of our remaining eight 
financing leases and the sale of other Real Estate investments.  
A discussion of the discontinued businesses follows.

Status of Insurance

In 1995, we recorded a $1,546 million after tax charge in 
connection with the disengagement activities for our five then 
remaining Talegen insurance companies and three related service 
companies.

In 1997, three of the insurance companies and one service company 
were sold.  As part of the consideration for one of the 
companies, The Resolution Group, Inc. (TRG), which closed in the 
fourth quarter of 1997, we received a $462 million performance-
based instrument.  In 1998, the remaining insurance and service 
companies were sold.  In the first quarter, we completed the sale 
of the Westchester Specialty Group, Inc. (WSG) for $338 million 
in cash, less approximately $70 million in transaction-related 
costs.  In the third quarter, we completed the sale of Crum & 
Forster Holdings, Inc. (CFI) for $680 million, including the 
repayment of $115 million in debt, less approximately $75 million 
in transaction-related costs.  With the completion of the CFI 
transaction, we have effectively completed our disengagement 
strategy from the Talegen companies.  In the first quarter of 
1998 an additional after-tax charge of $190 million was recorded.

Xerox Financial Services, Inc. (XFSI) continues to provide 
aggregate excess of loss reinsurance coverage to certain of the 
former Talegen units and TRG through Ridge Re, a wholly owned 
subsidiary. The coverage limits total $748 million, which is net 
of 15 percent coinsurance and exclusive of $234 million in 
coverage which was reinsured under a retrocessional arrangement 
during the fourth quarter of 1998 for a total cost to Ridge Re of 
$158 million.  At March 31, 1999, Ridge Re had recognized the 
discounted value of approximately $454 million of the available 
coverage and it is possible that some additional reserves could 
ultimately be needed, although this is not currently anticipated. 
In April 1999, Ridge Re entered into a novation agreement with 
another insurer to eliminate its obligations for WSG's 
reinsurance coverage.  The coverage limit under WSG's policy was 
$128 million.  In connection with the agreement, Ridge Re paid 
the insurer $95 million. 

XFSI has guaranteed to certain of the former Talegen units and 
TRG that Ridge Re will meet all of its financial obligations 
under the Reinsurance Agreements.  Related premium payments to 
Ridge Re are made by XFSI and guaranteed by us. As of March 31, 
1999, there were three remaining annual premium installments of 
$43 million, plus finance charges. We have also guaranteed that 
Ridge Re will meet its financial obligations on $578 million of 
the Reinsurance Agreements and have provided a $400 million 
partial guaranty of Ridge Re's $800 million letter of credit 
facility.  This facility is required to provide security with 
respect to aggregate excess of loss reinsurance obligations under 
contracts with certain of the former Talegen units and TRG.

XFSI may also be required, under certain circumstances, to 
purchase over time additional redeemable preferred shares of 
Ridge Re, up to a maximum of $301 million. 

Net Investment in Insurance

The net investment in Insurance at March 31, 1999 totaled $595 
million compared with a balance of $513 million at December 31, 
1998.  The increase in 1999 is due to contractual payments to 
Ridge Re for annual premium installments and associated finance 
charges, payment for the settlement of litigation related to the 
sale of one of the former Talegen units and interest on the 
assigned insurance debt.


Other Financial Services

The net investment in Other Financial Services at March 31, 1999 
was $138 million compared with $132 million at December 31, 1998. 
Debt associated with these assets totaled $50 million at March 
31, 1999 and December 31, 1998.  The increase in the investment 
is primarily due to payment related to the settlement of certain 
litigation and interest on the assigned debt. 

On June 1, 1995, XFSI completed the sale of Xerox Financial 
Services Life Insurance Company and related companies (Xerox 
Life).  In connection with the transaction, OakRe Life Insurance 
Company (OakRe), a wholly owned XFSI subsidiary, has assumed 
responsibility, via Coinsurance Agreements, for existing Single 
Premium Deferred Annuity (SPDA) policies issued by Xerox Life.  
The Coinsurance Agreements include a provision for the assumption 
(at their election) by the purchaser's companies, of all of the 
SPDA policies at the end of their current rate reset periods.  A 
Novation Agreement with an affiliate of the new owner provides 
for the assumption of the liability under the Coinsurance 
Agreements for any SPDA policies not so assumed.

As a result of the Coinsurance Agreements, at March 31, 1999, 
OakRe retained approximately $0.7 billion of investment portfolio 
assets (transferred from Xerox Life) and liabilities related to 
the reinsured SPDA policies.  Interest rates on these policies 
are fixed and were established upon issuance of the respective 
policies.  Substantially all of these policies will reach their 
rate reset periods through the year 2000 and will be assumed 
under the Agreements as described above.  Xerox Life's portfolio 
was designed to recognize that policy renewals extended liability 
"maturities," thereby permitting investments with average 
duration somewhat beyond the rate reset periods.  OakRe's 
practice is to selectively improve this match over time as market 
conditions allow.

In connection with the aforementioned sale, XFSI established a 
$500 million letter of credit and line of credit with a group of 
banks to support OakRe's coinsurance obligations.  The term of 
this letter of credit is five years and it is unused and 
available at March 31, 1999.  Upon a drawing under the letter of 
credit, XFSI has the option to cover the drawing in cash or to 
draw upon the credit line.

Third Party Financing and Real Estate

Third Party Financing and Real Estate assets at March 31, 1999 
and December 31, 1998 totaled $123 million and $250 million, 
respectively.  The reduction primarily relates to the sale of six 
of our remaining eight financing leases as well as other asset 
sales and runoff activity that were consistent with the amounts 
contemplated in the formal disposal plan.  Debt associated with 
these assets totaled $44 million and $86 million at March 31, 
1999 and December 31, 1998, respectively.

Non-Financing Operations

The following table summarizes document processing non-financing 
operations cash generation and usage for the three months ended 
March 31, 1999 and 1998 (in millions):

                                         1999        1998

*  Includes rental equipment depreciation of $105 and $95 million 
in first quarter 1999 and 1998, respectively


Non-financing operations' cash usage during the first three 
months of 1999 totaled $987 million or $30 million less than in 
the first three months of 1998.   Higher net income and non-cash 
charges, and lower inventory growth, were partially offset by 
higher capital spending, net changes in other assets and 
liabilities such as prepaid expenses, accounts payable and 
accrued compensation, and cash charges against the 1998 
restructuring reserve.  


Financing Businesses

Customer financing-related debt declined by $505 million during 
the first three months of 1999 or $406 more than in first quarter 
1998.  The decline is more than due to a reallocation to non 
financing operations of a portion of Xerox do Brasil's U.S. 
dollar denominated debt used to fund customer finance receivables 
denominated in Brazilian currency.  The reallocation is in line 
with our 8:1 debt to equity guideline for financing operations.

Debt related to discontinued third party financing and real 
estate activities, which is included in financing business debt, 
totaled $44 million at March 31, 1999 or $42 million less than at 
year end 1998.  Asset sales and portfolio run-off account for the 
first quarter reduction.  Third party financing and real estate 
debt was $119 at March 31, 1998 essentially unchanged from the 
year end 1997 level.  

Funding Plans for 1999

During the first quarter of 1999, the company filed a new $4 
billion shelf registration statement with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission.  This shelf facility is available to Xerox 
Corporation, Xerox Credit Corporation and Xerox Capital (Europe) 
plc.  In May 1999, Xerox Capital (Europe) plc issued a total of 
$1 billion of 3 and 5 year debt under this shelf facility.

Risk Management

Xerox is typical of multinational corporations because it is 
exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange 
rates and interest rates that could affect our results of 
operations and financial condition. 

We have entered into certain financial instruments to manage 
interest rate and foreign currency exposures. These instruments 
are held solely for hedging purposes and include interest rate 
swap agreements, forward exchange contracts and foreign currency 
swap agreements. We do not enter into derivative instrument 
transactions for trading purposes and employ long-standing 
policies prescribing that derivative instruments are only to be 
used to achieve a set of very limited objectives. 

Currency derivatives are primarily arranged in conjunction with 
underlying transactions that give rise to foreign currency-
denominated payables and receivables. For example, an option to 
buy foreign currency to settle the importation of goods from 
foreign suppliers, or a forward exchange contract to fix the 
dollar value of a foreign currency-denominated loan. 


With regard to interest rate hedging, virtually all customer-
financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. Therefore, within 
industrialized economies, we "lock in" an interest rate spread by 
arranging fixed-rate liabilities with similar maturities as the 
underlying assets and fund the assets with liabilities in the 
same currency, except in developing economies where capital 
market access to these financial instruments is impracticable.  
We refer to the effect of these conservative practices as "match 
funding" customer financing assets. This practice effectively 
eliminates the risk of a major decline in interest margins during 
a period of rising interest rates. Conversely, this practice 
effectively eliminates the opportunity to materially increase 
margins when interest rates are declining. 

Pay fixed-rate and receive variable-rate swaps are typically used 
in place of more expensive fixed-rate debt. Additionally, pay 
variable-rate and receive fixed-rate swaps are used from time to 
time to transform longer-term fixed-rate debt into variable rate 
obligations. The transactions performed within each of these 
categories enable more cost-effective management of interest rate 
exposures. The potential risk attendant to this strategy is the 
non-performance of the swap counterparty. We address this risk by 
arranging swaps with a diverse group of strong-credit 
counterparties, regularly monitoring their credit ratings and 
determining the replacement cost, if any, of existing 
transactions. 


Our currency and interest rate hedging are typically unaffected 
by changes in market conditions as forward contracts, options and 
swaps are normally held to maturity consistent with our objective 
to lock in currency rates and interest rate spreads on the 
underlying transactions.

(1) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on the 
    Company's continuing operations by dividing total earnings available for 
    fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest and preferred stock
    dividends of subsidiaries, by total fixed charges.  Fixed charges consist
    of interest, including capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends
    of subsidiaries, and one-third of rent expense as representative of the
    interest portion of rentals.  Debt has been assigned to discontinued
    operations based on historical levels assigned to the businesses when
    they were continuing operations, adjusted for subsequent paydowns.
    Discontinued operations consist of the Company's Insurance, Other
    Financial Services, and Third Party Financing and Real Estate businesses.

(2) The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of 
    the Company's finance subsidiaries, which primarily finance Xerox 
    equipment.  Financing businesses are more highly leveraged and,
    therefore, tend to operate at lower earnings to fixed charges ratio 
    levels than do non-financial businesses.

*   Excluding the effects of the charges recorded in connection with the 1998 
    restructuring plan, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would be 
    3.55.

the place, date and hour of the meeting.  Notice of a Special Meeting shall 
state the purpose or purposes for which it is being called and shall also 
indicate that it is being issued by or at the direction of the person or persons
calling the meeting.  If, at any meeting, action is proposed to be taken which 
would, if taken, entitle shareholders, ful-filling the requirements of Section 
623 of the Business Corporation Law to receive payment for their shares, the 
notice of such meeting shall include a statement of that purpose and to that 
effect.

(b)A copy of the notice of any meeting shall be given, personally or by mail, 
not less than ten nor more than sixty days before the date of the meeting, to 
each shareholder entitled to vote at such meeting.  If mailed, such notice is 
given when de-posited in the United States mail, with postage thereon prepaid, 
directed to the share-holder at his address as it appears on the record of 
shareholders, or, if he shall have filed with the Secretary a written request 
that notices to him be mailed to some other address, then directed to him at 
such other address.

(c)Notice of meeting need not be given to any shareholder who submits a signed 
waiver of notice, in person or by proxy, whether before or after the meeting.  
The attendance of any shareholder at a meeting, in person or by proxy, without 
pro-testing prior to the conclusion of the meeting the lack of notice of such 
meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice by him.

SECTION 5.   Quorum and Adjourned Meetings:

(a)At any Annual or Special Meeting the holders of a majority of the votes of 
shares entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of any business, provided that when a specified 
item of business is required to be voted on by a class or series, voting as a 
class, the holders of a majority of the votes of shares of such class or series 
shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of such specified item of 
business.  When a quorum is once present to organize a meeting, it is not broken
by the subsequent withdrawal of any shareholders.

(b)Despite the absence of a quorum, the shareholders present may adjourn the 
meeting to another time and place, and it shall not be necessary to give any 
notice of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is 
adjourned are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At 
the adjourned meeting any business may be transacted that might have been 
transacted on the original date of the meeting.  If after the adjournment, 
however, the Board of Directors fixes a new record date for the adjourned 
meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each shareholder on
the new record date entitled to notice under Section 4 of this Article I of the 
By-Laws.

SECTION 6.   Nominations and Business at Meetings

At any annual meeting of shareholders, only persons who are nominated or 
business which is proposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this 
Section 6 shall be eligible for election as Directors or considered for action 
by shareholders.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors 
of the Company may be made or business proposed at a meeting of shareholders (i)
by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any shareholder of 
the Company entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice and 
other procedures set forth in this Section 6.  Such nominations or business 
proposals, other than those made by or at the direction of the Board of 
Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary 
of the Company and such business proposals must, under applicable law, be a 
proper matter for shareholder action.  To be timely, a shareholder's notice 
shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices 
of the Company not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days in advance of the 
date which is the anniversary of the date the Company's proxy statement was 
released to security holders in connection with the previous year's annual 
meeting or if the date of the applicable annual meeting has been changed by more
than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy
statement, not less than 90 days before the date of the applicable annual 
meeting.

Such shareholder's notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom such 
shareholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a Director, all 
information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in 
solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in
each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
as amended (including such person's writ-ten consent to being named in the proxy
statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected); (b) as to any 
other business that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a 
brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual 
meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting and any 
material interest in such business of such person on whose behalf such proposal 
is made; and (c) as to the shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial 
owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (i) the name 
and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the Company's books and (ii) 
the class and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by 
such shareholder.  No person shall be eligible for election as a Director of the
Company and no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of shareholders
unless nominated or proposed in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 6.  The Chairman of the meeting may, if the facts warrant, determine and
declare to the meeting that a nomination or proposal was not made in accordance 
with the provisions of this Section 6 and, if he should so determine, he shall 
so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination or proposal shall be 
disregarded.

SECTION 7.   Organization:   At every meeting of the shareholders, the Chairman 
of the Board, or in his absence, the President, or in his absence, a Vice 
Chairman, or in the absence of such officers, an Executive Vice President 
designated by the Chairman of the Board, or in the absence of such officers, a 
person selected by the meeting, shall act as chairman of the meeting.  The 
Secretary or, in his absence, an Assistant Secretary shall act as secretary of 
the meeting, and in the absence of both the Secretary and an Assistant 
Secretary, a per-son selected by the meeting shall act as secretary of the 
meeting. 

SECTION 8.   Voting:

(a)Whenever any corporate action, other than the election of Directors, is to be
taken by vote of the shareholders, it shall, except as otherwise required by law
or by the Certificate of Incorporation be authorized by a majority of the votes 
cast in favor of or against such action at a meeting of shareholders by the 
holders of shares entitled to vote thereon.  An abstention shall not constitute 
a vote cast.

(b)Directors shall, except as otherwise required by law, be elected by a 
plurality of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders by holders of shares 
entitled to vote in the election.  [; provided, however, a nomination shall be 
accepted, and votes cast for a nominee shall be counted by the inspectors of 
election, only if the Secretary of the Company has received at least twenty-four
hours prior to the meeting a statement over the signature of the nominee that he
consents to being a nominee and, if elected, intends to serve as a Director.] * 
 SECTION 9.   Qualification of Voters:

(a)Every shareholder of record of Common Stock and Series B Convertible 
Preferred Stock of the Company shall be entitled at every meeting of such share-
holders to one vote for every share of Common Stock and Series B Convertible 
Preferred Stock, respectively, standing in his name on the record of 
shareholders.

(b)Shares of stock belonging to the Company and shares held by another domestic 
or foreign corporation of any type or kind, if a majority of the shares entitled
to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held by the 
Company, shall not be shares entitled to vote or to be counted in determining 
the total number of out-standing shares.

(c)Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator, commit-tee,
or other fiduciary, except a trustee, may be voted by him, either in person or 
by proxy, without transfer of such shares into his name.  Shares held by a 
trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, only after the shares
have been transferred into his name as trustee or into the name of his nominee. 

(d)Shares standing in the name of another domestic or foreign corporation of any
type or kind may be voted by such officer, agent or proxy as the By-Laws of such
corporation may provide, or in the absence of such provision, as the Board of 
Directors of such corporation may provide.

SECTION 10.   Proxies:

(a)Every shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to ex-
press consent or dissent without a meeting may authorize another person or 
persons to act for him by proxy.

(b)No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven months from the date 
thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Every proxy shall be revocable 
at the pleasure of the shareholder executing it, except as otherwise provided by
law.

(c)The authority of the holder of a proxy to act shall not be revoked by the in-
competence or death of the shareholder who executed the proxy unless, before the
authority is exercised, written notice of an adjudication of such incompetence 
or of such death is received by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary.

(d)Without limiting the manner in which a shareholder may authorize another per-
son or persons to act for him as proxy pursuant to paragraph (a) of this 
Section, the following shall constitute a valid means by which a shareholder may
grant such authority:

(1)A shareholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to 
act for him as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the share-holder or the 
shareholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such 
writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any 
reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
(2)A shareholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the 
shareholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a tele-
gram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person who will
be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support ser-
vice organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the 
holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that such telegram, 
cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be
submitted with information from which it can be reasonably determined that the 
telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was authorized by the 
shareholder.  If it is determined that such telegrams, cablegrams or other elec-
tronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors shall specify the nature of the 
in-formation upon which they relied.

(e)Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the 
writing or transmission created pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and 
all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used, 
provided that such copy, facsimile, telecommunication or other reproduction 
shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

SECTION 11.   Inspectors of Election: 

(a)The Board of Directors, in advance of any shareholders' meeting, shall 
appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting or any adjournment thereof.
The Board of Directors may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors
to re-place any inspector who fails to act.  If no inspector or alternate has 
been appointed, or if such persons are unable to act at a meeting of 
shareholders, the person presiding at a shareholders' meeting shall appoint one 
or more inspectors.  Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge of his 
duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to exe-cute the duties of 
inspector at such meeting with strict impartiality and according to the best of 
his ability.

(b)The inspectors shall determine the number of shares outstanding and the 
voting power of each, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a 
quo-rum, the validity and effect of proxies, and shall receive votes, ballots or
consents, hear and determine all challenges and questions arising in connection 
with the right to vote, count and tabulate all votes, ballots or consents, 
determine the result, and do such acts as are proper to conduct the election or 
vote with fairness to all shareholders.  On re-quest of the person presiding at 
the meeting or any shareholder entitled to vote thereat, the inspectors shall 
make a report in writing of any challenge, question or matter determined by them
and execute a certificate of any fact found by them.  Any report or certificate 
made by them shall be prima facie evidence of the facts stated and of the vote 
as certified by them.

SECTION 12.   List of Shareholders at Meetings:   A list of share-holders as of 
the record date, certified by the Secretary or by the transfer agent, shall be 
produced at any meeting of shareholders upon the request thereat or prior 
thereto of any share-holder.  If the right to vote at any meeting is challenged,
the inspectors of election, or person presiding thereat shall require such list 
of shareholders to be produced as evidence of the right of the persons 
challenged to vote at such meeting, and all persons who appear from such list to
be shareholders entitled to vote thereat may vote at such meeting.

SECTION 1.   Power of Board and Qualification of Directors:   The business of 
the Company shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors, each
of whom shall be at least eighteen years of age.

SECTION 2.   Number, Term of Office and Classification:

(a)The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than five nor more 
than twenty-one members.  The number of Directors shall be determined from time
to time by resolution of a majority of the entire Board of Directors then in 
office, provided that no decrease in the number of Directors shall shorten the
term of any incumbent Director.  At each Annual Meeting of shareholders 
Directors shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting.

(b)If and whenever six full quarter-yearly dividends (whether or not 
consecutive) payable on the Cumulative Preferred Stock of any series shall be in
arrears, in whole or in part, the number of Directors then constituting the 
Board of Directors shall be increased by two and the holders of the Cumulative
Preferred Stock, voting separately as a class, regardless of series, shall be 
entitled to elect the two additional Directors at any annual meeting of 
shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof, or at a special meeting
of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock called as hereinafter provided.
Whenever all arrears in dividends on the Cumulative Preferred Stock then 
outstanding shall have been paid and dividends thereon for the current quarter-
yearly dividend period shall have been paid or declared and set apart for 
payment, then the right of the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock to 
elect such additional two Directors shall cease (but subject always to the same
provisions for the vesting of such voting rights in the case of any similar 
future arrearages in dividends), and the terms of office of all persons elected
as Directors by the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock shall forthwith 
terminate and the number of the Board of Directors shall be reduced accordingly.
At any time after such voting power shall have been so vested in the Cumulative 
Preferred Stock, the Secretary of the Company may, and upon the written request 
of any holder of the Cumulative Preferred Stock (addressed to the Secretary at 
the principal office of the Company) shall, call a special meeting of the 
holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock for the election of the two Directors 
to be elected by them as herein provided, such call to be made by notice similar
to that provided in the By-Laws for a special meeting of the shareholders or as 
required by law.  If any such special meeting required to be called as above 
provided shall not be called by the Secretary within twenty days after receipt 
of any such request, then any holder of Cumulative Preferred Stock may call such
meeting, upon the notice above provided, and for that purpose shall have access 
to the stock books of the Company.  The Directors elected at any such special 
meeting shall hold office until the next annual meeting of the shareholders or 
special meeting held in place thereof.  In case any vacancy shall occur among 
the Directors elected by the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock, a 
successor shall be elected to serve until the next annual meeting of the 
shareholders or special meeting held in place thereof by the then remaining
 Director elected by the holders of the Cumulative Preferred Stock or the 
successor of such remaining Director.

than a quorum exists.  A Director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office 
until the next annual meeting.

such place or places within or without the State of New York as the Board of

commencement, the lack of notice to him.

SECTION 11.   Quorum and Manner of Acting:

(a)If the number of Directors is twelve or more, seven Directors shall 
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business or any specified item of 
business.  If the number of Directors is less than twelve, a majority of the 
entire Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum.

Directors, or between the Company and any other corporation, firm, association 
or other entity in which one or more of its Directors are directors or officers,
or are financially interested, shall be either void or voidable for this reason 
alone or by reason alone that such Director or Directors are present at the 
meeting of the Board of Directors, or of a committee thereof, which approves 
such contract or transaction, or that his or their votes are counted for such 
purpose, provided that the parties to the contract or transaction establish 
affirmatively that it was fair and reasonable as to the Company at the time it 
was approved by the Board, a committee, or the shareholders.

(b)Any such contract or transaction may not be avoided by the Company for the 
reasons set forth in (a) if

(1)the material facts as to such Director's interest in such contract or 
transaction and as to any such common directorship, officership or financial 
interest are disclosed in good faith or known to the Board or committee, and the
Board or committee approves such contract or transaction by a vote sufficient 
for such purpose without counting the vote of such interested Director or, if 
the votes of the disinterested Directors are insufficient for such purpose, by 
unanimous vote of the disinterested Directors (although common or interested 
Directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of
the Board or of a committee which approves such contract or transactions), or

(2)the material facts as to such Director's interest in such contract or 
transaction and as to any such common directorship, officership or financial 
interest are disclosed in good faith or known to the shareholders entitled to 
vote thereon, and such contract or transaction is approved by vote of such 
shareholders.

guarantee the obligation of a Director of the Company unless the particular loan
or guarantee is approved by the shareholders, with the holders of a majority of

By-Laws otherwise provided, may authorize any officer or officers, agent, or 
agents, in the name of and on behalf of the Company to enter into any contract 
or exe-cute and deliver any instrument, and such authority may be general or 
confined to specific instances; but, unless so authorized by the Board of 
Directors, or expressly authorized by these By-Laws, no officer, agent or

ARTICLE VI

STOCKS AND DIVIDENDS

SECTION 1.   Shares of Stock:   Shares of stock of the Company shall be rep-
resented by certificates except to the extent that the Board of Directors of the
Company shall provide by resolution that some or all of any or all classes and 
series of the Company's shares shall be uncertificated shares, provided that 
such resolution shall not  apply to shares represented by a certificate until 
such certificate is surrendered to the Company. Except as otherwise expressly 
provided by law, the rights and obligations of holders of uncertificated shares 
and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates representing 
shares of the same class and series shall be identical. 

SECTION 2.  Certificates For Shares.  To the extent that shares of stock of the 
Company are to be represented by certificates, the certificates  therefor shall 
be in such form as shall be approved by the Board of Directors.  The 
certificates of stock shall be numbered in order of their issue, shall be signed
by the Chairman of the Board, the President, a Vice Chairman or a Vice 
President, and the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, or the Treasurer or an 
Assistant Treasurer.  The signature of the officers upon a certificate may be 
facsimiles if the certificate is countersigned by a transfer agent or regis-
tered by a registrar other than the Company itself or its employee.  In case any
officer who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a 
certificate shall have ceased to be such officer before such certificate is 
issued, it may be issued by the Company with the same effect as if he were an 
officer at the date of issue.

SECTION 3.   Transfer of Stock:   Transfers of stock of the Company shall be 
made only on the books of the Company by the holder thereof, or by his duly 
authorized attorney, on surrender of the certificate or certificates for stock 
represented by certificates, properly endorsed, or in the case of shares of 
stock not represented by certificates, on delivery to the Company of proper 
transfer instructions. Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer 
of uncertificated stock, the Company shall send to the registered owner thereof 
a written notice containing the information required to be set forth or stated 
on certificates pursuant to the Business Corporation Law of the State of New 
York. Every certificate surrendered to the Company shall be marked "Canceled", 
with the date of cancellation, and no new certificate shall be issued in 
exchange there-for until the old certificate has been surrendered and canceled.
A person in whose name stock of the Company stands on the books of the Company 
shall be deemed the owner thereof as regards the Company; provided that, 
whenever any transfer of stock shall be made for collateral security, and not 
absolutely, such fact, if known to the Secretary of the Company, or to its 
transfer agent shall be so expressed in the entry of the transfer.  No transfer
of stock shall be valid as against the Company, or its share-holders for any 
purpose, until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the Company as
specified in these By-Laws by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.

SECTION 4.   Transfer and Registry Agents:   The Company may, from time to time,
maintain one or more transfer offices or agencies and/or registry offices at 
such place or places as may be determined from time to time by the Board of 
Directors; and the Board of Directors may, from time to time, define the duties 
of such transfer agents and registrars and make such rules and regulations as it
may deem expedient, not in-consistent with these By-Laws, concerning the issue, 
transfer and registration of certificates for stock or uncertificated stock of 
the Company.

SECTION 5.   Lost, Destroyed and Mutilated Certificates:   The holder of any 
certificated stock of the Company shall immediately notify the Company of any 
loss, destruction or mutilation of the certificate therefor.  The Company may 
issue a new certificate or uncertificated stock in place of the lost or 
destroyed certificate, but as a condition to such issue, the holder of such 
certificate must make satisfactory proof of the loss or destruction thereof, and
must give to the Company a bond of indemnity in form and amount and with one or 
more sureties satisfactory to the Treasurer, the Secretary or any Assistant 
Treasurer or Assistant Secretary.  Such bond of indemnity shall also name as 
obligee each of the transfer agents and registrars for the stock the certificate
for which has been lost or destroyed.

SECTION 6.   Record Dates for Certain Purposes:   The Board of Directors of the 
Company shall fix a day and hour not more than sixty days preceding the date of 
any meeting of shareholders, or the date for payment of any cash or stock 
dividend, or the date for the allotment of any rights of subscription, or the 
date when any change or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into 
effect, as a record date for the determination of the shareholders entitled to 
notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting and any adjournment thereof, or 
entitled to receive payment of any such dividend, or entitled to receive any 
such allotment of rights of subscription, or entitled to exercise rights in 
respect of any such change, conversion or exchange of capital stock, and in such
case, such shareholders and only such shareholders as shall be shareholders of 
record on the day and hour so fixed shall be entitled to such notice of, and to 
vote at, such meeting or any adjournment thereof, or to receive payment of such 
dividend, or to receive such allotment of rights of subscription, or to exercise
rights in connection with such change or conversion or exchange of capital 
stock, as the case may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the 
books of the Company after such day and hour fixed as aforesaid.

SECTION 7.   Dividends and Surplus:   Subject to the limitations prescribed by 
law, the Board of Directors (1) may declare dividends on the stock of the 
Company whenever and in such amounts as, in its opinion, the condition of the 
affairs of the Company shall render it advisable, (2) may use and apply, in its 
discretion, any part or all of the surplus of the Company in purchasing or 
acquiring any of the shares of stock of the Company, and (3) may set aside from 
time to time out of such surplus or net profits such sum or sums as it in its 
absolute discretion, may think proper as a reserve fund to meet contingencies or
for equalizing dividends, or for the purpose of maintaining or increasing the 
property or business of the Company, or for any other purpose it may think 
conducive to the best interest of the Company.

judgment in its favor or by or in the right of any other corporation of any type

proceeding, consistent with the provisions of applicable law.  In addition to 
the foregoing, the Company is authorized to extend rights to indemnification and
