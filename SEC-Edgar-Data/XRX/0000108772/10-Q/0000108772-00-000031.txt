Forward-Looking Statements

From time to time the Registrant (or the "Company") and its representatives
may provide information, whether orally or in writing, which are deemed to be
"forward-looking" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995 ("Litigation Reform Act").  These forward-looking
statements and other information relating to the Company are based on the
beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information currently
available to management.

The words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "will," and
similar expressions, as they relate to the Company or the Company's
management, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Such
statements reflect the current views of the Registrant with respect to future
events and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should
underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially
from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected.
The Registrant does not intend to update these forward-looking statements.

In accordance with the provisions of the Litigation Reform Act we are making
investors aware that such "forward-looking" statements, because they relate to
future events, are by their very nature subject to many important factors
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in
the "forward-looking" statements.  Such factors include but are not limited to
the following:

Competition - the Registrant operates in an environment of significant
competition, driven by rapid technological advances and the demands of
customers to become more efficient.  There are a number of companies worldwide
with significant financial resources which compete with the Registrant to
provide document processing products and services in each of the markets
served by the Registrant, some of whom operate on a global basis.  The
Registrant's success in its future performance is largely dependent upon its
ability to compete successfully in its currently-served markets and to expand
into additional market segments.

Transition to Digital - presently black and white light-lens copiers represent
approximately 25% of the Registrant's revenues.  This segment of the general
office market is mature with anticipated declining industry revenues as the
market transitions to digital technology.  Some of the Registrant's new
digital products replace or compete with the Registrant's current light-lens
equipment.  Changes in the mix of products from light-lens to digital, and the
pace of that change as well as competitive developments could cause actual
results to vary from those expected.

Pricing - the Registrant's ability to succeed is dependent upon its ability to
obtain adequate pricing for its products and services which provide a
reasonable return to shareholders.  Depending on competitive market factors,
future prices the Registrant can obtain for its products and services may vary
from historical levels. In addition, pricing actions to offset currency
devaluations may not prove sufficient to offset further devaluations or may
not hold in the face of customer resistance and/or competition.

Financing Business - a portion of the Registrant's profits arise from the
financing of its customers' purchases of the Registrant's equipment.  On
average, 75 to 80 percent of equipment sales are financed through the
Registrant. The Registrant's ability to provide such financing at competitive
rates and realize profitable spreads is highly dependent upon its own costs of
borrowing which, in turn, depend upon its credit ratings.  There is no
assurance that the company's credit ratings can be maintained and/or access to
the credit markets can be assured. A downgrade or lowering in such ratings
could restrict access to the credit markets, would reduce the profitability of
such financing business, and/or reduce the volume of financing business done.
In connection with our recently announced turnaround plan, the Company is
exploring alternatives to providing financing to our customers using third
parties.

Productivity - the Registrant's ability to sustain and improve its profit
margins is largely dependent on its ability to maintain an efficient, cost-
effective operation.  Productivity improvements through process reengineering,
design efficiency and supplier cost improvements are required to offset labor
cost inflation and potential materials cost changes and competitive price
pressures.  The Registrant's productivity will also be affected by the results
of the Company's recently announced turnaround plan. The Registrant is in the
process of finalizing plans designed to reduce costs by $1.0 billion annually.

International Operations - the Registrant derives approximately half its
revenue from operations outside of the United States.  In addition, the
Registrant manufactures many of its products and/or their components outside
the United States.  The Registrant's future revenue, cost and profit results
could be affected by a number of factors, including changes in foreign
currency exchange rates, changes in economic conditions from country to
country, changes in a country's political conditions, trade protection
measures, licensing requirements and local tax issues.

New Products/Research and Development - the process of developing new high
technology products and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain.  It
requires accurate anticipation of customers' changing needs and emerging
technological trends.  The Registrant must then make long-term investments and
commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will
eventually result in products that achieve customer acceptance and generate
the revenues required to provide anticipated returns from these investments.

Restructuring - the Registrant's ability to ultimately reduce pre-tax annual
expenditures by approximately $1.4 billion, before reinvestments, is dependent
upon its ability to successfully implement the 1998 and 2000 restructuring
programs including the elimination of 14,200 net jobs worldwide (9,000 under
1998 program, 5,200 under 2000 program), the closing and consolidation of
facilities and the successful implementation of process and systems changes.

Revenue Growth - the Registrant's ability to attain a consistent trend of
revenue growth over the intermediate to longer term is largely dependent upon
expansion of its equipment sales worldwide which in turn are dependent upon
the ability to finance internally or through a third party the customer's
purchases of the Registrant's products.  The ability to achieve equipment
sales growth is subject to the successful implementation of our initiatives to
provide industry-oriented global solutions for major customers and expansion
of our distribution channels in the face of global competition and pricing
pressures.  Our inability to attain a consistent trend of revenue growth could
materially affect the trend of our actual results.

Liquidity - the Registrant's liquidity is currently provided through its own
cash generation from operations, various financing strategies, including
securitizations, and utilization of its $7 billion Revolving Credit Agreement
with a large group of banks which is available through October, 2002.  The
Registrant has embarked upon a process of selling certain assets with the
objective of generating proceeds for the purpose of retiring outstanding debt.
Thus, the Registrant's liquidity is dependent upon its ability to successfully
generate positive cash flow from operations, continuation of securitizations
and other financing alternatives, and completion of asset sales

1.  The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements
presented herein have been prepared by Xerox Corporation ("the
Company") in accordance with the accounting policies described in
its 1999 Annual Report to Shareholders and should be read in
conjunction with the notes thereto.

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary for a fair
statement of operating results for the interim periods presented
have been made.

Prior years' financial statements have been restated to reflect
certain reclassifications to conform with the 2000 presentation.
The impact of these changes is not material and did not affect
net income.

References herein to "we" or "our" refer to Xerox and
consolidated subsidiaries unless the context specifically
requires otherwise.

2. Accounts receivable Sale Agreement

 In September 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to sell,
on an ongoing basis, a defined pool of accounts receivable to a
wholly-owned qualifying bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity.
The special purpose entity, in turn, sells participating
interests in such accounts receivable to financial institutions
up to a maximum amount of $400 million.  Under the terms of the
agreement, new receivables are added to the pool as collections
reduce previously sold accounts receivable.  The Company
continues to service these receivables on behalf of the special
purpose entity and receives a servicing fee.  As of September 30,
2000, $315 million in proceeds were received from the
securitization of accounts receivable under this agreement.  The
proceeds were used to reduce outstanding debt and are reflected
as an operating cash flow in the consolidated statement of cash
flows.  The earnings impact related to the receivables sold and
securitized under this agreement was not material.

3.  Finance receivable Secured Borrowing:

In September 2000, the Company transferred $457 million of
finance receivables to a wholly-owned qualifying bankruptcy-
remote special purpose entity for cash proceeds of $411 million.
The difference of $46 million between the amount transferred and
the proceeds represents the Company's retained interest in these
finance receivables.  The Company and the financial institutions
which provided the funding for the special purpose entity's
payment for the transfer of the receivables, through the purchase
of participating interests, intend the transfer to be a "true
sale at law" and have received an opinion to that effect from the
Company's outside legal counsel.  However, the agreement includes
a repurchase option and therefore the proceeds of $411 million
received from the financial institutions were accounted for as a
secured borrowing in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No.
125 "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
and Extinguishments of Liabilities".  The balance of the
receivables transferred was $457 million at September 30, 2000
and continues to be included in Finance receivables, net in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

5.  On March 31, 2000, we announced details of a worldwide
restructuring program designed to enhance shareholder value, spur
growth and strengthen the company's competitive position in the
digital marketplace primarily through cost and expense
reductions. In connection with this program, in the first quarter
of 2000 we recorded a pre-tax provision of $625 million ($444
million after taxes and including our $18 million share of a
restructuring charge recorded by Fuji Xerox, an unconsolidated
affiliate).  The $625 million pre-tax charge includes severance
costs related to the elimination of 5,200 positions worldwide.
Approximately 65 percent of the positions eliminated are in the
U.S., 20 percent are in Europe, and the remainder are
predominantly in Latin America. The employment reductions are
wide-ranging, impacting all levels and business groups.  None of
the reductions will reduce sales coverage or affect direct
research and development.  The charge also includes $71 million
related to facility closings and other asset write-offs and $119
million for inventory charges, which were recorded as a component
of cost of revenues. For facility fixed assets classified as
assets to be disposed of, the impairment loss recognized is based
on the fair value less cost to sell, with fair value based on
estimates of existing market prices for similar assets. The
inventory charges relate primarily to the consolidation of
distribution centers and warehouses and the exit from certain
product lines. The $625 million pre-tax charge was reduced by $2
million in the second quarter due to a change in estimate.

The restructuring is expected to be completed in early 2001. Key
initiatives of the restructuring, which will result in charges
for severance and exit activities, include the following:

1)  Sharpening the company's focus on cost, quality and delivery
    in manufacturing by reducing the production infrastructure
    and moving certain product lines to regions where they are in
    the greatest customer demand.
2)  Driving greater efficiency in logistics and supply chain
    operations through the consolidation of distribution centers
    and warehouses, reducing costs and improving inventory turns.
3)  Enhancing customer service delivery by deploying technology
    and executing process changes to reduce costs.
4)  Implementing an average 10 percent reduction in the number of
    middle and upper managers across the various Xerox businesses
    in the United States, with similar reductions in other
    geographic areas.
5)  Eliminating redundancies in support functions by moving to a
    shared service model for marketing, human resources and
    finance.
6)  Outsourcing work in areas not related to the company's core
    business operations and where there is economic advantage.
7)  Accelerating the integration of business functions in General
    Markets Operations to achieve benchmark expenses and
    processes for indirect sales channels.
8)  Implementing a wide-ranging series of initiatives across
    Developing Markets Operations (DMO) geographies to improve
    productivity and cost levels.
9)  Leveraging Web-based technology to simplify and streamline
    processes across internal business operations, and extending
    to vendor and customer relationships.

The following table summarizes the status of the restructuring
reserve (in millions):

/1/ Includes $2 million reduction recorded in second quarter 2000.
/2/ Of this amount, $265 is included in Other current liabilities.

Included in the charge of $49 million is $32 million of various
contractual commitments, other than facility occupancy leases,
that will be terminated early as a result of the restructuring.
The commitments include cancellation of supply contracts and
outsourced vendor contracts. Also included are approximately $17
million of charges related to lease cancellation costs which are
mainly for the consolidation of distribution centers and
warehouses located primarily in the U.S.

Included in the charge of $71 million was: $44 million for
machinery and tooling for products that were discontinued or
alternatively sourced; $7 million for leasehold improvements at
facilities that will be closed; and $20 million of sundry surplus
assets, individually insignificant, from various parts of our
business.  These assets were primarily located in the U.S. and
the related product lines generated an immaterial amount of
revenue.

Approximately $100 million of the $119 million of inventory
charges related to excess inventory in many product lines created
by the consolidation of distribution centers and warehouses.  The
remainder was related to the exit from certain product lines,
including approximately $15 million of electrostatic machines in
our wide format printing business due to a transition to ink jet
products.

As of September 30, 2000, approximately 1,200 employees have left
the Company under the 2000 restructuring program. There have been
no material changes to the program since its announcement, and
the remaining reserve relates to cash expenditures to be incurred
primarily during the remainder of 2000 and early 2001.


6. In April 1998, in connection with a restructuring program the
Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $1,644 million.  The charge
was composed of:


                  Cash Charges:
Severance and related costs          $1,017
Lease cancellation and other costs      198
   Sub-total                          1,215

                  Non-cash Charges:
Asset impairment                       316
Inventory charges                      113
   Sub-total                           429

Total                               $1,644



Included in the cash charges were $91 million and $107 million of
lease cancellation costs and of various other contractual
decommitments, respectively.  These premises were vacated at
various dates in 1998 and 1999, and by the end of 1999 the
majority of the premises were vacated.  The remaining facilities
are expected to be vacated by early 2001.  Delays in vacating
these facilities were primarily due to: delays in terminating
employees in European countries as a result of local labor laws,
strong unions and workers councils and socialist governments in
some countries; and delays in implementing key system enablers in
Europe. The other costs totaling $107 million are comprised of
various contractual decommitments, other than facility occupancy
leases, that are being terminated early as a result of the
restructuring.  The decommitments, related to information
management contracts and outsourced vendor contracts, are in the
form of either penalties associated with the early termination of
the contract or contractual obligations for which we will not
generate future economic benefit.

The non-cash portion of this restructuring program included $316
million of asset impairments and $113 million of inventory
charges recorded as cost of revenues.  The $316 million asset
charge included $156 million for facilities abandonment and $160
million for other asset write-offs. The facilities abandonment
charge affects assets located in numerous locations in the U.S.
and Europe and is comprised of the following:  $54 million
primarily for machinery and tooling for light-lens products that
have been discontinued as a result of the restructuring; $40
million for a major training facility to be disposed as training
will transition to more localized processes and $62 million for
other facilities and leasehold improvements at locations to be
abandoned as part of the restructuring.  Other assets written off
are primarily comprised of capitalized internal use software and
information management infrastructure totaling $124 million that
are being abandoned as part of our closed facilities or as a
result of the overhauling of internal processes.  The remainder
of $36 million is comprised of sundry surplus assets,
individually insignificant, from various parts of our business.

In general, the aforementioned assets were either abandoned or
scrapped and therefore written down to zero and removed from
service at the time the restructuring charge was recorded.  These
assets were not previously considered impaired, as they were
expected to generate cash flow sufficient to recover their
carrying value based on the Company's previous business
strategies.  The majority of the assets were not utilized after
they were written off.  For those assets that we continued to
use, we had the ability to remove these assets from operations at
the time of the restructuring.

The $113 million of inventory charges relate to certain light-
lens products that were scrapped as a result of our decision to
accelerate the transition to digital products and excess spare
parts that were scrapped as a result of our decision to
centralize certain parts depots.

The 1998 Restructuring included provisions for consolidation of
56 European customer support centers into one facility and
implementing a shared services organization for back-office
operations in Ireland.

As of September 30, 2000, the remaining reserve balance for the
1998 restructuring program is $185 million. Approximately $160
million of the remaining reserve is for severance and related
costs with approximately $30 million designated for salary
continuance payments due to employees who have already been
terminated.  The 1998 restructuring program called for the
termination of 12,700 employees of which 11,400 have left the
Company as of September 30, 2000.  Approximately $130 million of
the severance reserve relates to the 1,300 employees remaining to
be terminated, most of whom are employed in our European
operations.  The remaining reserve of $25 million primarily
relates to the run off of lease cancellation payments.  We expect
the remaining reserve to be fully encumbered by the end of 2000.

9.  Segment Reporting

In the first quarter of 2000, we completed the realignment of our
operations to better align the company to serve its diverse
customers/distribution channels and to provide an industry-
oriented focus for global document services and solutions. As a
result of this realignment, our reportable segments have been
revised accordingly and are as follows: Industry Solutions,
General Markets and Developing Markets.

The Industry Solutions operating segment (ISO) covers the direct
sales and service organizations in North America and Europe. It
is organized around key industries and focused on providing our
largest customers with document solutions consisting of hardware,
software and services, including document outsourcing, systems
integration and document consulting.

The General Markets operating segment (GMO) includes sales agents
in North America, concessionaires in Europe and our Channels
Group which includes retailers and resellers. It is responsible
for increasing penetration of the general market space, including
small office solutions, products for networked work group
environments and personal/home office products. In addition, it
has responsibility for product development and acquisition for
its markets, providing customer- and channel-ready products and
solutions.

The Developing Markets operating segment (DMO) includes
operations in Latin America, China, Russia, India, the Middle
East and Africa. It takes advantage of growth opportunities in
emerging markets/countries around the world, building on the
leadership Xerox has already established in a number of those
markets.

Other businesses include several units, none of which met the
thresholds for separate segment reporting. The revenues included
in this group are primarily from Xerox Supplies Group (XSG) and
Xerox Engineering Systems (XES).

All corporate expenses, including interest, have been allocated
to the operating segments.

Operating segment profit or loss information for the three months

10.  Acquisitions

On January 1, 2000, we and Fuji Xerox completed the acquisition
of the Color Printing and Imaging Division of Tektronix, Inc.
(CPID).  The aggregate consideration paid of $925 million in
cash, which includes $73 million paid directly by Fuji Xerox, is
subject to certain post-closing adjustments.  CPID manufactures
and sells color printers, ink and related products, and supplies.
The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the purchase
method of accounting. The operating results of CPID have been
included in the consolidated statement of income since January 1,
2000.

The excess of cash paid over the fair value of net assets
acquired has been allocated to identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill.  An independent appraiser, using a discounted cash flow
approach, valued the identifiable intangible assets.  The value
of the identifiable intangible assets includes $27 million for
acquired in-process research and development which was written
off in the first quarter of 2000.  This charge represents the
fair value of certain acquired research and development projects
that were determined not to have reached technological
feasibility as of the date of the acquisition.  We determined the
amount of the purchase price to be allocated to in-process
research and development, based on the methodology that focused
on the after-tax cash flows attributable to the in-process
products combined with the consideration of the stage of
completion of the individual research and development project at
the date of acquisition.  The remaining excess of the purchase
price was allocated to other identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill.  Identifiable intangible assets included in the
valuation, exclusive of intangible assets acquired by Fuji Xerox,
were the installed customer base ($209 million), the distribution
network ($123 million), the existing technology ($103 million),
the workforce ($71 million), and trademarks ($23 million). These
identifiable assets are included in the Intangibles and other
assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The remaining excess
has been assigned to goodwill. Other identifiable intangible
assets and goodwill are being amortized on a straight-line basis
over their estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 25 years.

The valuation of the identifiable intangible assets, referred to
above, is based on studies and valuations which have been
finalized.  However the final goodwill amount may be affected by
any post-closing adjustments which could potentially reduce the
purchase price.

11.  Divestitures

In April 2000, the Company sold a 25 percent ownership interest
in its wholly-owned subsidiary, ContentGuard, to Microsoft, Inc.
for $50 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $23 million,
which is included in Other, net. An additional pre-tax gain of
$27 million was deferred and is included in Unearned income in
the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In connection with the sale,
ContentGuard also received $40 million from Microsoft for a non-
exclusive license of its patents and other intellectual property
and a $25 million advance against future royalty income from
Microsoft on sales of products incorporating ContentGuard's
technology. The license payment is being amortized over the life
of the license agreement of 10 years and the royalty advance will
be recognized in income as earned.

In June 2000, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. and
Canadian commodity paper business, including an exclusive license
for the Xerox brand, to Georgia Pacific and recorded a pre-tax
gain of approximately $40 million which is included in Other,
net. In addition to the proceeds from the sale of the business,
the Company will receive royalty payments on future sales of
Xerox branded commodity paper by Georgia Pacific and will earn
commissions on Xerox originated sales of commodity paper as an
agent for Georgia Pacific. The U.S. and Canadian commodity paper
business had annual sales of approximately $275 million of our
$1.0 billion total worldwide paper sales in 1999.

12.  Mexico Provision

For the nine months ended September 30, 2000, the Company
recorded a pre-tax provision of $170 million ($120 million after
taxes) related to its previously announced issues in Mexico.  A
portion of this provision includes an amount which would
ordinarily represent a charge for uncollectable accounts that
would be included in Selling, administrative, and general
expenses.  This amount is presently not determinable.

The provision relates to establishing reserves for uncollectable
long-term receivables, recording liabilities for amounts due to
concessionaires and, to a lesser extent, for adjustments related
to contracts that did not fully meet the requirements to be
recorded as sales-type leases. No further provisions are
expected.  The investigation of this matter by the Audit
Committee of our Board of Directors, with the assistance of
outside advisors, is presently being finalized.

In response to these issues, the Company has taken the following
actions - a number of senior local managers in Mexico were held
accountable and removed from the Company; a new general manager
was appointed in Mexico with a strong financial background; the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has launched an
independent investigation into the Mexican operation and an
extensive review of the Company's worldwide internal controls was
initiated to ensure that the issues identified in Mexico are not
present elsewhere.

In June 2000, the Company was advised that the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) had entered an order of a formal, non-
public investigation into our accounting and financial reporting
practices in Mexico.  We are cooperating fully with the SEC.

13.  Litigation

On March 10, 1994, a lawsuit was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Kansas by two independent
service organizations (ISOs) in Kansas City and St. Louis and
their parent company. Subsequently, a single corporate entity,
CSU, L.L.C. (CSU), was substituted for the three affiliated
companies. CSU claimed damages predominately resulting from the
Company's alleged refusal to sell parts for high-volume copiers
and printers to CSU prior to 1994. The Company's policies and
practices with respect to the sale of parts to ISOs were at issue
in an antitrust class action in Texas, which was settled by the
Company during 1994. Claims for individual lost profits of ISOs
who were not named parties, such as CSU, were not included in
that class action. The Company asserted counter-claims against
CSU alleging patent and copyright infringement relating to the
copying of diagnostic software and service manuals. On April 8,
1997, the District Court granted partial summary judgment in
favor of the Company on CSU's antitrust claims, ruling that the
Company's unilateral refusal to sell or license its patented
parts cannot give rise to antitrust liability. On January 8,
1999, the Court dismissed with prejudice all of CSU's antitrust
claims. The District Court also granted summary judgment in favor
of the Company on its patent infringement claim, leaving open
with respect to patent infringement only the issues of
willfulness and the amount of damages, and granted partial
summary judgment in favor of the Company with respect to some of
its claims of copyright infringement. A judgment in the amount of
$1 million was entered in favor of the Company and against CSU on
the copyright infringement counterclaim. On February 16, 2000,
the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
affirmed the judgment of the District Court dismissing CSU's
antitrust claims and on July 11, 2000 CSU petitioned the Supreme
Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Appeals Court's
judgment.

On April 11, 1996, an action was commenced by Accuscan Corp.
(Accuscan), in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, against the Company seeking unspecified
damages for infringement of a patent of Accuscan which expired in
1993. The suit, as amended, was directed to facsimile and certain
other products containing scanning functions and sought damages
for sales between 1990 and 1993. On April 1, 1998, the jury
entered a verdict in favor of Accuscan for $40 million. However,
on September 14, 1998, the Court granted the Company's motion for
a new trial on damages. The trial ended on October 25, 1999 with
a jury verdict of $10 million. The Company's motion to set aside
the verdict or, in the alternative, to grant a new trial was
denied by the Court. The Company is appealing to the Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Accuscan is appealing the new
trial grant which reduced the verdict from $40 million and
seeking a reversal of the jury's finding of no willful
infringement.  We are in the midst of the briefing schedule at
the Court of Appeals.

A consolidated lawsuit was filed in the United States District
Court for the Western District of Texas. It was a consolidation
of two previously separate lawsuits, one of which had been filed
in the United States District Court for the District of New
Jersey and had been transferred to Texas, and the other which was
commenced in Texas. Plaintiffs in both cases claimed that the
withdrawal of Crum & Forster Holdings, Inc. (a former subsidiary
of ours) (C&F) from the Xerox Corporation Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP) constituted a wrongful termination under
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Both cases
were also brought as purported class actions. The complaints in
the two cases asserted different legal theories for recovery. In
one case damages of $250 million were alleged and in the other
case damages were unspecified.

On October 4, 2000, the Court granted Xerox's motion for summary
judgment and dismissed the case in its entirety.  The plaintiffs
may still attempt to appeal the court's ruling.   Xerox will
vigorously defend any such appeal.

On June 24, 1999, Xerox Corporation was served with a summons and
complaint filed in the Superior Court of the State of California
for the County of Los Angeles. The complaint was filed on behalf
of 681 individual plaintiffs claiming damages as a result of
Xerox's alleged disposal and/or release of hazardous substances
into the soil, air and groundwater. On July 22, 1999 and on April
12, 2000,respectively, two additional complaints were filed in
the same Court, which have not yet been served on Xerox. These
separate actions are on behalf of an additional 80 plaintiffs and
140 plaintiffs, respectively, with the same claims for damages as
the June, 1999 action. Plaintiffs in all three cases further
allege that they have been exposed to such hazardous substances
by inhalation, ingestion and dermal contact, including but not
limited to hazardous substances contained within the municipal
drinking water supplied by the City of Pomona and the Southern
California Water Company. Plaintiffs' claims against Xerox
include personal injury, wrongful death (claimed in the first two
complaints), property damage, negligence, trespass, nuisance,
fraudulent concealment, absolute liability for ultra-hazardous
activities, civil conspiracy, battery and violation of the
California Unfair Trade Practices Act. Damages are unspecified.

We deny any liability for the plaintiffs' alleged damages and
intend to vigorously defend these actions. Xerox has not answered
or appeared in any of the cases because all three have either
been stayed by stipulation of the parties or order of the court.
Plaintiffs are currently seeking to have the three cases
coordinated with a number of other unrelated groundwater cases
pending in Southern California. Xerox is opposing coordination of
the cases.

On December 9, 1999, a complaint was filed in the United States
District Court for the District of Connecticut in an action
entitled Giarraputo, et al. vs. Xerox Corporation, Barry Romeril,
Paul Allaire and Richard Thoman which purports to be a class
action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all other purchasers
of Common Stock of the Registrant between January 25, 1999 and
October 7, 1999 (Class Period). On December 13, 1999, an amended
complaint was filed adding an additional named plaintiff,
extending the Class Period through December 10, 1999, and
expanding the class to include individuals who purchased call
options or sold put options.  The amended complaint alleges that
pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, each
of the defendants is liable as a participant in a fraudulent
scheme and course of business that operated as a fraud or deceit
on purchasers of the Company's Common Stock during the Class
Period by disseminating materially false and misleading
statements and/or concealing material facts. The amended
complaint further alleges that the alleged scheme:  (i) deceived
the investing public regarding the economic capabilities, sales
proficiencies, growth, operations and the intrinsic value of the
Company's Common Stock; (ii) allowed several corporate insiders,
such as the named individual defendants, to sell shares of
privately held Common Stock of the Company while in possession of
materially adverse, non-public information; and (iii) caused the
individual plaintiffs and the other members of the purported
class to purchase Common Stock of the Company at inflated prices.
The amended complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages in
favor of the plaintiffs and the other members of the purported
class against all defendants, jointly and severally, for all
damages sustained as a result of defendants' alleged wrongdoing,
including interest thereon, together with reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in the action, including counsel fees and
expert fees. Several additional class action complaints alleging
the same or substantially similar claims were filed in the same
Court.

On March 14, 2000, the Court issued an order consolidating all of
these related cases into a single action captioned In re Xerox
Corporation Securities Litigation, and appointing lead
plaintiffs, and lead and liaison counsel.  On April 28, 2000
plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint
on behalf of a redefined class consisting of themselves and all
other purchasers of Common Stock of Registrant during the period
between October 22, 1998 through October 7, 1999.

On June 12, 2000, the individual named defendants and Xerox
Corporation made a motion to dismiss the amended consolidated
class action complaint for failure to meet the pleading
requirements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.
Plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion on July 13, 2000.
The motion is pending.

The named individual defendants and we deny any wrongdoing and
intend to vigorously defend the action.

On July 5, 2000, a shareholder derivative action was commenced in
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York on
behalf of Registrant against all current members of the Board of
Directors (with the exception of Anne M. Mulcahy) (collectively,
the "Individual Defendants"), and Registrant, as a nominal
defendant.  Plaintiff claims breach of fiduciary duties related
to certain of the accounts receivable related to Registrant's
operations in Mexico. The complaint alleges that the Individual
Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by, among other
things, permitting wrongful business practices to occur,
inadequately supervising and failing to instruct employees and
managers of Registrant and taking no steps to institute
appropriate legal action against those responsible for
unspecified wrongful conduct.  Plaintiff claims that Registrant
has suffered unspecified damages but which are "expected to
exceed tens of millions of dollars", and seeks judgment, among
other things, requiring the Individual Defendants to pay to
Registrant the amounts by which Registrant has been damaged by
reason of their breach of their fiduciary duties and/or to the
extent they have been unjustly enriched and to institute and
enforce appropriate procedural safeguards to prevent the alleged
wrongdoing.

On October 5, 2000, the Individual Defendants and Xerox
Corporation made a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to
make a pre-suit demand upon the Board and for failure to state a
claim for breach of fiduciary duty.  The motion is pending.

The Individual Defendants deny the wrongdoing alleged in the
complaint and intend to vigorously defend the action.

On August 24, 2000, an action was commenced in the United States
District Court for the District of Connecticut against the
Company, KPMG, LLP ("KPMG"), and Paul A. Allaire, G. Richard
Thoman, Anne M. Mulcahy and Barry D. Romeril ("Individual
Defendants").  The action purports to be a class action on behalf
of the named plaintiff and all purchasers of Common Stock of the
Company during the period from January 25, 2000 and July 27, 2000
("Class").  Among other things, the complaint alleges that each
of the Company, KPMG and the Individual Defendants violated
Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended, and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5
thereunder, by participating in a fraudulent scheme that operated
as a fraud and deceit on purchasers of the Company's Common Stock
by disseminating materially false and misleading statements
and/or concealing material adverse facts relating to the
Company's Mexican operations.  The complaint alleges that this
scheme deceived the investing public regarding the true state of
the Company's financial condition and caused the named plaintiff
and other members of the alleged Class to purchase the Company's
Common Stock at artificially inflated prices.  The complaint
seeks unspecified compensatory damages in favor of the named
plaintiff and the other members of the alleged Class against the
Company, KPMG and the Individual Defendants, jointly and
severally, including interest thereon, together with reasonable
costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees.
Several additional class action complaints alleging the same or
substantially similar claims were filed in the same Court.

The Individual Defendants and we deny any wrongdoing alleged in
the complaint and intend to vigorously defend the action.


14.    Subsequent Events

During the third quarter we recorded the receipt of a premium of
approximately $24 million on the sale of equity put options.
This premium was recorded as an addition to Common shareholders'
equity.  In October 2000, the holder of these equity put options
exercised their option for early termination and settlement.  The
cost of this settlement to the Company was approximately $92
million for 7.5 million shares with an average strike price of
$18.98 per share.  This transaction will be recorded as a
reduction of Common shareholders' equity during the fourth
quarter of 2000.  These transactions, therefore, have resulted in
a net cash usage of $68 million. On October 24, 2000, we
announced a turnaround program, in which we outlined a wide-
ranging plan to sell assets, cut costs and strengthen our
strategic core.  Additionally, we are exploring alternatives to
provide financing for customers in a manner that does not involve
the Xerox balance sheet, and over time will provide financing to
our customers using third parties.  We are actively engaged in
discussions to sell certain assets, including: our operations in
China, a portion of the 50 percent ownership in Fuji Xerox, Xerox
Engineering Systems, and our interests in spin-off companies such
as ContentGuard and Inxight.  We are in discussions with a number
of parties to make a significant equity investment in our inkjet
business, we are exploring a joint venture with non-competitive
partners for our Palo Alto Research Center, and we are
considering outsourcing or selling certain manufacturing
operations.  Furthermore, we are in discussion to form a
strategic alliance for our European paper business and
commercializing our non-core technology assets through
partnerships with venture capital investors.  It is expected that
in most cases asset sales will result in a gain.

Regarding the cost reductions, we are in the process of
finalizing plans designed to reduce costs by $1.0 billion
annually, the majority of which will affect 2001.  The actions
include:

- - reallocating resources from headquarter operations to the
field, eliminating duplicative industry-and-product
organizations and, in certain developing market countries,
moving to a distributor-based product-sales approach,

- - reducing more than $200 million in manufacturing and supply
chain costs,

- - reducing service costs through greater emphasis on remote
diagnostics and third-party service providers, and by moving
activities into the operating companies to eliminate a
worldwide service staff organization,

- - reducing infrastructure and overhead across corporate
headquarters, manufacturing and research and development,

- - re-allocating research and development efforts to underpin
growth opportunities in solutions and color, working more
closely with Fuji Xerox to eliminate R&D redundancies and
scrutinizing all programs based on their affordability and
future profitability.

No provisions have been recorded relating to possible employee
separation as our plans have not been finalized.



Item 2                   Xerox Corporation
             Management's Discussion and Analysis of
           Results of Operations and Financial Condition

 Document Processing

Summary

Total 2000 third quarter revenues declined 4 percent to $4.5
billion compared with $4.6 billion in the 1999 third quarter.
Excluding adverse currency translation, pre-currency revenues
declined 1 percent.  Excluding the beneficial impact of the
January 1, 2000 acquisition of the Tektronix, Inc. Color Printing
and Imaging Division (CPID), pre-currency revenues declined 4
percent.

The 2000 third quarter loss reflected the revenue decline as well
as a significant operating margin decline. Equity income from
Fuji Xerox improved in the 2000 third quarter.

Including an additional $55 million pre-tax provision ($41
million after taxes) related to the company's previously
announced issues in Mexico, the net loss was $167 million in the
2000 third quarter. No further provisions for this issue are
expected.  Excluding the Mexico provision, the third quarter 2000
net loss was $126 million compared with net income of $339
million in the 1999 third quarter.

Total revenues in the first nine months of 2000 were $13.6
billion which was a decline of 2 percent compared with $13.8
billion in the first nine months of 1999.  Excluding adverse
currency translation, pre-currency revenues increased 1 percent.
Excluding the beneficial impact of the CPID acquisition, pre-
currency revenues declined 2 percent.  Year to date 2000 revenues
included an increase of approximately $40 million associated with
excellent growth in licensing patents from our intellectual
property portfolio and selling standalone software.

Including the effect of special items, we had a net loss of $265
million in the first nine months of 2000.  Excluding special
items, net income in the first nine months of 2000 declined 72
percent to $315 million from $1,130 million in the first nine
months of 1999.  Special items included the following after-tax
charges - $443 million in connection with the 2000 restructuring
program (including our $18 million share of a separate Fuji Xerox
restructuring charge), $17 million for acquired in-process
research and development associated with the CPID acquisition and
$120 million for the Mexico provision.  The decline in net income
reflects the significant gross margin deterioration and higher
SAG in the first nine months of 2000.


Diluted earnings/(loss) per share:

Including the 6 cent provision arising from the independent
investigation of our Mexico operations, our loss per share was
$0.26 in the 2000 third quarter.  Excluding this provision, the
third quarter 2000 loss per share was $0.20 compared with $0.47
earnings per share in the 1999 third quarter. The catch-up impact
of an effective tax rate increase adversely affected our results
by an estimated 6 cents and unfavorable third quarter year-over-
year currency adversely affected our results by an estimated 5
cents.

The CPID acquisition was non-dilutive on third quarter 2000
earnings as the expected synergies we are capturing from the
integration are offsetting the higher goodwill and interest
expense.

Including special items, the diluted loss per share was $0.44 for
the first nine months of 2000.  Excluding special items, diluted
earnings per share declined 72 percent to $0.43 in the first nine
months of 2000 from $1.55 in the first nine months of 1999.
Unfavorable year-over-year currency adversely impacted the first
nine months earnings by approximately 14 cents.

earnings (loss) per share (EPS) for the third quarter and first
nine months of 2000:

Pre-Currency Growth

To understand the trends in the business, we believe that it is
helpful to adjust revenue and expense growth (except for ratios)
to exclude the impact of changes in the translation of European
and Canadian currencies into U.S. dollars. We refer to this
adjusted growth as "pre-currency growth."

A substantial portion of our consolidated revenues is derived
from operations outside of the United States where the U.S.
dollar is not the functional currency. When compared with the
average of the major European and Canadian currencies on a
revenue-weighted basis, the U.S. dollar was approximately 11
percent stronger in the 2000 third quarter than in the 1999 third
quarter.  As a result, currency translation had an unfavorable
impact of approximately three percentage points on revenue growth
for both the quarter and year-to-date.

Dollars are in billions.

Industry Solutions Operations (ISO) covers the direct sales and
service organizations in North America and Europe. Revenues
declined 6 percent (3 percent pre-currency) in the 2000 third
quarter. Open sales territories and lower sales productivity as a
result of less experienced sales people following higher sales
turnover levels in the early part of this year were compounded by
persistent U.S. customer administration issues at a time when
competitive product capabilities have strengthened. Pricing
pressure increased in certain products including monochrome
digital multi-function products and DocuTech in the U.S. and
monochrome production products in Europe. Revenues in the 2000
third quarter declined in the U.S., France, Germany and Canada,
and reflected good growth in the U.K.

ISO revenues declined 6 percent (3 percent pre-currency) in the
first nine months of 2000 due to the continued sales force and
U.S. customer administration issues and intensified competitive
and pricing pressures.

General Markets Operations (GMO) includes sales agents in North
America, concessionaires in Europe and our Channels Group which
includes retailers and resellers.  General Markets Operations
revenues grew 7 percent (10 percent pre-currency) in the 2000
third quarter from the 1999 third quarter including the CPID
acquisition.  Excluding CPID, General Markets pre-currency
revenues declined 5 percent in the 2000 third quarter.  European
concessionaires had strong growth while revenues from North
American sales agents declined modestly. Excellent Channels
office color network printer and inkjet revenue growth was
somewhat offset by small office/home office monochrome printer
and copier declines. Initial shipments of our new DocuPrint M
series family of inkjet printers, resulting from our alliance
with Sharp Corporation and Fuji Xerox, began in the third
quarter.

GMO revenues increased 11 percent (14 percent pre-currency) in
the first nine months of 2000 including the favorable impact from
the CPID acquisition.  Excluding CPID, pre-currency revenues were
flat for the first nine months of 2000, driven by flat revenues
in North American sales agents.

Developing Markets Operations (DMO) includes operations in Latin
America, China, Russia, India, the Middle East and Africa. Third
quarter 2000 revenue growth was strong in Brazil reflecting the
improving economic environment and activity growth.  China and
the Middle East and Africa had excellent revenue growth in the
third quarter and Russia had strong revenue growth.  Revenue
declined in Argentina as well as a number of other Latin American
countries and in Mexico as this operation recovers from the
previously discussed operational issues.

DMO revenues increased 4 percent (4 percent pre-currency) in the
first nine months of 2000 reflecting excellent revenue growth in
China and the Middle East and Africa, strong growth in India, and
modest growth in Brazil, while revenue declined in Argentina and
Mexico.

The Company's Latin America operations in general, and Brazil in
particular, are subject to volatile economies and currency
fluctuations.  Our Brazilian operations currently represent
approximately 5 percent of total revenues, and as such, will
continue to have an impact on the Company's results of
operations.  Historically, the Brazilian operations have managed
to offset the impact of devaluation through pricing actions and
reductions in its cost base and accordingly have successfully
managed their operations so as to moderate the effects of these
economic events.  To date, the recovery in Brazil has not fully
returned to pre-1999 levels.

Fuji Xerox Co., Ltd., an unconsolidated entity jointly owned by
Xerox Limited and Fuji Photo Film Company Limited, develops,
manufactures and distributes document processing products in
Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and other areas of the Pacific
Rim. Fuji Xerox revenues grew 4 percent (1 percent pre-currency)
in the 2000 third quarter reflecting flat revenues in Japan and
good revenue growth in Fuji Xerox' other Asia Pacific
territories.

Fuji Xerox revenues grew 14 percent (3 percent pre-currency) in
the first nine months of 2000 reflecting modest revenue growth in
Japan and good revenue growth in Fuji Xerox' other Asia Pacific
territories.

Key Ratios and Expenses

The trend in key ratios was as follows:
                               1999                         2000      .
                 Q1     Q2     Q3     Q4     FY     Q1     Q2     Q3    YTD

Gross Margin   45.9%  45.3%  43.3%  41.8%  44.0%  42.0%* 40.8%  36.7%  39.9%*

SAG % Revenue  27.2   25.8   26.1   27.8   26.8   27.8   28.5   30.9   29.1

* Excludes inventory charges associated with the 2000 restructuring program.
If included, the Gross Margin in Q1 and YTD would have been 39.3% and 39.0%,
respectively.

1999 third quarter gross margin, SAG and R&D benefited from
significant reversals of first half 1999 provisions for overall
incentive compensation expense. As a result, the 2000 year over
year unfavorable gross margin and spending comparisons are
accentuated.

The gross margin declined by 6.6 percentage points in the 2000
third quarter from the 1999 third quarter, or 6.5 percentage
points excluding CPID. Approximately two-thirds of the gross
margin decline was the result of weak activity, including
DocuTech and Production Printing equipment sales, and unfavorable
product mix. In addition, unfavorable transaction currency and
competitive pricing pressures were only partially offset by
manufacturing and other productivity improvements.

Gross margin declined by 5.0 percentage points in the first nine
months of 2000 from the first nine months of 1999 or 4.7
percentage points excluding CPID.  The decline reflects weak
DocuTech and Production Printing equipment sales, competitive
price pressure and unfavorable currency.  In addition, gross
margin was adversely impacted by unfavorable product mix and
lower service gross margins, as service revenue declines have not
yet been accompanied by corresponding cost reductions.  Gross
margin in the first quarter of 2000 benefited from increased
licensing and stand-alone software revenues associated with the
licensing of a number of patents from our intellectual property
portfolio.

Selling, administrative and general expenses (SAG) grew 14
percent in the 2000 third quarter.  Excluding the favorable
effect of currency, SAG grew 18 percent, or 15 percent excluding
CPID. SAG includes $138 million and $316 million in bad debt
provisions in the 2000 third quarter and year-to-date which is
$54 million higher than the 1999 third quarter, and $108 million
higher than year-to-date 1999. The main drivers of the increase
in bad debts for both the quarter and year-to-date are primarily
in the U.S. as we continue to resolve aged billing and
receivables issues. SAG growth also includes increased sales
payline and incentive compensation partially offset by the impact
of increased open sales territories; significant transition costs
associated with the implementation of our European shared
services organization; the continuing persistent impact of the
U.S. customer administration issues and significant marketing,
advertising and promotional investments for our major inkjet
printer initiative. In the 2000 third quarter, SAG represented
30.9 percent of revenue compared with 26.1 percent of revenue in
the 1999 third quarter. Year-to-date, SAG represented 29.1
percent of revenue compared with 26.3 percent of revenue in 1999.

Research and development (R&D) expense grew 18 percent in the
2000 third quarter, or 13 percent excluding CPID, reflecting
increased program spending. We continue to invest in
technological development to maintain our position in the rapidly
changing document processing market with an added focus on
increasing the effectiveness and value of that investment. R&D
expense grew 5 percent for the first nine months of 2000, as
compared to 1999.  Xerox R&D remains technologically competitive
and is strategically coordinated with Fuji Xerox.

Worldwide employment declined by 300 in the 2000 third quarter to
96,000 as a result of 900 employees leaving the company under the
1998 and 2000 worldwide restructuring programs partially offset
by the net hiring of 600 employees, primarily for the company's
growing document outsourcing business.  Worldwide employment
increased by 1,400 in the first nine months of 2000 as a result
of our acquisition of CPID with 2,200 employees and a net hiring
of 1,800 employees, primarily in the second quarter and for the
Company's fast-growing document outsourcing business, partially
offset by 2,600 employees leaving the company under the 1998 and
2000 worldwide restructuring programs.

Gain on affiliate's sale of stock of $21 million, which was
recorded in the first quarter of 2000, reflects our proportionate
share of the increase in equity of Scansoft Inc. resulting from
Scansoft's issuance of stock in connection with an acquisition.
This gain is partially offset by a $5 million charge, in the
first quarter, reflecting our share of Scansoft's write-off of
in-process research and development associated with this
acquisition, which is included in Equity in net income of
unconsolidated affiliates. Scansoft, an equity affiliate, is a
developer of digital imaging software that enables users to
leverage the power of their scanners, digital cameras, and other
electronic devices.

The $66 million increase in Other, net, from the 1999 third
quarter largely reflects increased non-financing interest expense
and goodwill and other identifiable intangibles amortization
associated with the January, 2000 CPID acquisition as well as
increased non-financing interest expense associated with higher
interest rates and higher debt levels.  Total non-financing
interest expense was $112 million in the 2000 third quarter which
is $53 million higher than the 1999 third quarter. In the 2000
third quarter we recorded $28 million of increased interest
income on tax audit settlements which on a year-over-year basis
is largely offset by the 1999 third quarter gain of $20 million
on the sale of our remaining interest in Documentum, Inc.

For the first nine months of 2000, Other, net increased $94
million as the asset gains, described below, and the increased
interest income on tax audit settlements were more than offset by
increased non-financing interest expense and goodwill and other
identifiable intangibles amortization associated with the CPID
acquisition as well as increased non-financing interest expense
associated with higher interest rates and higher debt levels.
Total year-to-date non-financing interest expense was $289
million which is $99 million higher than the 1999 year-to-date.

In April 2000, the Company sold a 25 percent ownership interest
in its wholly-owned subsidiary, ContentGuard, to Microsoft, Inc.
and recognized a pre-tax gain of $23 million which is included in
Other, net. In connection with the sale, ContentGuard also
received $40 million from Microsoft for a non-exclusive license
of its patents and other intellectual property. This payment is
being amortized over the life of the license agreement of 10
years. In addition, ContentGuard will receive future royalty
income from Microsoft on sales of Microsoft products
incorporating ContentGuard's technology.

In June 2000, the Company completed the sale of its U.S. and
Canadian commodity paper business, including an exclusive license
for the Xerox brand, to Georgia Pacific and recorded a pre-tax
gain of approximately $40 million which is included in Other,
net. In addition to the proceeds from the sale of the business,
the Company will receive royalty payments on future sales of
Xerox branded commodity paper by Georgia Pacific and will earn
commissions on Xerox originated sales of commodity paper as an
agent for Georgia Pacific. The U.S. and Canadian commodity paper
business had annual sales of approximately $275 million of our
$1.0 billion total worldwide paper sales in 1999. Although future
revenue is expected to be lower as a result of the sale,
operating income should remain essentially unchanged as a result
of payments received under the royalty/agent elements of the
agreement. We expect a cash flow benefit as the existing working
capital is reduced.

During the third quarter, the Company recorded an additional pre-
tax provision of $55 million ($41 million after taxes or $0.06
per share) related to collection issues on long-term receivables
resulting from imprudent business practices associated with the
previously announced issues in Mexico.  In the second quarter,
the Company recorded a pre-tax provision of $115 million ($78
million after taxes or $0.11 per share).  A portion of these
provisions includes an amount which would ordinarily represent a
charge for uncollectable accounts that would be included in
Selling, administrative, and general expenses.  This amount is
presently not determinable.

Over a period of years, several senior managers in Mexico had
collaborated to circumvent Xerox accounting policies and
administrative procedures. The charges related to provisions for
uncollectable long-term receivables, the recording of liabilities
for amounts due to concessionaires and to a lesser extent for
contracts that did not fully meet the requirements to be recorded
as sales-type leases. No further provisions are expected.  The
investigation of this matter by the Audit Committee of our Board
of Directors, with the assistance of outside advisors, is
presently being finalized.

In response to these issues, the Company has taken the following
actions - a number of senior local managers in Mexico were held
accountable and removed from the Company; a new general manager
was appointed in Mexico with a strong financial background; the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has launched an
independent investigation into the Mexican operation and an
extensive review of the Company's worldwide internal controls was
initiated to ensure that the issues identified in Mexico are not
present elsewhere.

The Company was advised in June, 2000 that the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) had entered an order of a formal,
non-public investigation into our accounting and financial
reporting practices in Mexico. We are cooperating fully with the
SEC.

Income Taxes, Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Affiliates
and Minorities' Interests in Earnings of Subsidiaries

Income (Loss) before income taxes was a loss of $196 million in
the 2000 third quarter including the Mexico provision. Excluding
the Mexico provision, the loss before income taxes was $141
million in the 2000 third quarter compared with income of $505
million in the 1999 third quarter.

Including the effect of special items, the loss before income
taxes was $385 million in the first nine months of 2000.
Excluding special items, income before income taxes in the first
nine months of 2000 declined 73 percent to $435 million from
$1,632 million in the first nine months of 1999.  Special items
include the following on a pre-tax basis - a charge of $623
million in connection with the 2000 restructuring program, a $27
million charge for acquired in-process research and development
associated with the CPID acquisition and a $170 million provision
for Mexico.

The effective tax rate, including the tax benefit on the Mexico
provision, was 14.8 percent in the 2000 third quarter and 24.2
percent for the first nine months of 2000. Excluding the tax
benefit of the Mexico provision, the 2000 third quarter rate was
10.6 percent and 20.0 percent for the first nine months of 2000.
The 1999 third quarter, 1999 full year and the underlying 2000
first half tax rate was 31.0 percent. We expect the underlying
2000 full year tax rate to be similar to the underlying year-to-
date rate of 38.0 percent. The adjustment in the underlying tax
rate from 31.0 percent to 38.0 percent that was applied to the
first half income reduced the 2000 third quarter tax benefit and
increased the net loss by $38 million or 6 cents per share.  The
increase in the effective tax rate is due primarily to a lower
tax rate on losses in Europe compared with expected profits.

Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates is principally
our 50 percent share of Fuji Xerox income. Total equity in net
income increased by $5 million in the 2000 third quarter and $21
million for the first nine months of 2000 reflecting improved
Fuji Xerox business results and favorable currency translation.

Fuji Xerox revenues of $1.9 billion in the 2000 third quarter
increased 4 percent compared with the 1999 third quarter,
including the favorable impact of currency translation resulting
primarily from the strengthening yen compared with the U.S.
dollar.  Pre-currency revenue growth was 1 percent.  Net income
of $30 million in the 2000 third quarter increased 51 percent
from the 1999 third quarter driven by the higher revenues, higher
gross margin due primarily to manufacturing cost productivity, a
lower statutory tax rate and favorable currency.

Fuji Xerox revenues of $6.2 billion in the first nine months of
2000 increased 14 percent compared with the same period in 1999
including the favorable impact of currency translation.  Pre-
currency revenue growth was 3 percent.  Net income of $167
million in the first nine months of 2000 increased from the prior
year due to improved business results and favorable currency.

On March 31, 2000 we announced details of a worldwide
restructuring program designed to enhance shareholder value, spur
growth and strengthen the company's competitive position in the
digital marketplace primarily through cost and expense
reductions. In connection with this program, in the first quarter
of 2000 we recorded a pre-tax provision of $625 million ($444
million after taxes including our $18 million share of the Fuji
Xerox restructuring charge). The resulting pre-tax provision of
$625 million includes severance costs related to the elimination
of 5,200 positions, net worldwide through a combination of
voluntary programs and layoffs. The charge also includes $190
million related to facility closings and other asset write-offs
such as scrapping certain inventory. The $625 million pre-tax
charge was reduced by $2 million in the second quarter due to a
change in estimate.

The pre-tax savings from this restructuring plan, net of
implementation costs, are expected to be approximately $95
million in 2000 and an incremental $300 million in 2001. These
savings are not expected to be reinvested. Approximately 60
percent of the savings are expected in SAG with the balance in
other activities. With respect to the headcount reductions we
expect that approximately 3,400 positions will be eliminated by
the end of 2000 and the balance in early 2001.

As of September 30, 2000, approximately 1,200 employees had left
the company under the program, and termination benefits of $59
million have been charged to the reserve. Asset impairment,
inventory charges and other charges of $71 million, $119 million
and $10 million, respectively, have also been charged against the
restructuring reserve. The 2000 restructuring reserve balance at
September 30, 2000 totaled $354 million which relates to cash
expenditures to be incurred primarily during the remainder of
2000 and early 2001.

Additional details regarding the initiatives and status of the
2000 restructuring reserve are included in Note 5 of the "Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q.

In April 1998, we announced a worldwide restructuring program.
In connection with this program, we recorded a second quarter
1998 pre-tax provision of $1,644 million ($1,107 million after
taxes including our $18 million share of a restructuring charge
recorded by Fuji Xerox).  The program includes employment
reductions, the closing and consolidation of facilities, and the
write-down of certain assets.

As of September 30, 2000, approximately 11,400 employees had left
the company under the 1998 restructuring program. The majority of
the reserve balance of $185 million at September 30, 2000 relates
to expenditures to be incurred primarily during 2000 for the
completion of certain European initiatives and continued payments
associated with the severance and lease cancellation initiatives
already implemented.  We expect the remaining reserve to be fully
encumbered by the end of 2000.

The status of the 1998 restructuring reserve is included in Note
6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

On January 1, 2000 we completed the acquisition of the Tektronix,
Inc. Color Printing and Imaging Division (CPID) for $925 million
in cash including $73 million paid by Fuji Xerox for the Asia
Pacific operations of CPID.  This transaction resulted in
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets of
approximately $637 million, which will be amortized over their
useful lives, ranging from 7 to 25 years.  In addition, we
recognized a $27 million pre-tax charge in the 2000 first quarter
for acquired in-process research and development associated with
this acquisition.

New Accounting Standards. In 1998, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards (SFAS) No.133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments
and Hedging Activities." SFAS No. 133 requires companies to
recognize all derivatives as assets or liabilities measured at
their fair value. Gains or losses resulting from changes in the
values of those derivatives would be accounted for depending on
the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge
accounting. We will adopt SFAS No. 133, as amended, beginning
January 1, 2001. We do not expect this Statement to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Discontinued Operations - Insurance and Other

The net investment in our discontinued businesses which includes
Insurance and Other Discontinued Businesses totaled $743 million
at September 30, 2000 compared with $702 million at December 31,
1999.  The increase in the first nine months of 2000 was
primarily caused by the scheduled funding of reinsurance coverage
for certain of the former Talegen Holdings, Inc. companies to
Ridge Reinsurance Limited partially offset by proceeds from real
estate sales.

In July 2000, our OakRe life insurance business entered into an
agreement with a subsidiary of the buyer of Xerox Life whereby
the subsidiary assumed the remaining reinsurance liabilities
associated with the Single Premium Deferred Annuity policies
issued by Xerox Life. The agreement results in the completion of
the run-off of OakRe. We expect that by the end of the 2000, upon
regulatory approval, OakRe will pay a dividend of approximately
$80 million, including $60 million of cash and cash equivalents,
to Xerox Financial Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company. The dividend is approximately equal to the remaining
carrying value of our investment in OakRe.




Capital Resources and Liquidity

Historically, the Company's overall funding requirements have
been to finance customers' purchases of Xerox equipment and to a
lesser extent in recent years to fund working capital
requirements.  In addition, in 1998 we funded the $413 million
acquisition of XLConnect Solutions.  In 1999 we funded the
acquisition of OmniFax and the increase in our ownership in our
joint venture in India for a combined total of $102 million and
in 2000 we funded the $852 million acquisition of CPID.  The
primary sources of funding have been cash flows from operations
and borrowings under our commercial paper and term funding
programs plus some securitization of finance and trade
receivables.  Since the beginning of October 2000, the Company
has experienced a significant reduction in its ability to access
capital markets and uncommitted bank lines of credit.  Decisions
related to funding of our businesses will remain based on the
interest rate environment and capital market conditions as well
as our ability to access these markets.  Currently, these markets
and uncommitted bank lines are largely unavailable to us.

As a result, as of October 31, 2000 we had drawn down $5.3
billion under our $7 billion Revolving Credit Agreement dated as
of October 27, 1997 with a group of banks (the "Agreement").
These funds were used primarily to pay down commercial paper,
medium term notes and similar obligations.  We are in compliance
with the covenants, terms and conditions in the Agreement, which
matures on October 22, 2002, and we expect that the remaining
balance of the commitments under the Agreement will be fully
available to us to support the Company's business operations
going forward.

We anticipate that we will require approximately $1.1 billion
during the balance of the year to refinance commercial paper,
maturing medium term notes and maturing bank obligations.  The
Company does not have any other material short-term obligations
during the balance of the year to be financed through the
Agreement unless the Company's debt ratings are further
downgraded as discussed below.

The Company is implementing several global initiatives to reduce
costs and improve operations and sell certain non-core assets
that should positively affect the Company's capital resources and
liquidity position when completed.  These include the
implementation of a non-core asset divestiture program, which is
expected to generate between $2 billion and $4 billion when
completed.  In addition, the Company has initiated discussions to
change its current method of financing customer purchases of
Xerox equipment and to evaluate the sale of all or a portion of
the existing finance receivables portfolio, the proceeds of which
would be used primarily to reduce debt.

The Company has also initiated a worldwide cost reduction program
which should result in annualized expense savings of $1 billion
when completed.  These initiatives are expected to be completed
during 2001.

We believe that our liquidity is presently sufficient to meet our
current and our anticipated needs going forward, subject to
timely implementation and execution of the non-core asset sales
and the global operating initiatives discussed above.  Should the
Company not be able to successfully complete these initiatives or
non-core asset sales on a timely or satisfactory basis, it will
be necessary for the Company to obtain additional sources of
funds through other improvements in our operations or through
bridge or other financing from third parties.

In September 2000, we completed the securitization of certain
finance and accounts receivables in the United States as part of
our overall funding strategy.  Gross proceeds from the finance
receivables securitization totaled $411 million.  Since this
transaction was accounted for as a secured borrowing, the balance
sheet continues to reflect the receivables and related debt
obligation.  Proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization
program totaled $315 million and the related amounts were
deducted from the balance sheet as a result of the sale.  The
earnings impact of these transactions was not material.

The credit rating agencies that assign ratings to the Company's
debt have recently taken various actions including downgrading
the Company's senior debt and short-term debt.  As of November
13, 2000, Moody's debt ratings were Baa2 and P-2, respectively,
and the Company's long-term and short-term ratings were being
reviewed for possible downgrade; Fitch debt ratings were BBB- and
F3, respectively, and the ratings were on Ratings Watch Negative
and Standard and Poors debt ratings were BBB- and A-3,
respectively, and the ratings outlook was stable.

The recent lowering of the ratings of the Company's debt are
expected to result in higher borrowing costs and limited access
to the capital markets for the Company going forward.  Should the
Company be further downgraded by either Moody's or Standard and
Poors to non-investment grade status, the counterparties to
certain of the Company's derivative agreements may require the
Company to repurchase the obligations under such agreements from
the counterparties in the approximate aggregate amount of $110
million.  In addition, if both credit rating agencies downgrade
the Company to non-investment grade status, the Company may be
required to repurchase an additional approximate aggregate amount
of $130 million.  Finally, if either credit rating agency
downgrades the Company to a non-investment grade status, the
Company may be precluded from making subsequent accounts
receivable sales under the Accounts Receivable Sale Agreement
(see Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).  If this were to occur
the majority of the $315 million would require refinancing from
another source within two to three months.  There is no assurance
that the Company's credit ratings will be maintained, the
Company's credit ratings will not be downgraded below investment
grade, the various counterparties to qualifying derivative
agreements would not require the obligations to be repurchased by
the Company and/or that the Company will have ready access to the
credit markets in the future.

Total debt, including ESOP and Discontinued Operations debt not
shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets, was $17,197
million at September 30, 2000, reflecting a decline of $360
million from June 30, 2000 (primarily related to completion of
our accounts receivable securitization program).  Compared with
December 31, 1999, total debt increased by $2,196 million.  The
changes in total indebtedness during the first nine months of
2000 and 1999 are summarized as follows (in millions):



                                        2000        1999
Total debt* as of January 1           $15,001     $15,107

Non-Financing Businesses:

Discontinued businesses***                 92        (109)

Proceeds from divestitures                (90)          -
All other changes, primarily currency    (244)        (15)
Total debt* as of September 30        $17,197     $15,688

* Includes discontinued operations.

** Includes reallocation from and to our non-financing businesses of a portion
of Xerox do Brasil's U.S. dollar denominated debt used to fund customer
finance receivables denominated in Brazilian currency.  The reallocations were
performed consistent with the 8:1 debt to equity guideline used in our
customer financing businesses.

*** The increase in cash usage primarily reflected a one-time tax payment in
2000 in settlement of prior year tax liability and the reduced net cash
proceeds from the sale of assets in 2000 versus 1999.  We anticipate that
discontinued businesses will generate cash for the balance of the year that
will almost fully offset the first nine months usage.

In summary, the Company's liquidity is currently provided through
various financing strategies including securitizations and
utilization of its Revolving Credit Agreement.  The Company is
also implementing global initiatives to reduce costs and improve
operations, negotiating the sale of certain non-core assets, and
discussing with third parties possible incremental bridge or
other financing facilities.  In addition, the Company has
initiated discussions to change its current method of financing
customer purchases of Xerox equipment and to evaluate the sale of
all or a portion of the existing finance receivables portfolio.
The adequacy of the Company's continuing liquidity is dependent
upon its ability to successfully generate positive cash flow from
an appropriate combination of these sources.

Document Processing Non-Financing Operations

The following table summarizes document processing non-financing
operations cash generation and usage for the nine months ended
September 30, 2000 and 1999 (in millions):

                                            2000        1999

Net Cash Usage                           $(1,391)    $  (687)

* Includes on-lease equipment depreciation of $452 and $332 million in the
nine months ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, respectively

Non-financing operations' net cash usage during the first nine
months of 2000 and 1999 totaled $1,391 million and $687 million,
respectively.  On a year-over-year basis, lower non-financing
income was partially offset by higher non-cash on-lease equipment
depreciation charges and higher goodwill and intangible asset
amortization primarily associated with our January, 2000 CPID
acquisition.  During the third quarter of 2000 net cash
generation totaled $131 million.

Additions to land, buildings and equipment primarily include
office furniture and fixtures, production tooling and our
investments in Ireland, where we are consolidating European
customer support centers and investing in inkjet manufacturing.
The decline in the first nine months of 2000 versus 1999 is
primarily due to lower spending for the Ireland projects.
Inventory growth during the first nine months of 2000 was higher
than in the first nine months of 1999 due to lower than
anticipated equipment sales and some inventory build  for new
products, primarily the DocuColor 2000 family and Inkjet.  On-
lease equipment increased by $234 million more than in 1999,
before depreciation, reflecting growth in our document
outsourcing business and increased customer preference to finance
equipment on operating leases. Accounts receivable cash
generation improved by $563 million reflecting the $315 million
accounts receivable securitization and some improvement in days
sales outstanding. The increase in other asset and liability
usage is due primarily to lower deferred tax accruals due to
lower income as well as higher cash tax payments in 2000 versus
1999. These unfavorable items were partially offset by lower cash
payments made under employee compensation plans and payments
received in connection with the license and royalty elements of
the ContentGuard transaction.

Cash payments related to the 1998 restructuring amounted to $153
million and $339 million in first nine months of 2000 and 1999,
respectively.  The decline reflects the maturity and overall
wind-down of the program. Cash payments related to the 2000
restructuring amounted to $69 million. The status of the
restructuring reserves is included in Notes 5 and 6 of the "Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q.

Financing Businesses

Customer financing-related debt declined by $282 million in the
first nine months of 2000 and by $1,154 million in the first nine
months of 1999.  Year-to-date 2000 new business was funded with
financing business net income and higher deferred taxes. The 1999
change reflects the impact on our Brazilian finance receivables
of the significant first quarter 1999 devaluation of the
Brazilian real and the pay-down of debt with the $1,150 million
proceeds from the June and September 1999 finance receivable
securitizations.


For analytical purposes, total equity includes common equity,
ESOP preferred stock, mandatorily redeemable preferred securities
and minorities' interests.

total equity during the first nine months of 2000 and 1999 (in
millions):

Risk Management

Xerox is typical of multinational corporations because it is
exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange
rates and interest rates that could affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

We have entered into certain financial instruments to manage
interest rate and foreign currency exposures. These instruments
are held solely for hedging purposes and include interest rate
swap agreements, forward exchange contracts and foreign currency
swap agreements. We do not enter into derivative instrument
transactions for trading purposes and employ long-standing
policies prescribing that derivative instruments are only to be
used to achieve a set of very limited objectives. Considering our
current situation, there is no assurance we will be able to
continue to execute interest rate and foreign currency swap
transactions with counterparties.

Currency derivatives are primarily arranged in conjunction with
underlying transactions that give rise to foreign currency-
denominated payables and receivables, for example, an option to
buy foreign currency to settle the importation of goods from
foreign suppliers, or a forward exchange contract to fix the
dollar value of a foreign currency-denominated loan.

With regard to interest rate hedging, virtually all customer-
financing assets earn fixed rates of interest. Therefore, within
industrialized economies, we "lock in" an interest rate spread by
arranging fixed-rate liabilities with similar maturities as the
underlying assets and fund the assets with liabilities in the
same currency.  We refer to the effect of these conservative
practices as "match funding" customer financing assets. This
practice effectively eliminates the risk of a major decline in
interest margins during a period of rising interest rates.
Conversely, this practice effectively eliminates the opportunity
to materially increase margins when interest rates are declining.

Pay fixed-rate and receive variable-rate swaps are often used in
place of more expensive fixed-rate debt. Additionally, pay
variable-rate and receive fixed-rate swaps are used from time to
time to transform longer-term fixed-rate debt into variable-rate
obligations. The transactions performed within each of these
categories enable more cost-effective management of interest rate
exposures. The potential risk attendant to this strategy is the
non-performance of the swap counterparty. We address this risk by
arranging swaps with a diverse group of strong-credit
counterparties, regularly monitoring their credit ratings and
determining the replacement cost, if any, of existing
transactions.

Our currency and interest rate hedging are typically unaffected
by changes in market conditions as forward contracts, options and
swaps are normally held to maturity consistent with our objective
to lock in currency rates and interest rate spreads on the
underlying transactions.

*Revenues are pre-currency except total dollars.  Dollars are in billions.
Revenues include major product categories only and exclude some small
operations.

Black & White Office and Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) revenues
include our expanding family of Document Centre digital multi-
function products, light-lens copiers under 90 pages per minute,
our DocuPrint N series of laser printers and digital copiers sold
through indirect sales channels, and facsimile products.
Revenues declined 7 percent in the 2000 third quarter from the
1999 third quarter including declines in office copying, indirect
channels laser printing and copying and facsimile. Office copying
revenue declined as equipment sales declined reflecting lower
light-lens copier installations and increasing competitive
pressures partially offset by higher Document Centre equipment
sales. All other revenues include revenues from service, document
outsourcing, rentals, supplies and finance income, and represent
the revenue stream that follows equipment placement. These office
copying third quarter 2000 revenues are essentially unchanged
from the 1999 third quarter as increases in Document Centre have
offset light lens declines. Black & White Office and SOHO
revenues represented 40 percent of third quarter 2000 revenues
compared with 43 percent in the 1999 third quarter.

Black & White Production revenues include DocuTech, Production
Printing, and light-lens copiers over 90 pages per minute.
Revenues declined 15 percent in the 2000 third quarter from the
1999 third quarter reflecting very weak equipment sales and a
modest decline in all other revenues.  DocuTech and production
printing revenues declined in the 2000 third quarter, as
equipment sales were very weak due to open sales territories and
fewer experienced sales people; unfavorable product mix;
increased DocuTech competition resulting in increased pricing
pressure, more contested sales and elongated sales cycles; and
the beginning of the movement of some printing to electronic
substitutes. Production light-lens revenues declined
significantly in the 2000 third quarter from the 1999 third
quarter as the transition to digital products continued. Post
equipment install revenues were also adversely affected by
equipment sale revenue declines in earlier quarters.  Black &
White Production revenues represented 26 percent of third quarter
2000 revenues compared with 31 percent in the 1999 third quarter.

Color Copying and Printing revenues grew 74 percent in the 2000
third quarter from the 1999 third quarter including the impact of
the CPID acquisition.  Excluding CPID, color revenues grew 34
percent reflecting a continued significant acceleration from 1999
and first half 2000 trends.  Growth reflects the success of our
DocuColor 2060 and DocuColor 2045 Digital Color Presses which
began shipments in June, 2000 as well as continued excellent
placements of the DocuColor 12 and Document Centre ColorSeries
50, the industry's first color-enabled digital multi-function
product, which were introduced in the 1999 second half. Inkjet
revenue had excellent growth reflecting initial shipments of our
new DocuPrint M series of inkjet printers partially offset by
lower pricing, as anticipated. Including the CPID acquisition,
color revenues represented 16 percent of third quarter 2000
revenues compared with 9 percent in the 1999 third quarter.

Revenue By Type

The pre-currency growth rates by type of revenue are as follows:

                                     1999                  2000     .
                        Q1    Q2    Q3    Q4    FY     Q1    Q2   Q3   YTD

Equipment Sales         (3)%   2%    5%   (8)%  (2)%    5%   (5)% (9)%  (4)%
All Other Revenues       1     4     -     -     1      6     2    4     4

Total Revenues          (1)%   4%    2%   (3)%   -%     6%   (1)% (1)    1%


Equipment sales declined 9 percent in the 2000 third quarter
including the beneficial impact of the CPID acquisition.
Excluding CPID, equipment sales declined 13 percent due to weak
equipment sales primarily in North America resulting from open
sales territories and lower sales productivity as a result of
less experienced sales people following higher sales turnover
levels in the early part of this year, persistent customer
administration issues, intense competition and pricing pressures.
Channels equipment sales, excluding CPID, reflected weak small
office/home office monochrome laser printer and copier equipment
sales. Inkjet equipment sales had excellent growth reflecting
initial shipments of our new DocuPrint M series of inkjet
printers partially offset by anticipated lower pricing and
unfavorable mix.

All other revenues, including revenues from service, document
outsourcing, rentals, standalone software, supplies, paper and
finance income, represent the revenue stream that follows
equipment placement. These revenues are primarily a function of
our installed population of equipment, usage levels, pricing and
interest rates. All other revenues in the 2000 third quarter grew
4 percent compared with the 1999 third quarter.  Excluding CPID,
all other revenues grew 1 percent. All other revenues benefited
from excellent growth in document outsourcing and strong supplies
growth from our growing installed population of inkjet and laser
printers and copiers sold through indirect channels. Revenues
were adversely impacted by lower service revenues reflecting the
recent trend of lower equipment sales and continue to be
adversely affected by the page volume impact of distributed
printing and pages diverted from copiers to printers.  Finance
income was lower largely due to the unfavorable flow-through
impact of the 1999 finance receivables securitizations and the
year over year impact of the $11 million gain from the third
quarter 1999 securitization as well as lower equipment sales.

Document Outsourcing revenues are split between Equipment Sales
and all other revenues.  Where document outsourcing contracts
include revenue accounted for as equipment sales, this revenue is
included in Equipment Sales, and all other document outsourcing
revenues, including service, equipment rental, supplies, paper,
and labor, are included in all other revenues.  Document
Outsourcing, excluding equipment sales revenue, grew 22 percent
in the 2000 third quarter.

of such Borrowing and the account to which the funds being borrowed should be
sent.  The Funding Agent shall, not later than 9:30 a.m. (London time) on the
day of such proposed Swingline Borrowing, notify each French Franc Swingline
Bank or Sterling Swingline Bank, as applicable, in writing (including by
facsimile) of its proportionate share of such Borrowing, the date of such
Borrowing and the account to which it should send the funds being borrowed
from it.

     SECTION 2.03.  Competitive Advances.  (a)  In addition to Contractual
Advances and Swingline Advances, a Borrower may request the Funding Agent to
obtain Competitive Bids under this Section for Competitive Advances (to be
made in Dollars or any Alternative Currency as such Borrower elects pursuant
to Section 2.03(b)).

     (b)  In order to request Competitive Bids, a Borrower shall deliver, by
hand, telex or facsimile, to the Funding Agent a duly completed Competitive
Bid Request in substantially the form of Exhibit B-4 hereto, to be received by
the Funding Agent:

         (i)   at its Chicago Office not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time)
(x) five Business Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, in the case of
LIBOR Competitive Advances in an Alternative Currency, (y) four Business Days
before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, in the case of LIBOR Competitive
Advances in Dollars and (z) one Business Day before a proposed Competitive
Borrowing, in the case of Fixed Rate Competitive Advances in Dollars, or

         (ii)  at its London Office, not later than 10:00 a.m. (London time)
one Business Day before a proposed Competitive Borrowing in the case of Fixed
Rate Competitive Advances in an Alternative Currency.

A Competitive Bid Request that does not conform substantially to the format of
Exhibit B-4 shall be rejected, and the Funding Agent shall promptly notify the
Borrower of such rejection by telex or facsimile.  Such request shall in each
case refer to this Agreement and specify (w) whether the Advances then being
requested are to be LIBOR Competitive Advances or Fixed Rate Competitive
Advances, (x) the date of such Advances (which shall be a Business Day), (y)
the proposed currency and aggregate principal amount thereof (which shall be
an integral multiple of 1,000,000 units of the relevant currency and shall not
be less than $25,000,000 in Dollar Amount), and (z) the Interest Period with
respect thereto (which may not end after the Termination Date).  Promptly
after its receipt of a Competitive Bid Request that is not rejected as
aforesaid, the Funding Agent shall invite by telex or facsimile (substantially
in the form set forth in Exhibit C hereto) the Lenders to bid, on the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, to make Competitive Advances pursuant to
such Competitive Bid Request.

     (c)  Each Lender may, in its sole discretion, make one or more
Competitive Bids to the Funding Agent in response to a Borrower's Competitive
Bid Request.  Each Competitive Bid by a Lender must be received by the Funding
Agent via telex or facsimile, substantially in the form of Exhibit D hereto:

         (i)   at its Chicago Office, (x) not later than 9:30 a.m. (Chicago
time) four Business Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, in the case
of LIBOR Competitive Advances in an Alternative Currency, (y) not later than
9:30 a.m. (Chicago time) three Business Days before a proposed Competitive
Borrowing, in the case of LIBOR Competitive Advances in Dollars, and (z) not
later than 9:15 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of a proposed Competitive
Borrowing, in the case of Fixed Rate Competitive Advances in Dollars, or

         (ii)  at its London Office, not later than 9:15 a.m. (London time)
on the date of a proposed Competitive Borrowing, in the case of Fixed Rate
Competitive Advances in an Alternative Currency.

Competitive Bids that do not conform substantially to the format of Exhibit D
may be rejected by the Funding Agent after conferring with, and upon the
instruction of, the relevant Borrower, and the Funding Agent shall notify the
Lender of such rejection as soon as practicable.  Each Competitive Bid shall
refer to this Agreement and specify (x) the maximum principal amount (in the
relevant currency) (which shall be an integral multiple of 1,000,000 units of
the relevant currency, shall not be less than $5,000,000 in Dollar Amount and
may be equal to the entire amount of the Competitive Borrowing requested by
the Borrower) of the Competitive Advance that the Lender is willing to make to
the Borrower and (y) the Competitive Bid Rate at which the Lender is prepared
to make such Competitive Advance.  A Competitive Bid submitted by a Lender
pursuant to this subsection (c) shall be irrevocable.

     (d)  The Funding Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower by telex or
facsimile of all the Competitive Bids made, the Competitive Bid Rate and the
maximum principal amount of each Competitive Advance in respect of which a
Competitive Bid was made and the identity of the Lender that made each bid.
The Funding Agent shall send a copy of all Competitive Bids to the Borrower
for its records as soon as practicable after completion of the bidding process
set forth in this Section 2.03.

     (e)  The Borrower may in its sole and absolute discretion, subject only
to the provisions of this subsection (e), accept or reject any Competitive
Bid referred to in subsection (d) above.  The Borrower shall notify the
Funding Agent by telex or facsimile whether and to what extent it has decided
to accept or reject any or all of the bids referred to in subsection (d)
above:

         (i)   at its Chicago Office not later than 10:30 a.m. (Chicago time)
(x) four Business Days before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, in the case of
LIBOR Competitive Advances in an Alternative Currency, (y) three Business Days
before a proposed Competitive Borrowing, in the case of LIBOR Competitive
Advances in Dollars, and (z) on the date of a proposed Competitive Borrowing,
in the case of Fixed Rate Competitive Advances in Dollars, or

         (ii)  at its London Office not later than 10:30 a.m.(London time) on
the date of a proposed Competitive Borrowing in the case of Fixed Rate
Competitive Advances in an Alternative Currency;

provided that (v) the failure by the Borrower to give such notice shall be
deemed to be a rejection of all bids referred to in subsection (d) above, (w)
the Borrower shall not accept a bid made at a particular Competitive Bid Rate
if the Borrower has decided to reject a bid made at a lower Competitive Bid
Rate, (x) if the Borrower shall accept bids made at a particular Competitive
Bid Rate but shall decline to borrow, or be restricted by other conditions
hereof from borrowing, the maximum principal amount of Competitive Advances in
respect of which bids at such Competitive Bid Rate have been made, then the
Borrower shall accept a pro rata portion of each bid made at such Competitive
Bid Rate based as nearly as possible on the respective maximum principal
amounts of Competitive Advances for which such bids were made (provided that
if any amount so allocated is less than $5,000,000 in Dollar Amount or is not
an integral multiple of 1,000,000 units of the relevant currency, the Borrower
shall select the Lenders to be allocated such Competitive Advances and shall
round allocations up or down to the next amount which is at least $5,000,000
in Dollar Amount and an integral multiple of 1,000,000 units of the relevant
currency, as the Borrower shall deem appropriate), (y) no bid shall be
accepted for a Competitive Advance unless such Competitive Advance is in a
Dollar Amount of at least $5,000,000 and is part of a Competitive Borrowing in
an aggregate Dollar Amount of at least $25,000,000 and (z) no bid shall be
accepted for a Competitive Advance if, immediately after such Competitive
Advance is made, (i) the Total Advances Outstanding would exceed the aggregate
amount of the Commitments or (ii) the Overseas Advances Outstanding would
exceed $4,000,000,000.

     (f)  The Funding Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders whether or not
their Competitive Bids have been accepted (and if so, in what amount and at
what Competitive Bid Rate) by telex or facsimile sent by the Funding Agent,
and each successful bidder will thereupon become bound, subject to the other
applicable conditions hereof, to make each Competitive Advance in respect of
which its bid has been accepted.

     (g)  A Competitive Borrowing shall not be made within five Business Days
of the date of any other Competitive Borrowing.

     (h)  If the Funding Agent in the capacity of a Lender shall elect to
submit a Competitive Bid, it shall submit such bid to the Borrower not later
than fifteen minutes prior to the latest time at which the other Lenders are
permitted to submit their bids to the Funding Agent pursuant to Section
2.03(c).

     (i)  Each Borrower shall pay to each Lender which makes a Competitive
Advance to such Borrower under this Section interest on the unpaid principal
amount of such Competitive Advance from the date of such Competitive Advance
to the date the principal amount of such Competitive Advance is repaid in
full, payable on each Interest Payment Date for such Competitive Advance and
on the date the principal amount of such Competitive Advance is repaid in
full, at the rate of interest specified for such Competitive Advance by such
Lender; provided that any amount of principal which is not paid when due
(whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) shall bear
interest, payable on demand from time to time, from the date on which such
amount is due until such amount is paid in full, at the Default Rate as in
effect from time to time.

     (j)  Promptly upon receiving the first Competitive Bid Request for Fixed
Rate Competitive Advances in a particular Alternative Currency (or earlier, if
requested to do so by a Borrower), the Funding Agent shall determine whether
adequate time is provided in this Section for the actions to be taken in
connection with Competitive Bids for Fixed Rate Competitive Advances in such
Alternative Currency (the "Relevant Type of Competitive Advances") and advise
Xerox of such determination.  If the Funding Agent advises Xerox that the time
or times provided in this Section are adequate for the Relevant Type of
Competitive Advances, such time or times shall apply in connection with the
Relevant Type of Competitive Advances thereafter.  If the Funding Agent
advises Xerox that inadequate time is provided in this Section for any such
action or actions, the Funding Agent shall not be obligated to take any action
in connection with a Competitive Bid Request for the Relevant Type of
Competitive Advances until the Funding Agent and Xerox shall have agreed on a
different time for such action or actions and the Funding Agent shall have
notified the Lenders thereof.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
other subsections of this Section, if any such notice is given, the time or
times specified by the Funding Agent therein shall apply in connection with
the Relevant Type of Competitive Advances thereafter.  However, if
circumstances change, Xerox and the Funding Agent may agree to change any time
or times specified in this Section or in a notice delivered pursuant to this
subsection and the new time or times so agreed upon shall apply in connection
with Competitive Bid Requests made after the Lenders have been notified by the
Funding Agent thereof.

     SECTION 2.04.  Funding the Advances.  (a)  In the case of any Borrowing
to be made in Dollars, not later than 12:30 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of
such Borrowing, each Lender shall, through its Applicable Lending Office, make
its share of such Borrowing available at the Chicago Office of the Funding
Agent in Federal or other immediately available funds. Upon receipt of such
funds, unless the Funding Agent determines that any applicable condition
specified in Article 3 has not been met, the Funding Agent shall deposit such
funds in Federal or other immediately available funds into the account of the
relevant Borrower at The First National Bank of Chicago specified in the
Notice of Borrowing relating to such Borrowing.

     (b)  In the case of any French Franc Swingline Borrowing, unless the
Funding Agent advises the French Franc Swingline Banks that an applicable
condition specified in Article 3 has not been met, each French Franc Swingline
Bank shall, through its Swingline Lending Office, make its share of such
Borrowing available to the relevant Borrower by wiring or otherwise
transferring same day funds on the date of such Borrowing to such account at
such bank as such Borrower shall have designated for the purpose in the
applicable Notice of Borrowing.

     (c)  In the case of any Sterling Swingline Borrowing, unless the Funding
Agent advises the Sterling Swingline Banks that an applicable condition
specified in Article 3 has not been met, each Sterling Swingline Bank shall,
through its Swingline Lending Office, make its share of such Borrowing
available  to the relevant Borrower by wiring or otherwise transferring same
day funds, not later than 2:00 p.m. (London time) on the date of such
Borrowing, to such account at such bank as such Borrower shall have designated
for the purpose in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.

     (d)  In the case of any Borrowing of one or more Competitive Advances in
an Alternative Currency, unless the Funding Agent advises the participating
Lenders that an applicable condition specified in Article 3 has not been met,
each participating Lender shall make its share of such Borrowing available to
the relevant Borrower on the date of such Borrowing, in such Alternative
Currency (in such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of
international transactions in such Alternative Currency), by wiring or
otherwise transferring such funds to such account at such bank as such
Borrower shall have designated for the purpose in the applicable Competitive
Bid Request (which account and bank shall be specified by the Funding Agent in
the applicable Notice of Competitive Bid Request).

     (e)  Each notice referred to in Section 2.01(d), 2.02(d), 2.03(e) or
2.06(a) shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower giving such notice,
and, in respect of any Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Advances, LIBOR
Competitive Advances, Swingline Advances or Fixed Rate Competitive Advances
specified in such notice, such Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against
any loss or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure (i) in
the case of Section 2.01(d), 2.02(d) or 2.03(e) to fulfill on or before the
date specified for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article 3 or (ii) in the case of Section 2.06(a), to make the relevant
conversion or continuation, including, in each case, without limitation, any
loss (including Loss of Anticipated Profits) or expense incurred by reason of
the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing
or to be maintained by such Lender as a result of such conversion or
continuation when, as a result of such failure, such Advance is not made on
such date or such conversion or continuation does not occur on such date.


     (f)  In the case of a Contractual Borrowing or a Competitive Borrowing to
be made in Dollars, unless the Funding Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender before the date of such Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Funding Agent such Lender's share of such Borrowing, the
Funding Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available to the
Funding Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section 2.04(a)
and the Funding Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.  If and to the
extent that such Lender shall not have so made such share available to the
Funding Agent, such Lender and the relevant Borrower severally agree to repay
to the Funding Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to the relevant Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the
Funding Agent, at (A) if such amount is repaid by the relevant Borrower, a
rate per annum equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and the
interest rate applicable to such Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.06 and (B) if
such amount is repaid by such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (if
such Borrowing is in Dollars) or the applicable LIBO Rate (if such Borrowing
is in an Alternative Currency).  If such Lender shall repay to the Funding
Agent such corresponding amount, the relevant Borrower shall not be required
to repay such amount and the amount so repaid by such Lender shall constitute
such Lender's Advance included in such Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement.

     (g)  The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as
part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if
any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the
Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

     SECTION 2.05.  Illegality or Unavailability of Appropriate Deposits.  (a)
 Anything in Section 2.04 to the contrary notwithstanding, if any Lender shall
(i) at least one Business Day before the date of any requested Borrowing of
Eurodollar Advances or LIBOR Competitive Advances or any conversion of
Alternate Base Rate Advances to Eurodollar Advances or any continuation of
outstanding Eurodollar Advances for an additional Interest Period pursuant to
Section 2.06 or (ii  by 11:00 a.m. (Paris time) on the date of any French
Franc Swingline Borrowing or (iii) by 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the date of
any Sterling Swingline Borrowing, notify the Funding Agent that the
introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or
regulation makes it unlawful, or that any central bank or other governmental
authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Applicable
Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Eurodollar
Advances, LIBOR Competitive Advances or Swingline Advances in any currency to
any Borrower or to fund or maintain outstanding Eurodollar Advances,  LIBOR
Competitive Advances or Swingline Advances in any currency to any Borrower,
the obligations of such Lender to such Borrower to make such Advances in the
affected currency or to convert outstanding Alternate Base Rate Advances to
Eurodollar Advances or to continue outstanding Eurodollar Advances for an
additional Interest Period shall be suspended until such Lender shall notify
the Funding Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
exist, and each outstanding Eurodollar Advance of such Lender to such Borrower
shall be converted to an Alternate Base Rate Advance on the last day of the
then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Advance (subject to
subsection (b) below), and interest and principal on each such Alternate Base
Rate Advance shall be payable contemporaneously, and on a pro rata basis, with
the related Eurodollar Advances of the other Lenders.

     (b)  If any Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to
maintain and fund any of its outstanding Eurodollar Advances,  LIBOR
Competitive Advances in any currency or Swingline Advances in any currency
until the end of the current Interest Period related thereto due to an event
described in subsection (a) above and shall so notify the Funding Agent, the
Borrowers shall immediately (i) in the case of Eurodollar Advances,  convert
each such Eurodollar Advance to an Alternate Base Rate Advance on which
interest and principal shall be payable contemporaneously, and on a pro rata
basis, with the related Eurodollar Advances of the other Lenders, (ii) in the
case of a LIBOR Competitive Advance, prepay in full the then outstanding
principal amount of such LIBOR Competitive Advance, together with accrued
interest thereon, and such Lender shall concurrently make an Alternate Base
Rate Advance in an equal Dollar Amount to the relevant Borrower (interest and
principal on such Alternate Base Rate Advance being due at the same times as
were applicable to such LIBOR Competitive Advance) and (iii) in the case of a
Swingline Advance, immediately prepay in full the then outstanding principal
amount of such Swingline Advance, together with accrued interest thereon.

     (c)  If (i) prior to 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the second Business Day
before the first day of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Advance or
LIBOR Competitive Advance or (ii) prior to 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
first day of any Interest Period for any Sterling Swingline Advance, the
relevant Lender reasonably determines that deposits in the applicable currency
in same day funds are not being offered in the London interbank market in the
amount of such Advance for such Interest Period, then, upon notice thereof by
such Lender to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Funding Agent), the
obligation of such Lender to make such Advance or to convert any outstanding
Alternate Base Rate Advance into such Eurodollar Advance or to continue such
Eurodollar Advance for such Interest Period, as the case may be, shall
terminate and (x) upon notice by such Borrower to such Lender (with a copy to
the Funding Agent) not later than 11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the Business
Day next preceding such first day for Eurodollar Advances or LIBOR Competitive
Advances, such proposed Eurodollar Advance or LIBOR Competitive Advance, as
the case may be, shall be made as an Alternate Base Rate Advance and, in the
case of a LIBOR Competitive Advance in an Alternative Currency, shall be made
in Dollars in the same Dollar Amount as the requested LIBOR Competitive
Advance and shall bear interest for each day from and including the first day
to but excluding the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto at the
Alternate Base Rate for such day, or (y) such Lender's Swingline Advance shall
not be made, as the case may be.

     SECTION 2.06.  Interest Elections.  (a)  The Contractual Advances
included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate
specified by the Borrower in the applicable Notice of Borrowing.  Thereafter,
the Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of
interest rate borne by each Group of Contractual Advances (subject to Section
2.06(d) and Section 2.05), as follows:

         (i)  if such Advances are Alternate Base Rate Advances, the Borrower
may elect to convert such Advances to Eurodollar Advances as of any Business
Day; and

         (ii)  if such Advances are Eurodollar Advances, the Borrower may
elect to convert such Advances to Alternate Base Rate Advances or elect to
continue such Advances as Eurodollar Advances for an additional Interest
Period, subject to Section 10.05(b) if any such conversion is effective on any
day other than the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such Advances.

To make an election pursuant to this Section, a Borrower shall notify the
Funding Agent thereof by telephone (confirmed immediately in writing) or by
telex or facsimile (a "Notice of Interest Rate Election") by the time that a
Notice of Borrowing would be required under Section 2.01(d) if such Borrower
were requesting a Contractual Advance of the type resulting from such election
to be made on the effective date of such election.  Each such Notice of
Interest Rate of Election shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit B-2
and signed by such Borrower.  A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so
specifies, apply to only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the
relevant Group of Contractual Advances; provided that (i) such portion is
allocated ratably among the Advances comprising such Group and (ii) the
portion to which such Notice applies, and the remaining portion to which it
does not apply, are each at least $25,000,000 (unless such portion is
comprised of Alternate Base Rate Advances).  If no such notice is timely
received before the end of an Interest Period for any Group of Eurodollar
Advances, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected that such Group of
Eurodollar Advances be converted to Alternate Base Rate Advances at the end of
such Interest Period.

     (b)  Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:

         (i)   the Group of Contractual Advances (or portion thereof) to which
such notice applies;

         (ii)  whether such Group of Contractual Advances (or portion thereof)
is to be converted to the other Type of Contractual Advances or, in the case
of Eurodollar Advances, continued as Eurodollar Advances for an additional
Interest Period;

         (iii) the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in
such notice is to be effective, which shall comply with the applicable clause
of Section 2.06(a) above;

         (iv)  if the Advances comprising such Group (or portions thereof) are
to be converted to Eurodollar Advances, the duration of the initial Interest
Period applicable thereto; and

         (v)   if such Advances (or portions thereof) are to be continued as
Eurodollar Advances for an additional Interest Period, the duration of such
additional Interest Period.

Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall
comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

     (c)  Promptly after receiving a Notice of Interest Rate Election from a
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.06(a) above, the Funding Agent shall notify
each Lender of the contents thereof.

     (d)  No Borrower shall be entitled to elect to convert any Alternate Base
Rate Advances to Eurodollar Advances, or continue any Eurodollar Advances for
an additional Interest Period, if (i) the aggregate principal amount of any
Group of Eurodollar Advances created or continued as a result of such election
would be less than $25,000,000 or (ii) an Event of Default or an event that
would constitute an Event of Default but for the requirement that notice be
given or time elapse or both shall have occurred and be continuing when the
Borrower delivers notice of such election to the Funding Agent.

     SECTION 2.07.  Fees.  (a)  Xerox agrees to pay to the Funding Agent for
the account of each Lender a facility fee at the applicable Facility Fee Rate
(determined for each day in accordance with the Pricing Schedule) on the total
amount of such Lender's Commitment, irrespective of usage, from the date on
which this Agreement is fully executed until the Termination Date, payable on
the last day of each March, June, September and December during such period
(the first such payment being due on December 31, 1997) and on the Termination
Date.

     (b)  Xerox shall pay to each Agent, for its own account, such other fees
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein as
such Agent and Xerox shall have agreed in writing.

     SECTION 2.08.  Termination or Reduction of Commitments.

     (a)  Xerox may, upon at least two Business Days' notice to the Funding
Agent (which notice the Funding Agent shall promptly transmit to each Lender),
terminate the Commitments in whole or reduce the Commitments ratably in part;
provided that (i) each partial reduction shall be in the amount of $10,000,000
or an integral multiple thereof, (ii) immediately after any such reduction or
termination of the Commitments, the aggregate Dollar Amount of all Outstanding
Advances shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the Commitments and (iii)
simultaneously with each such reduction or with a termination of the
Commitments, Xerox shall pay to the Funding Agent the facility fee accrued on
the amount of the Commitment so terminated or reduced through the date
thereof, together with any reimbursement payable pursuant to Section 10.05(b).
Unless previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the
Termination Date.

     (b)  Xerox may, upon at least two Business Days' notice to the Funding
Agent (which notice the Funding Agent shall promptly transmit to the relevant
Swingline Banks), terminate in whole or reduce ratably in part the French
Franc Swingline Commitments or the Sterling Swingline Commitments; provided that
(i) each partial reduction shall be in the amount of $10,000,000 or an
integral multiple thereof and (ii) immediately after any such reduction or
termination, the aggregate Dollar Amount of all outstanding French Franc
Swingline Advances or Sterling Swingline Advances, as the case may be, shall
not exceed the aggregate amount of the French Franc Swingline Commitments or
Sterling Swingline Commitments, as the case may be.  Unless previously
terminated, all the Swingline Commitments shall terminate on the Swingline
Termination Date.

     SECTION 2.09.  Repayment at Maturity.  (a)  The Contractual Advances
shall mature, and be due and payable, on the Termination Date.  On the
Termination Date each Borrower shall repay to the Funding Agent for the
account of the Lenders the aggregate principal amount of all Contractual
Advances then outstanding to such Borrower (and all interest accrued thereon).

     (b)  The Swingline Advances included in each Swingline Borrowing shall
mature, and be due and payable, on the last day of the Interest Period for
such Swingline Borrowing.  On the last day of the Interest Period for each
French Franc Swingline Borrowing, the relevant Borrower shall repay to each
French Franc Swingline Bank the principal amount of its Swingline Advance
included in such Swingline Borrowing (and all interest accrued thereon).  On
the last day of the Interest Period for each Sterling Swingline Borrowing, the
relevant Borrower shall repay to the Funding Agent for the account of the
Sterling Swingline Banks the aggregate principal amount of such Swingline
Borrowing (and all interest accrued thereon).

     (c)  The Competitive Advances included in each Competitive Bid Borrowing
shall mature, and be due and payable, on the last day of the Interest Period
for such Competitive Bid Borrowing.  On the last day of the Interest Period
for each Competitive Bid Borrowing, the relevant Borrower shall repay to the
Funding Agent for the account of the relevant Lenders the aggregate principal
amount of such Competitive Bid Borrowing (and all interest accrued thereon).

     SECTION 2.10.  Interest.  Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Advance made by each Lender to such Borrower from the
date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the
following rates per annum:

     (a)  Eurodollar Advances.  A rate per annum equal at all times during
each Interest Period for such Advance to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest
Period.

     (b)  Alternate Base Rate Advances.  A rate per annum equal to the
Alternate Base Rate in effect from time to time.

     (c)  Swingline Advances.  A rate per annum equal at all times during the
Interest Period for such Advance to the Swingline Rate for such Interest
Period.

     (d)  Competitive Advances.  A rate per annum equal at all times during
the Interest Period for such Competitive Advance to the Competitive Bid Rate
for such Competitive Advance.

     (e)  Default Rate.  In the case of each of (a), (b), (c) and (d) above,
if  any amount of principal is not paid when due (whether at stated maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise), such amount shall bear interest, from the date
on which such amount is due until such amount is paid in full, at the Default
Rate as in effect from time to time.

Interest on each Advance shall be payable in the currency of such Advance.
Accrued interest on each Advance shall be payable on each Interest Payment
Date and on the date of repayment of such Advance; provided that interest
payable at the Default Rate shall be payable from time to time on demand.

     SECTION 2.11.  Reserve Costs.  (a)  Each Borrower shall pay to the
Funding Agent for the account of each Lender, so long as such Lender shall be
required under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting
of or including Eurocurrency Liabilities, additional interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurodollar Advance or Swingline Advance which is made
to such Borrower by such Lender and is included in the calculation of its
Eurocurrency Liabilities, from the date of such Advance until such Advance is
paid in full or (in the case of a Eurodollar Advance) is converted to an
Alternate Base Rate Advance, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times
during the Interest Period for such Advance to the remainder obtained by
subtracting (i) the LIBO Rate or Swingline Base Rate for such Interest Period
from (ii) the rate obtained by multiplying such LIBO Rate or Swingline Base
Rate by the Statutory Reserves applicable to such Lender for such Interest
Period.

     (b)  If and so long as any Sterling Swingline Lender is required to make
special deposits with the Bank of England or to maintain reserve asset ratios
in respect of such Lender's Sterling Swingline Advances to any Borrower, such
Lender may require such Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment
of interest on each of such Lender's Sterling Swingline Advances to such
Borrower, additional interest on such Advances at a rate per annum equal to
such Lender's MLA Cost calculated in accordance with the formula and in the
manner set forth in Exhibit H hereto.

     (c)  If and so long as any Lender is required to comply with reserve
assets, liquidity, cash margin or other requirements of any monetary or other
authority (excluding requirements referred to in subsections (a) and (b)
above) in respect of any of such Lender's Eurodollar Advances or Swingline
Advances, such Lender may require each Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with
each payment of interest on each of such Lender's Eurodollar Advances or
Swingline Advances subject to such requirements, additional interest on such
Advance at a rate per annum specified by such Lender to be the cost to such
Lender of complying with such requirements in relation to such Advance.

     (d)  Any additional interest owed pursuant to subsections (a), (b) or (c)
above shall be determined by the relevant Lender, which determination shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes except in the case of manifest error,
and notified to the relevant Borrower (with a copy to the Funding Agent) not
later than five Business Days before the next Interest Payment Date for each
relevant Advance, and such additional interest so notified to such Borrower by
such Lender shall be payable to the Funding Agent (or the relevant French
Franc Swingline Bank, in the case of additional interest on a French Franc
Swingline Advance) for the account of such Lender on each Interest Payment
Date for such Advance.

     (e)  If any Borrower so notifies any Lender (with a copy to the Funding
Agent) within two Business Days after such Lender demands from such Borrower
any additional interest with respect to any Eurodollar Advance pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section attributable to any reserve requirements
other than those either in effect on the date hereof or scheduled on the date
hereof to become effective in the future, such Borrower may, on the day on
which such additional interest is payable, prepay in full all Eurodollar
Advances of such Lender then outstanding, together, in the case of a
prepayment, with interest accrued thereon (including, but not limited to, such
additional interest), in accordance with Section 2.12, together with any
reimbursement payable pursuant to Section 10.05(b).  If such Lender
subsequently notifies such Borrower and the Funding Agent that the
circumstances giving rise to such demand for additional interest no longer
exist, such Lender shall, on the first day of the next succeeding Interest
Period for each related Group of Contractual Advances, make a Eurodollar
Advance to such Borrower in an amount equal to the amount of such Lender's
Advance that would have been outstanding as part of such Group if such Advance
had not been prepaid pursuant to this subsection.

     SECTION 2.12.  Prepayments.  (a)  A Borrower may, upon at least three
Business Days' (or, in the case of Alternate Base Rate Advances, one Business
Day's) notice to the Funding Agent (which notice the Funding Agent shall
promptly transmit to each Lender) stating the proposed date and aggregate
principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given, such Borrower
shall, prepay any Group of Contractual Advances in whole or ratably in part,
together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount
prepaid; provided that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate
principal amount not less than $25,000,000 and (ii) if the Advances prepaid
are Eurodollar Advances, such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 10.05(b).

     (b)  A Borrower may, upon at least one Business Day's notice to the
Funding Agent (which notice the Funding Agent shall promptly transmit to the
relevant Swingline Banks) stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given, such Borrower shall,
prepay any Swingline Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid;
provided that (i) each partial prepayment shall be in a Dollar Amount not less
than $5,000,000 and (ii) such Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse the
relevant Swingline Banks in respect thereof pursuant to Section 10.05(b).

     (c)  A Borrower may not prepay all or any portion of any Competitive
Advance prior to the maturity thereof.

     (d)  Each notice referred to in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section
shall be irrevocable and binding on the Borrower giving such notice and, in
respect of any Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Advances or Swingline
Advances specified in such notice, such Borrower shall indemnify each Lender
against any loss or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure
to prepay on the date specified in such notice the entire amount to be prepaid
as stated in such notice.

     SECTION 2.13.  Increased Costs; Change in Circumstances.  (a)  If, due to
either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change by way of
imposition or increase of reserve requirements, in the case of Eurodollar
Advances or Swingline Advances, for which a Lender is entitled to compensation
during the relevant Interest Period under Section 2.11) in or in the
interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be a net increase in the
cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining
Eurodollar Advances, LIBOR Competitive Advances or Swingline Advances made to
any Borrower, or any reduction in amounts which such Lender would otherwise be
entitled to receive on account thereof, then such Borrower shall from time to
time, upon demand by such Lender, pay to such Lender additional amounts
sufficient to reimburse such Lender for such increased cost or reduction
(collectively "increased costs"); provided that

          (i)  this subsection (a) shall not apply to any such introduction,
change, guideline or request (x) that occurs prior to the date hereof or, with
respect to any Competitive Advance, prior to the date of the related
Competitive Bid or (y) that imposes or increases the amount of any Tax or
Other Tax (or any tax expressly excluded from the definition of "Taxes" in
Section 2.14);

         (ii)  if such Lender shall fail to notify Xerox of any such
introduction, change, guideline or request within 30 days after such Lender
obtains actual knowledge thereof, such Lender shall not be entitled to be
reimbursed for any related increased cost incurred more than 30 days before
such Lender does notify Xerox thereof; and

         (iii) such Lender shall use its best efforts to make, fund or
maintain such Eurodollar Advances, LIBOR Competitive Advances or Swingline
Advances through another Applicable Lending Office of such Lender if the
increased costs payable pursuant to this Section would thereby be reduced and
if the making, funding or maintenance of such Advances through such other
Applicable Lending Office of such Lender does not, in the reasonable
discretion of such Lender, otherwise adversely affect such Lender.

The amount of increased costs from time to time payable by any Borrower to any
Lender under this Section shall be determined in good faith by such Lender on
a basis which allocates such increased costs incurred by such Lender in
connection with the making, funding or maintaining of advances made by such
Lender to any borrowers, ratably among such borrowers.

     (b)  If any Lender shall have determined that the applicability of any
law, rule, regulation or guideline adopted after the date hereof pursuant to
or arising out of the July 1988 report of the Basle Committee on Banking
Regulations and Supervisory Practices entitled "Agreement on International
Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards", or the adoption
after the date hereof of any other law, rule, regulation or guideline
regarding capital adequacy, or any change after the date hereof in any of the
foregoing or in the interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing
by any government authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender (or
the Applicable Lending Office of such Lender) or any Lender's holding company
with any request or directive made subsequent to the date hereof regarding
capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such
Lender's holding company, if any, as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding
company could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance
(taking into consideration such Lender's policies on capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to time the
Borrowers shall pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction
accruing from and after the date of such adoption or change.  Such Lender
hereby agrees to provide to the Borrowers notice of any such adoption or
change, such notice to be sent promptly but in no event later than 45 days
after such adoption or change.

     (c)  A certificate as to the amount of increased cost under Section
2.13(a) above, showing in reasonable detail the determination of the amount of
compensation claimed, submitted to a Borrower by a Lender, shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes except in the case of manifest error.  If any
Borrower so notifies any Lender (with a copy to the Funding Agent) within five
Business Days after such Lender demands from such Borrower any increased cost
with respect to Eurodollar Advances pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section, such Borrower may prepay in full all Eurodollar Advances of such
Lender then outstanding to such Borrower (together with interest accrued
thereon), in accordance with Section 2.12, together with the reimbursement for
such cost in accordance with this Section and Section 10.05(b).  If such
Lender notifies such Borrower and the Funding Agent that the circumstances
giving rise to such demand for compensation no longer exist, such Lender
shall, on the first day of the next succeeding Interest Period for each
related Group of Eurodollar Advances, make a Eurodollar Advance to such
Borrower in an amount equal to the amount that would have been outstanding as
part of such Group if such Advance had not been prepaid pursuant to this
subsection.

     (d)  A certificate as to the amount of compensation claimed by a Lender
under Section 2.13(b) above, showing in reasonable detail the determination of
the amount of compensation claimed, submitted to a Borrower by a Lender, shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes except in the case of manifest
error.  If a Lender makes a claim for compensation under Section 2.13(b)
above, Xerox shall have the right to replace such Lender with a new Lender
which shall be acceptable to the Majority Lenders and shall assume the
Commitment and Swingline Commitment (if any) and purchase the outstanding
Contractual Advances and Swingline Advances (if any) of the Lender being
replaced, provided that if the replacement of any Lender shall result in the
purchase of any Eurodollar Advance or Swingline Advance from such Lender other
than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto, the relevant
Borrower shall reimburse such Lender in accordance with Section 10.05(b).

     SECTION 2.14.  Taxes.  (a)  Subject to the last sentence of Section 2.17,
any and all payments by each Borrower hereunder or under the Notes of such
Borrower shall be made, in accordance with the next succeeding Section, free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
levies, imposts, deductions, charges or withholdings, and all liabilities with
respect thereto, excluding:

         (i)   in the case of each Lender and the Funding Agent, taxes imposed
on its overall net income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the
jurisdiction under the laws of which such Lender or the Funding Agent (as the
case may be) is organized or any political subdivision thereof,

         (ii)  in the case of each Lender, taxes imposed on its overall net
income, and franchise taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction of such
Lender's Applicable Lending Office or any political subdivision thereof,

         (iii) taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings, and liabilities with respect thereto, imposed on payments in
respect of any Competitive Advance under laws and treaties applicable on the
date of the related Competitive Bid (collectively, "Pre-Existing Law"), and

         (iv)  in the case of each Lender, any United States withholding tax
imposed on any such payments (other than payments in respect of Swingline
Advances), but only to the extent that such Lender would have been subject to
United States withholding tax on such payments under applicable laws and
treaties in effect when such Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement

(all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges,
withholdings and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes").  If
any Borrower shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from or in respect
of any sum payable hereunder or under any Note to any Lender or the Funding
Agent, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as may be necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums payable under this Section) such Lender or the Funding Agent
(as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have
received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such
deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable
law.

     (b)  In addition, each Borrower agrees to pay any present or future stamp
or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar
levies of any jurisdiction (except those imposed in respect of a Competitive
Advance under Pre-Existing Law) which arise from any payment made hereunder or
under the Notes of such Borrower or from the execution, delivery or
registration of, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement, such Notes or
any other documents to be delivered hereunder (hereinafter referred to as
"Other Taxes").

     (c)  Each Borrower will indemnify each Lender and the Funding Agent for
the full amount of Taxes or Other Taxes (including without limitation, any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts payable under this
Section) paid by such Lender or the Funding Agent (as the case may be) or any
liability (including penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly
or legally asserted.  This indemnification shall be made within 30 days from
the date such Lender or the Funding Agent (as the case may be) makes written
demand therefor.

     (d)  Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes in respect of
any payment to any Lender or the Funding Agent hereunder, the Borrower will
furnish to such Lender or the Funding Agent (as the case may be) the original
or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.  Within 30 days
after any Lender or the Funding Agent has actual knowledge of (i) the
imposition of any Taxes or Other Taxes applicable to it or (ii) the assertion
by any taxing authority of liability for any Taxes or Other Taxes applicable
to it, such Lender or the Funding Agent (as the case may be) will notify the
relevant Borrowers of such Taxes or Other Taxes.

     (e)  If a Lender makes a claim for compensation under this Section, Xerox
shall have the right to replace such Lender with a new Lender which shall be
acceptable to the Majority Lenders and shall assume the Commitment and
Swingline Commitment (if any) and purchase the outstanding Contractual
Advances and Swingline Advances (if any) of the Lender being replaced,
provided that if the replacement of any Lender shall result in the purchase of
any Eurodollar Advance or Swingline Advance from such Lender other than on the
last day of an Interest Period, the relevant Borrower shall reimburse such
Lender in accordance with Section 10.05(b).

     (f)  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the
Borrowers hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrowers contained
in this Section shall survive the payment in full of principal and interest
hereunder and under the Notes and the termination of this Agreement.

     SECTION 2.15.  Payments and Computation.  (a)  Each Borrower shall,
without set off, counterclaim or deduction of any kind, make each payment to
be made by it hereunder and under the Notes of such Borrower

         (i)   in the case of Dollar-Denominated Advances, not later than
11:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the day when due in Dollars and in same day funds
at the Chicago Office of the Funding Agent;

         (ii)  in the case of Sterling Swingline Advances, not later than
12:00 noon (London time) on the day when due in Pounds Sterling and in same
day funds at the London Office of the Funding Agent;

         (iii) in the case of each French Franc Swingline Advance, not later
than 12:00 noon (Paris time) on the day when due in French Francs and in same
day funds at the Swingline Lending Office of the relevant French Franc
Swingline Bank; and

         (iv)  in the case of any Competitive Advance in an Alternative
Currency, on the day when due in such Alternative Currency in such funds as
may then be customary for the settlement of international transactions in such
Alternative Currency, for the account of the Funding Agent at such time and at
such place as shall have been specified by the Funding Agent by notice to the
relevant Borrower and the relevant Lenders at least four Business Days prior
to the date of such payment.

The Funding Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its ratable share of
each such payment received by the Funding Agent for the account of the
Lenders.

     (b)  All computations of interest based on the Alternate Base Rate or the
Default Rate when such Rates are based on the Prime Rate shall be made on the
basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be.  All computations of
interest on Advances in Pounds Sterling based on the LIBO Rate shall be made
on the basis of a year of 365 days.  All computations of interest on Fixed
Rate Competitive Advances or based on the Alternate Base Rate or the Default
Rate when such Rates are based on the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (except
in the case of Advances in Pounds Sterling) based on the LIBO Rate [or the
TMP] and all computations of facility fees shall be made on the basis of a
year of 360 days.  In each case interest shall be computed for the actual
number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring
in the period for which such interest or facility fees are payable.  Each
computation by the Funding Agent of interest or fees hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, in the absence of manifest error.

     (c)  Whenever any payment hereunder or under any Note shall be stated to
be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or facility fees, as the
case may be; provided that if such extension would cause payment of interest
on or principal of Eurodollar Advances or LIBOR Competitive Advances to be
made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the
next preceding Business Day.

     SECTION 2.16.  Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender shall obtain any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) on account of the principal of or interest on the
Advances (other than Swingline Advances) made by it to any Borrower in excess
of its ratable share (determined on the basis of the unpaid principal of, or
interest on, the Advances (other than Swingline Advances) then due and payable
by such Borrower to any other Lender or Lenders) of payments on account of the
principal of or interest on such Advances (other than Swingline Advances)
obtained by any other Lender or Lenders (other than pursuant to Sections 2.11,
2.13, 2.14, 2.20, 2.22 or 10.05(b)), such Lender shall forthwith purchase from
each such other Lender such participations as shall be necessary to cause such
purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them;
provided that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be
rescinded and each such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.
Disproportionate payments of interest shall be shared by the purchase of
separate participations in unpaid interest obligations, and disproportionate
payments of principal shall be shared by the purchase of separate
participations in unpaid principal obligations.  Each Borrower agrees that any
Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this
Section may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights
of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the
amount of such participation.

     SECTION 2.17.  Exemption from United States Withholding.  Each Lender
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall
provide the Funding Agent and the U.S. Borrowers with the forms prescribed by
the Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying as to whether
such Lender is exempt from United States withholding taxes, or subject to such
taxes at a rate reduced by an applicable tax treaty, with respect to all
payments to be made to such Lender hereunder and under the Notes.  Such forms
shall be so provided (i) prior to the date of the initial Borrowing hereunder
(but in any event not later than October 31, 1997), in the case of a Lender
listed on the signature pages hereof, (ii) on or prior to the date when it
first becomes a Lender hereunder, in the case of a Lender not listed on the
signature pages hereof, and (iii) in either case from time to time thereafter
if requested by a U.S. Borrower or the Funding Agent (but only so long as such
Lender remains lawfully able to do so).  Unless the U.S. Borrowers and the
Funding Agent have received forms or other documents satisfactory to them
indicating that payments hereunder or under any Note are not subject to United
States withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate reduced by an
applicable tax treaty, the U.S. Borrowers or the Funding Agent may withhold
taxes from such payments at the applicable statutory rate in the case of
payments to or for any Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States.

     SECTION 2.18.  Judgment Currency.  If for the purpose of obtaining
judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower
hereunder or under any Note in the currency expressed to be payable herein
(the "specified currency") into another currency, the parties hereto agree, to
the fullest extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange
used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Funding Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency
at the Funding Agent's Chicago Office on the Business Day preceding the day on
which final judgment is given.  The obligations of each Borrower in respect of
any sum due to any Lender or the Funding Agent hereunder or under any Note
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified
currency, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following
receipt by such Lender or the Funding Agent (as the case may be) of any sum
adjudged to be so due in such other currency, such Lender or the Funding Agent
(as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase
the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the
specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such
Lender or the Funding Agent, as the case may be, in the specified currency,
each Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent that it may effectively do so, as
a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such
Lender or the Funding Agent, as the case may be, against such loss.  If the
amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds (a) the sum originally
due to any Lender or the Funding Agent, as the case may be, in the specified
currency and (b) any amounts shared with other Lenders as a result of
allocations of such excess as a disproportionate payment to such Lender under
Section 2.16, such Lender or the Funding Agent, as the case may be, agrees to
remit such excess to the appropriate Borrower.

     SECTION 2.19.  Designation of Overseas Borrower and Swingline Borrower;
Termination of Designations.  (a)  Xerox may from time to time designate any
Wholly-Owned Overseas Subsidiary as an Overseas Borrower for purposes of this
Agreement by delivering to the Funding Agent an Election to Participate duly
executed on behalf of such Subsidiary and Xerox in such number of copies as
the Funding Agent may request.  The Funding Agent shall promptly notify the
Lenders of its receipt of any such Election to Participate.

     (b)  Xerox may at any time terminate the status of any Subsidiary as an
Overseas Borrower for purposes of this Agreement by delivering to the Funding
Agent an Election to Terminate duly executed on behalf of such Subsidiary and
Xerox in such number of copies as the Funding Agent may request.  The delivery
of such an Election to Terminate shall not affect any obligation of such
Subsidiary theretofore incurred under this Agreement and its Notes or any
rights of the Lenders and the Agents against such Subsidiary or against Xerox
in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of such Subsidiary.  The
Funding Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of its receipt of any such
Election to Terminate

     (c)  Xerox hereby designates each of Xerox Capital (Europe) and Xerox
Overseas as a Borrower eligible to borrow French Franc Swingline Advances
hereunder (a "French Franc Swingline Borrower").  Xerox may from time to time,
by notice to the Funding Agent, designate any other Overseas Borrower as a
French Franc Swingline Borrower.  Such notice of designation shall include a
representation that the representation and warranty contained in Section
8.01(e) is, except as disclosed in such notice, true and correct as of the
date of such notice with respect to French Franc Swingline Advances to such
Borrower.  Xerox may at any time terminate the status of any Overseas Borrower
as a French Franc Swingline Borrower by delivering notice of such termination
to the Funding Agent.  The delivery of such notice shall not affect any
obligation of such Overseas Borrower theretofore incurred under this Agreement
or any rights of the Lenders and the Agents against such Overseas Borrower or
against Xerox in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of such Overseas
Borrower.  Promptly upon receiving any such notice of designation or
termination, the Funding Agent shall notify the Lenders of the contents
thereof.

     (d)  Xerox hereby designates each of Xerox Capital (Europe) and Xerox
Overseas as a Borrower eligible to borrow Sterling Swingline Advances
hereunder (a "Sterling Swingline Borrower").  Xerox may from time to time, by
notice to the Funding Agent, designate any other Overseas Borrower as a
Sterling Swingline Borrower.  Such notice of designation shall include a
representation that the representation and warranty contained in Section
8.01(e) is, except as disclosed in such notice, true and correct as of the
date of such notice with respect to Sterling Swingline Advances to such
Borrower.  Xerox may at any time terminate the status of any Overseas Borrower
as a Sterling Swingline Borrower by delivering notice of such termination to
the Funding Agent.  The delivery of such notice shall not affect any
obligation of such Overseas Borrower theretofore incurred under this Agreement
or any rights of the Lenders and the Agents against such Overseas Borrower or
against Xerox in its capacity as guarantor of the obligations of such Overseas
Borrower.  Promptly upon receiving any such notice of designation or
termination, the Funding Agent shall notify the Lenders of the contents
thereof.

     SECTION 2.20.  Overseas Borrower Costs.  (a)  If the cost to any Lender
of making or maintaining any Advance to an Overseas Borrower (other than Xerox
Capital (Europe) and Xerox Overseas) is increased (or the amount of any sum
received or receivable by any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office is
reduced) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the
fact that such Overseas Borrower is incorporated in, or conducts business in,
a jurisdiction outside the United States, such Borrower shall indemnify such
Lender for such increased cost or reduction within 15 days after demand by
such Lender (with a copy to the Funding Agent).  The foregoing indemnity shall
not apply to any Taxes or to any taxes expressly excluded from the definition
of "Taxes" in Section 2.14(a).  A certificate of such Lender claiming
compensation under this Section and setting forth the additional amount or
amounts to be paid to it hereunder shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error.

      (b)  Each Lender will promptly notify the relevant Overseas Borrower and
the Funding Agent of any event or circumstance of which it has knowledge that
will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of,
such compensation and will not be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

     SECTION 2.21.  Determining Dollar Amounts of Alternative Currency
Advances.  The Funding Agent shall determine the Dollar Amount of each
Alternative Currency Advance promptly after it receives the related Notice of
Borrowing, based on the Spot Rate on the day it receives such notice.
Thereafter, the Agent shall redetermine the Dollar Amount of each Alternative
Currency Advance on the fourth Business Day before the end of each calendar
month while such Advance remains outstanding, based in each case on the Spot
Rate on such Business Day. The Funding Agent shall promptly notify Xerox and
the relevant Borrower (if other than Xerox) and the participating Lenders of
each Dollar Amount so determined, and its determination thereof shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

     SECTION 2.22.  Refunding Unpaid Swingline Advances.  (a)  If any
Swingline Borrowing shall not be repaid in full at or prior to the maturity
thereof, the Funding Agent shall, on behalf of Xerox pursuant to its guaranty
in Article 9, (Xerox hereby irrevocably directing and authorizing the Funding
Agent so to act on its behalf) give a Notice of Borrowing requesting the
Lenders, including the Swingline Banks in their capacities as Lenders, to make
Alternate Base Rate Advances in the aggregate amount (subject to subsection
(d) below) required to enable the Funding Agent to purchase the French Francs
or Pounds Sterling required to repay such Swingline Borrowing (together with
any unpaid interest accrued thereon).  The Funding Agent shall, on behalf of
Xerox (Xerox hereby irrevocably directing and authorizing the Funding Agent so
to act on its behalf) enter into a transaction to purchase such French Francs
or Pounds Sterling with the proceeds of such Alternate Base Rate Advances.
Each Lender will make the proceeds of its Alternate Base Rate Advance included
in such Borrowing available to the Funding Agent for the account of Xerox on
the next Business Day after the date of such notice, in accordance with
Section 2.04.  The French Francs or Pounds Sterling purchased with the
proceeds of such Alternate Base Rate Borrowing shall be immediately (upon
settlement of such currency transaction) applied to repay such Swingline
Borrowing.

     (b)  If, for any reason, an Alternate Base Rate Borrowing may not be (as
determined by the Funding Agent in its sole discretion), or is not, made
pursuant to subsection (a) above to refund Swingline Advances as required by
said subsection, then, effective on the date such Borrowing would otherwise
have been made, each Lender severally, unconditionally and irrevocably agrees
that it shall purchase an undivided participating interest in such Swingline
Advances (each, an "Unrefunded Swingline Advance") in an amount (subject to
subsection (d) below) equal to its Commitment Percentage of the outstanding
principal amount thereof, which purchase shall be funded by the time such
Borrowing would have been required to be funded pursuant to Section 2.04 by
transferring (i) in the case of a Sterling Swingline Advance, Pounds Sterling
in same day funds to the Funding Agent at its London Office or (ii) in the
case of a French Franc Swingline Advance, French Francs in same day funds to
the relevant French Franc Swingline Bank at its Swingline Lending Office.

     (c)  Whenever, at any time after any Swingline Bank has received from any
Lender payment in full for such Lender's participating interest in a Swingline
Advance, such Swingline Bank (or the Funding Agent on its behalf) receives any
payment on account thereof, such Swingline Bank or the Funding Agent, as the
case may be, will promptly distribute to such Lender its participating
interest in such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest
payments, to reflect the period of time during which such Lender's
participating interest was outstanding and funded); provided that, if such
payment is subsequently required to be returned, such Lender will return to
the relevant Swingline Bank or the Funding Agent, as the case may be, any
portion thereof previously distributed by such Swingline Bank or the Funding
Agent, as the case may be, to it.

     (d)  No Lender shall be obligated to make an Alternate Base Rate Advance
pursuant to subsection (a) above in an amount greater than the unused portion
of its Commitment at the time such Advance is required to be made.  No Lender
shall be required to purchase a participating interest pursuant to subsection
(b) above in an amount greater than the amount of French Francs or Pounds
Sterling (as the case may be) which is equivalent (at the Spot Rate on the day
of such purchase) to the unused portion of its Commitment at the time such
purchase is required to be made.  In determining the unused portion of a
Lender's Commitment for purposes of this subsection (d), any termination of
the Commitments pursuant to Section 6.01 shall be ignored.

     (e)  Except as provided in subsection (d) above, each Lender's obligation
to make Alternate Base Rate Advances or to purchase participating interests
pursuant to this Section shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be
affected by any circumstance, including, without limitation:  (i) any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender or any
Borrower may have against any Swingline Bank or any other Person for any
reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of any Event of Default
or event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the conditions
specified in Article 3; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial
or otherwise) of any Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any
Borrower or any Lender; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event
whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

     SECTION 2.23.  Substitution of Euro for National Currency.  If any
Alternative Currency is replaced by the Euro, the Euro may be tendered in
payment of any outstanding amount denominated in such Alternative Currency at
the conversion rate specified in, or otherwise calculated in accordance with,
the regulations adopted by the Council of the European Union relating to the
Euro.  If either French Francs or Pounds Sterling are replaced by the Euro,
Xerox, the Funding Agent and the French Franc Swingline Banks (if the affected
currency is French Francs) or the Sterling Swingline Banks (if the affected
currency is Pounds Sterling) may enter into an amendment of this Agreement
modifying the provisions hereof relating to Swingline Advances in the affected
currency to reflect the replacement thereof by the Euro.  Except as provided
in the foregoing provisions of this Section, no replacement of an Alternative
Currency by the Euro shall discharge, excuse or otherwise affect the
performance of any obligation of any Borrower under this Agreement or its
Notes.

                                 ARTICLE 7

                                 THE AGENTS

      SECTION 7.01.  Authorization and Action.  The general administration of
this Agreement and the Notes shall be by the Funding Agent and, to the extent
provided in Article 3, the Documentation Agent.  Each Lender hereby
irrevocably authorizes the Funding Agent and the Documentation Agent, each
acting at its discretion, to take or refrain from taking such actions as agent
on such Lender's behalf and to exercise or refrain from exercising such powers
under this Agreement and the Notes as are delegated to the Funding Agent or
the Documentation Agent, as the case may be, by the terms hereof or thereof,
as appropriate, together with all powers reasonably incidental thereto.  Such
Agents shall have no duties or responsibilities except as set forth herein or
in the Notes.

     SECTION 7.02.  Agents' Reliance, Etc.  Neither any Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, agents or employees shall be liable for any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it or them under or in connection with this
Agreement, except for its or their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct.
Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, each Agent:  (i) may
treat the payee of any Note as the holder thereof until the Funding Agent
receives written notice of the assignment or transfer thereof signed by such
payee and in form satisfactory to the Funding Agent; (ii) may consult with
legal counsel (including counsel for any Borrower), independent public
accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the
advice of such counsel, accountants or experts; (iii) makes no warranty or
representation to any Lender and shall not be responsible to any Lender for
any statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with
this Agreement; (iv) shall not have any duty to ascertain or to inquire as to
the performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions

be delivered to it under Article 3) of this Agreement on the part of any
Borrower or to inspect the property (including the books and records) of any
Borrower; (v) shall not be responsible to any Lender for the due execution,
legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this
Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; and
(vi) shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement by acting
upon any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument in writing (whether
delivered by hand, mail, facsimile or telex) believed by it to be genuine and
signed or sent by the proper party or parties.

     SECTION 7.03.  The Agents and Affiliates.  With respect to its Commitment
and Swingline Commitment, the Advances made by it and the Notes issued to it,
each Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent; and the
term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated,
include each Agent in its individual capacity.  Each Agent and its affiliates
may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as trustee under indentures of,
and generally engage in any kind of business with any Borrower, any of their
respective Subsidiaries and any person or entity who may do business with or
own securities of Xerox or any such Subsidiary, all as if such Agent were not
an Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

     SECTION 7.04.  Lenders' Credit Decisions.  Each Lender acknowledges that
it has, independently and without reliance upon any Arranger, any Agent or any
other Lender and based on the financial statements referred to in Section
4.01(e) and such other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each
Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
any Arranger, any Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.05.  Indemnification.  The Lenders agree to indemnify each
Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers), ratably according to
their respective Commitment Percentages, from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which
may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against such Agent in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by
such Agent under this Agreement, provided that no Lender shall be liable for
any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from
such Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation of
the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agents promptly upon demand
for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees
incurred by the Agents in connection with the preparation, execution,
administration, or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement) to the extent that the Agents are not
reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrowers.

     SECTION 7.06.  Successor Funding Agent.  The Funding Agent may resign at
any time by giving written notice thereof to the Lenders and each Borrower.
Upon any such resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have the right to
appoint a successor Funding Agent.  If no successor Funding Agent shall have
been so appointed by the Majority Lenders, and shall have accepted such
appointment, within 30 days after the retiring Funding Agent gives of notice
of resignation, then the retiring Funding Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Funding Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized
or licensed under the laws of the United States of America or of any State
thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000.
Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Funding Agent hereunder by a
successor Funding Agent, the resignation of the retiring Funding Agent shall
become effective, such successor Funding Agent shall thereupon succeed to and
become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Funding Agent, and the retiring Funding Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under this Agreement.  After any retiring
Funding Agent's resignation, the provisions of this Article 7 shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
Funding Agent under this Agreement.

     SECTION 7.07.  Administrative Questionnaire.  Each Lender agrees to
complete, and return to the Funding Agent, the form of administrative
questionnaire provided by the Funding Agent and to advise the Funding Agent of
any changes in the information provided therein.

     SECTION 7.08.  The Arrangers and Co-Syndication Agents.  The Arrangers,
in their capacities as such, and the Co-Syndication Agents, in their
capacities as such, shall have no duties or responsibilities, and shall incur

     (c)  No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or
filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the

income, stamp or other tax of any country, or any taxing authority thereof or
therein, imposed by or in the nature of withholding or otherwise, which is
imposed on any payment to be made by it pursuant to this Agreement or its
Notes, or is imposed on or by virtue of the execution, delivery or enforcement
of its Election to Participate, this Agreement or its Notes.

                                  ARTICLE 9

                                  GUARANTY

     SECTION 9.01.  The Guaranty.  Xerox hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees the full and punctual payment (whether at stated
maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on
each Advance borrowed by any Overseas Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, and
the full and punctual payment of all other amounts payable by any Overseas
Borrower under this Agreement or its Notes.  Upon failure by any Overseas

Overseas Borrower, or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other
similar proceeding affecting any Overseas Borrower or its assets or any
resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Overseas Borrower
contained in this Agreement or any of its Notes;

     (e)  the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which Xerox may
have at any time against any Overseas Borrower, any Agent, any Lender or any
other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement or any unrelated
transactions; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any
such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;

     (f)  any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any
Overseas Borrower for any reason of this Agreement or any of its Notes, or any
provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment
by any Overseas Borrower of the principal of or interest on any Advances made
to it or any other amount payable by it under this Agreement; or

     (g)  any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any
Overseas Borrower, any Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other
circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this clause
constitute a legal or equitable discharge of Xerox' obligations under this
Article 9.

Certain Circumstances.  Xerox' obligations hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect until the Commitments and Swingline Commitments shall have

of the principal of or interest on any Advance or any other amount payable by
any Overseas Borrower under this Agreement is rescinded or must be otherwise
restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such
Overseas Borrower or otherwise, Xerox' obligations under this Article 9 with
respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as though such
payment had been due but not made at such time.

     SECTION 9.04.  Waiver by Xerox.  Xerox irrevocably waives acceptance
hereof, presentment, demand, protest and any notice not provided for herein,
as well as any requirement that at any time any action be taken by any Person

     SECTION 9.05.  Subrogation.  Upon making any payment with respect to the
obligations of any Overseas Borrower hereunder, Xerox shall be subrogated to
the rights of the payee against such Overseas Borrower with respect to such
payment; provided that Xerox shall not enforce any payment by way of
subrogation against such Overseas Borrower so long as (i) any Lender has any
Commitment or Swingline Commitment hereunder or (ii) any amount payable by
such Overseas Borrower hereunder remains unpaid.

     SECTION 9.06.  Stay of Acceleration.  If acceleration of the time for
payment of any amount payable by any Overseas Borrower under this Agreement or

Overseas Borrower, all such amounts otherwise subject to acceleration under
the terms of this Agreement shall nonetheless be payable by Xerox hereunder
forthwith on demand by the Funding Agent made at the request of the Majority
Lenders.

indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of any Borrower against any and all of the obligations of such
Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement and the Note of such
Borrower held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not any such deposit
or other obligation is then due and payable or is in the same currency or is
booked or otherwise payable at the same office as the obligation against which
it is set off and irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made
any demand under this Agreement or such Note and although such obligations may
be unmatured.  Each Lender agrees promptly to notify such Borrower after any
such set-off and application made by such Lender, provided that the failure to
give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application.  The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-
off) which such Lender may have.

     SECTION 10.07.  Confidentiality.  The Lenders are hereby authorized to
divulge any information pertaining to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby and the records maintained by the Lenders in connection
herewith for the Lenders' own use or to any potential permitted assignee of,
or potential permitted participant in, any Advance or when required or
requested by any governmental, judicial or regulatory authorities in Canada,
the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, the Cayman Islands or any other
jurisdiction to which a Lender is subject.

     SECTION 10.08.  Binding Effect; Governing Law.  This Agreement shall
become effective when all the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01
shall have been satisfied, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of each Borrower, the Arrangers, the Agents and each Lender and
their respective successors and assigns.  This Agreement and the Notes shall
be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

     SECTION 10.09.  Successors and Assigns; Participations.  (a)  Whenever in
this Agreement any of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall
be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such party (provided, that
no Borrower shall have the right to assign its rights or obligations hereunder
or any interest therein without the prior written consent of all the Lenders),
and all covenants, promises and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrowers
which are contained in this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the
successors and assigns of the Lenders.

     (b)  Each Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of
its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment, its Swingline Commitment (if
any) and the Advances at the time owing to it and the Notes held by it);
provided that (i) the U.S. Borrowers and the Funding Agent must give their
prior consent (which consent, in the case of the Funding Agent, shall not be
unreasonably withheld and in the case of the U.S. Borrowers shall be in
writing), except that if an assignee is an affiliate of a Lender, was a Lender
immediately prior to such assignment, or is a Federal Reserve Bank, no such
consent shall be required, (ii) unless the U.S. Borrowers otherwise agree,
each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of
all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and its
Notes, excluding, however, the Lender's rights and obligations with respect to
its Swingline Commitment (if any) and any outstanding Competitive Advances or
Swingline Advances made by it and its Competitive Notes (which outstanding
Competitive Advances and Competitive Notes may, but need not, be assigned in
connection with such assignment), (iii) unless the U.S. Borrowers otherwise
agree, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender subject to each
such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Funding Agent) shall be in a
minimum principal amount of $20,000,000 and an integral multiple of
$5,000,000, (iv) unless the U.S. Borrowers otherwise agree, if any Commitment
is to be retained, the amount of the Commitment retained by such assigning
Lender shall be not less than $10,000,000, (v) the parties to each such
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Funding Agent for its acceptance
and recording in the Register (as defined below), an Assignment and
Acceptance, together with any Note subject to such assignment and a processing
and recordation fee of $2,000 and (vi) the assignee under each such assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Funding Agent a completed administrative
questionnaire in the form provided by the Funding Agent.  Upon such execution,
delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date
specified in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall be not
earlier than five Business Days after the date of acceptance and recording by
the Funding Agent (unless the Funding Agent shall have agreed to a lesser
number of Business Days), (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights
and obligations of a Lender (and, if relevant, a Swingline Bank) hereunder and
(y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent provided in such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this
Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all or
the remaining portion of any assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto).

     (c)  By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance, the Lender
assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree with each
other and the other parties hereto as follows:  (i) other than the
representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner of the
interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim, such
Lender assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with this Agreement or the execution, legality,
validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement
or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto or thereto; (ii)
such Lender assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the Borrowers or the
performance or observance by the Borrowers of any of their obligations under
this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto
or thereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this
Agreement, together with copies of the most recent financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(e) or 5.01(g) and such other documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee
will, independently and without reliance upon any Arranger, any Agent, such
Lender assignor or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Funding Agent to take such action as the
Funding Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement
as are delegated to the Funding Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations
which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a
Lender.

     (d)  The Funding Agent shall maintain at its address at which notices are
to be given to it pursuant to Section 10.02 a copy of each Assignment and
Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment (and Swingline Commitment, if any)
of, and principal amount of the Advances owing to, each Lender from time to
time (the "Register").  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in
the absence of manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Funding Agent and the
Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrowers or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

     (e)  Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed by an
assigning Lender and an assignee together with any Note subject to such
assignment and evidence of the Borrowers' prior written consent (if required),
the Funding Agent shall, if it consents to such assignment and if such
Assignment and Acceptance has been completed and is substantially in the form
of Exhibit G hereto, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record
the information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Borrowers.  Within five Business Days after receipt of the
notice, the Borrowers, at their own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Funding Agent, in exchange for the surrendered Notes, new Notes to the order
of such assignee, and, if the assigning Lender has retained any Commitment
hereunder, replacement Notes to the order of the assigning Lender.  Such new
Notes shall be dated as of the date of the original Notes and shall otherwise
be in substantially the form of Exhibits A-1 and A-2 hereto.

     (f)  Each Lender may without the consent of the Borrowers or the Funding
Agent sell participations to one or more banks or other entities in all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, all or a portion of its Commitment and the Advances owing to it
and the Notes held by it); provided that (i) such Lender's obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) the participating banks or other entities shall be entitled
to (A) the cost protection provisions contained in Sections 2.11, 2.13,
2.14(c), 2.16, 2.20 and 10.05(b) and the right of set-off and other rights
contained in Sections 10.06 and 10.07 and (B) receive the financial statements
referred to in Section 5.01(g) and all other documents and information
furnished to the Lenders by or on behalf of the Borrowers, (iv) such Lender
shall retain the sole right to approve, without the consent of any
participant, any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement other than amendments, modifications or waivers with respect to a
decrease in the amount of principal of or a decrease in the rate of interest
payable on the Advances, or an extension of the date fixed for any payment of
principal of or interest on the Advances, a decrease in the facility fee or
increases in the Commitments and (v) the Borrowers, the Funding Agent and the
other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement.

     (g)  The Borrowers consent that any Lender may at any time and from time
to time pledge or otherwise grant a security interest in any Advance or in any
Note evidencing Advances to any Federal Reserve Bank.

     SECTION 10.10.  Service of Process.  (a) Each Borrower (each a
"Submitting Party") (i) hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the
state courts of the State of New York and to the jurisdiction of the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York, for the purpose
of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this
Agreement or any of such Borrower's Notes, or the subject matter hereof or
thereof, brought by any of the Lenders or the Funding Agent or their
successors or assigns, (ii) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion, as a defense, or otherwise, in any such suit, action or proceeding,
any claim that is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts, that the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the suit, action or proceeding is
improper, or that this Agreement or its Notes or the subject matter hereof or
thereof may not be enforced in or by such court, and (iii) hereby waives any
offsets or counterclaims (other than counterclaims related to transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in any such action, suit or proceeding.  Each
Submitting Party hereby consents to service of process by certified mail at
the address to which notices are to be given to it.  Each Submitting Party
agrees that its submission to jurisdiction and its consent to service of
process by mail is made for the express benefit of the Lenders and the Funding
Agent.  Final judgment against a Submitting Party in any such action, suit or
proceeding shall be conclusive, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions (x)
by suit, action or proceeding on the judgment, a certified or true copy of
which shall be conclusive evidence of the fact and of the amount of any
indebtedness or liability of a Submitting Party therein described or (y) in
any other manner provided by or pursuant to the laws of such other
jurisdiction; provided that the Lenders and the Funding Agent may at their
option bring suit, or institute other judicial proceedings, against any
Submitting Party or any of its assets in any state or federal court of the
United States or of any country or place where such Submitting Party or such
assets may be found.

     (b)  Each Overseas Borrower irrevocably designates and appoints Xerox
Corporation, having an office on the date hereof at Xerox Square, 100 Clinton
Avenue South, Rochester, New York 14644, Attention: General Counsel, as such
Overseas Borrower's authorized agent, to accept and acknowledge on its behalf
service of any and all process which may be served in any suit, action or
proceeding referred to in Section 10.10(a) above in any federal or New York
State court sitting in New York City.  Each Overseas Borrower represents and
warrants that such agent has agreed to accept such appointment.  Said
designation and appointment shall not be revocable by any Overseas Borrower
until the Commitments and Swingline Commitments have terminated and all
principal, interest and other amounts payable by it hereunder shall have been
paid in full in accordance with the provisions hereof.  If such agent shall
cease to act as agent for any Overseas Borrower, such Overseas Borrower agrees
to designate irrevocably and appoint without delay another such agent
satisfactory to the Funding Agent.

     (c)  Each Overseas Borrower consents to process being served in any suit,
action or proceeding referred to in Section 10.10(a) above in any federal or
New York State court sitting in New York City by service of process upon its
agent appointed as provided in Section 10.10(b) above; provided that, to the
extent lawful and possible, notice of said service upon such agent shall be
mailed by registered or certified air mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, to such Overseas Borrower at its address specified in or pursuant
to Section 10.02.  Each Overseas Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, all claim of error by reason of service in such
manner and agrees that such service shall be deemed in every respect effective
service of process upon such Overseas Borrower in any such suit, action or
proceeding and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, constitute valid
and personal service upon and personal delivery to such Overseas Borrower.

     (d)  Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of the Funding Agent
or any Lender to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or limit
the right of the Agent or any Lender to bring proceedings against any Borrower
in the courts of any jurisdiction or jurisdictions.

     SECTION 10.11.  Execution in Counterparts.  This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto in
separate counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original and all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
agreement.

     SECTION 10.12.  Termination of Existing Revolving Credit Agreements.
Each party hereto which is also a party to any Existing Revolving Credit
Agreement (i) agrees that on the Effective Date all commitments of the parties
hereto as lenders under such Existing Revolving Credit Agreement shall
terminate and (ii) waives any requirement under such Existing Revolving Credit
Agreement for any notice of such termination.  Xerox agrees that on the
Effective Date all amounts outstanding and owing under each Existing Revolving
Credit Agreement to each party whose commitment thereunder is being terminated
in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 10.12 (including
principal, accrued and unpaid interest and fees and any other amounts owing
thereunder) shall be paid in full in accordance with the applicable procedures
set forth in such Existing Revolving Credit Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be executed
by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, as of the date first
above written.

on such day.  For purposes of determining the relevant Pricing Level:  (i) if
on any day the rating of any Long-Term Securities by Moody's shall be higher
or lower than the comparable rating by S&P by two or more rating levels (it
being understood that for these purposes an S&P rating of A+ is comparable to
a Moody's rating of A1, an S&P rating of A is comparable to a Moody's rating
of A2, and so forth), then the rating of such Long-Term Securities by each of
Moody's and S&P shall be deemed to be the comparable Moody's and S&P ratings
at the midpoint between the two actual ratings, or, if there shall be no
rating at the midpoint, the next higher rating from the midpoint between the
two actual ratings.  For example, if such Long-Term Securities are rated BBB
by S&P and Ba1 by Moody's, such Long-Term Securities shall be deemed to be
rated BBB- by S&P and Baa3 by Moody's; and if such Long-Term Securities are
rated BBB+ by S&P and Ba1 by Moody's, such debt securities shall be deemed to
be rated BBB by S&P and Baa2 by Moody's.

To the Lenders and Agents
parties to the Credit Agreement
referred to below

                              XEROX CORPORATION
                           XEROX CREDIT CORPORATION
                          XEROX OVERSEAS HOLDINGS PLC
                        RANK XEROX CAPITAL (EUROPE) PLC

Gentlemen:

     This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the
Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 22, 1997 (the "Credit
Agreement"), among Xerox Corporation ("Xerox"), Xerox Credit Corporation
("XCC" and together with Xerox, the "U.S. Borrowers"), the Overseas Borrowers
from time to time party thereto, the Lenders party thereto and the Arrangers
and Agents named therein.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used
herein as therein defined.  The term "Credit Agreement" includes, without
limitation, the guaranty by Xerox in Article 9 thereof and the term "U.S.
Borrower" includes Xerox in its capacity as guarantor thereunder.

     I have acted as counsel for the U.S. Borrowers and for Xerox Overseas and
Xerox Capital (Europe) (the "Initial Overseas Borrowers", and, together with
the U.S. Borrowers, the "Borrowers") in connection with the preparation,
execution and delivery of the Credit Agreement and the Notes of each Borrower
delivered on the date hereof.

     In that connection, either I or other lawyers in the Office of General
Counsel of Xerox who report directly or indirectly to me have examined:

     (a)  The Credit Agreement;

     (b)  The Notes of the Borrowers delivered on the date hereof;

     (c)  The documents furnished pursuant to Section 3.01(b) and (c) of the
Credit Agreement, which include the following:

          (i)  Certified copies of (y) the resolutions of the Board of
Directors of the U.S. Borrowers approving the Credit Agreement and the Notes
of the U.S. Borrowers and (z) all documents evidencing other necessary
corporate action and governmental approvals, if any, with respect to the
Credit Agreement and the Notes of the U.S. Borrowers; and

          (ii)  A certificate of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of
the U.S. Borrowers, certifying the names and true signatures of the officers
of such U.S. Borrowers authorized to sign the Credit Agreement and the Notes
of the U.S. Borrowers and other documents to be delivered by such Borrowers
under the Credit Agreement;

     (d)  The charters of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the
"Charters");

     (e)  The by-laws of the U.S. Borrowers and all amendments thereto (the
"By-Laws"); and

     (f)  Such other documents, agreements and instruments, and such laws,
rules, regulations, orders, decrees, writs, judgments, awards, injunctions,
and the like, as I have deemed necessary as a basis for the opinions
hereinafter expressed.

     In my examination of the documents referred to above, I have assumed the
authenticity of all such documents submitted to me as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures (other than signatures of the U.S. Borrowers),
and the conformity to the originals of such documents submitted to me as
copies.  I have relied, as to factual matters, on the documents I have
examined.  I also have assumed that the Lenders, the Arrangers and the Agents
each has duly executed and delivered, pursuant to due authorization, the
Credit Agreement.

     Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed
necessary, I am of the opinion that:

     (a)  Each of the U.S. Borrowers is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation in
all jurisdictions where the nature of its properties or business so requires,
except for jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify would not have a
material adverse effect on such Borrower or its business.

     (b)  The execution, delivery and performance by each U.S. Borrower of the
Credit Agreement and such Borrower's Notes are within such Borrower's
corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
and do not contravene (i) its Charter or By-Laws, (ii) any law, rule or
regulation or, to the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, any order,
decree, writ, judgment, award, injunction or similar legal restriction
applicable to  such Borrower, or (iii) to the best of my knowledge after due
inquiry, any contractual restriction contained in any indenture, loan or
credit agreement, guaranty, mortgage, deed of trust, bond, note, or other
agreement or instrument which binds or affects or purports to bind or affect
such Borrower.  The Credit Agreement and each U.S. Borrower's Notes have been
duly executed and delivered by such Borrower.

     (c)  No authorization or approval or other action by, and no notice to or
filing with, any governmental authority or regulatory body is required for the
due execution, delivery and performance by any U.S. Borrower of the Credit
Agreement or such Borrower's Notes (other than those which have been duly
obtained or made and are in full force and effect).

     (d)  The Credit Agreement and each Borrower's Notes are the legal, valid
and binding obligations of such Borrower enforceable against such Borrower in
accordance with their respective terms.

     (e)  There is no pending or, to the best of my knowledge after due
inquiry, threatened action or proceeding affecting either U.S. Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator, which
would be likely to have a material adverse effect on such Borrower's ability
to perform its obligations under the Credit Agreement or such Borrower's Notes
or which is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against
such Borrower of the Credit Agreement or such Borrower's Notes.

     (f)  No Borrower is (i) an "investment company" as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940 or (ii) to the best of my knowledge after due
inquiry, engaged in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulation U issued
by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) except in compliance
with all Regulations issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, including, without limitation, Regulations G, T, U and X thereof.

My opinions above are subject to the following qualifications:

     (a)  My opinion is subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

     (b)  I express no opinion as to Section 10.10(b) of the Credit Agreement
insofar as it relates to an action brought in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York and note that such matters may be raised
by such court.

     (c)  I express no opinion as to any indemnification obligations of the
Borrowers under the Credit Agreement to the extent such obligations might be
deemed to be inconsistent with public policy.

     (d)  I express no opinion as to the provisions of Section 10.09(f) of the
Credit Agreement purporting to grant a right of setoff to Participants.

     (e)  I express no opinion as to any provision of the Credit Agreement
that purports to establish an evidentiary standard for determination by the
Lenders or the Agents.

     (f)  I am qualified to practice law in the State of New York and do not
purport to be an expert on, or to express any opinion herein concerning, any
law other than the law of the State of New York, the general corporate law of
the State of Delaware and the Federal law of the United States. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, I express no opinion as to the
effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York wherein
any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of the Credit Agreement or
the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of interest legally chargeable
or collectible.

                                       Very truly yours,











                                                                   EXHIBIT E-2

                    OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR THE OVERSEAS BORROWERS


[                                                              Effective Date]

To the Lenders and Agents
parties to the Credit Agreement
referred to below

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is furnished to you pursuant to Section 3.01(d) of the Revolving
Credit Agreement, dated as of October 22, 1997 (the "Credit Agreement"), among
Xerox Corporation ("Xerox"), Xerox Credit Corporation ("XCC"), Xerox Overseas
Holdings PLC ("Xerox Overseas") and Rank Xerox Capital (Europe) PLC ("Xerox
Capital (Europe)"), and, together with Xerox Overseas, (the "Overseas
Borrowers").  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are used herein as therein
defined.

I am the Company Secretary of Rank Xerox Limited, a private limited company
incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and a Barrister in England
and have acted as English legal adviser to the Overseas Borrowers in
connection with the preparation, execution and delivery of the Credit
Agreement and the Notes of each such Borrower delivered on the date hereof.

In that connection, I have examined:

(a)  The Credit Agreement;

(b)  The Notes of the Overseas Borrowers delivered on the date hereof;

(c)  The documents furnished pursuant to Section 3.01(b) and (c) of the
Credit Agreement, which include the following:

     (i)   certified copies of the resolutions of the Board of Directors of
each Overseas Borrower approving the Credit Agreement and the Notes of such
Overseas Borrower;

     (ii)  signed copies of a certificate of the Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary of each Overseas Borrower, certifying the names and true signatures
of specimens thereof of the officers of such Overseas Borrower who are
authorised, on behalf of such Overseas Borrower, to sign the Credit Agreement,
the Notes of such Overseas Borrower and the other documents to be delivered by
such Overseas Borrower under the Credit Agreement.

In my examination of the documents referred to above, I have assumed the
authenticity of all such documents submitted to me as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures (other than signatures of the Overseas
Borrowers), and the conformity to the originals of such documents submitted to
me as copies.  I have relied, as to factual matters, on the documents I have
examined.  I also have assumed that the Lenders, the Arrangers and the Agents
each has duly executed and delivered, pursuant to due authorization, the
Credit Agreement.

This opinion is limited to English law as presently applied by the English
courts and is given on the basis that it will be governed by and construed in
accordance with English law.  I have made no investigation of the laws of any
jurisdiction other than England and neither express nor imply any opinion as
to any other laws and in particular the laws of the State of New York and the
United States of America.

Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as I have deemed
necessary, I am of the opinion that:

(a)  Each of the Overseas Borrowers is a corporation duly incorporated and
validly existing under the laws of England and Wales and has all requisite
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the
Credit Agreement and such Overseas Borrower's Notes.

(b)  The execution, delivery and performance by each Overseas Borrower of the
Credit Agreement and such Overseas Borrower's Notes are within such Overseas
Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, and do not contravene (i) its Memorandum or Articles, (ii)
any United Kingdom law, rule or regulation or, to the best of my knowledge
after due inquiry, any order, decree, writ, judgment, award, injunction or
similar legal restriction applicable to such Overseas Borrower, or (iii) to
the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, any contractual restriction
contained in any indenture, loan or credit agreement, guaranty, mortgage, deed
of trust, bond, note or other agreement or instrument which binds or affects
or purports to bind or affect such Overseas Borrower.

(c)  The express choice of the laws of the State of New York to govern the
Credit Agreement and the Overseas Borrowers' Notes will be recognized and
upheld by an English court, but such choice of law will not displace
mandatory rules of law applicable in another jurisdiction with which the
relevant transaction is otherwise solely connected or in which any dispute
with respect to the aforesaid agreements is being adjudicated.  To the extent
that such mandatory rules affect any part of the transaction, an English court
is likely to restrict the application of those rules to the relevant part of
the transaction and to treat the laws of the State of New York as applicable
to the remainder.

(d)  The Credit Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
each Overseas Borrower and (assuming the due authorisation, execution and
delivery thereof by the other parties thereto and subject to the Credit
Agreement being in a proper legal form under the laws of the State of New
York) constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of such Overseas
Borrower, enforceable against such Overseas Borrower in accordance with its
terms.

(e)  The Notes of each Overseas Borrower have been duly authorized and, when
the Notes are issued and delivered as provided the Credit Agreement, will be
duly and validly issued and delivered and (subject to their being in a proper
legal form under the laws of the State of New York) will constitute legal,
valid and binding obligations of such Overseas Borrower enforceable against
such Overseas Borrower in accordance with their terms.

The expression "enforceable" as used in paragraphs (d) and (e) above means
that the obligations of each Overseas Borrower created by the Credit Agreement
and such Overseas Borrower's Notes are of a type which English courts enforce.
It does not mean that those obligations will necessarily be enforced in all
circumstances in accordance with their terms.  In particular (without
limitation):

     (i)   enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
liquidation, reorganisation and other laws or principles of equity or public
policy from time to time in force, in each case affecting the rights of
creditors generally;

     (ii)  the power of a court to order certain equitable remedies, such as
an injunction or specific performance, is discretionary and an English court
may in its discretion make an award of damages where this is considered an
adequate remedy;

     (iii) enforcement of obligations may become time barred by statute or
may be or become subject to defenses of set-off or counter-claim depending on
the circumstances;

     (iv)  where obligations are to be performed or observed in jurisdictions
outside England and Wales, or by a person subject to the laws of a
jurisdiction outside England and Wales, they may not be enforceable under
English law to the extent that performance or observance would be illegal or
contrary to public policy under the laws of any such jurisdiction or by virtue
of any international treaty to which England is a party; and

     (v)   any person who is not a party to an agreement may not be able to
enforce any provisions of that agreement which are expressed to be for the
benefit of that person.

(f)  As of the Effective Date, there are no United Kingdom Taxes which are
imposed on any payment to be made by Xerox Capital (Europe) or Xerox Overseas
pursuant to this Agreement or its Notes, or are imposed by virtue of the
execution, delivery or enforcement of this Agreement or its Notes; provided
that withholding taxes will be imposed on payments of interest to a Lender in
respect of an Advance unless (i) such Lender is a bank within the meaning of
that expression in s.840A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 of the
United Kingdom and such Advance is made through, and effectively connected
with, such Lender's Applicable Lending Office in the United Kingdom such that
the Lender is within the charge to United Kingdom Corporation Tax with respect
to such interest and its Note of the relevant Overseas Borrower evidencing
such Advance is not assigned, negotiated or otherwise transferred to a Person
outside the United Kingdom or to any other Person who is not within the charge
to United Kingdom Corporation Act with respect to such interest, (ii) the term
of such Advance is for an Interest Period (which term shall include all
extensions and successive renewals of such Advance upon expiry of an Interest
Period for such Advance) of 364 days or less or (iii) such Lender is resident
in a country with which the United Kingdom has a double tax treaty and the
United Kingdom Inland Revenue has issued a direction in writing to the
relevant Overseas Borrower to pay interest on such Advance gross to such
Lender pursuant to an exemption from United Kingdom Tax on such interest to
which such Lender is entitled under such treaty.  As used in the foregoing
clause (iii), the term "Lender" refers to the beneficial owner of the interest
on the Advance in question.

Very truly yours

                        OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL TO AGENTS


                                                              [Effective Date]


To the Lenders and Agents
parties to the Credit Agreement
referred to below

Gentlemen:

     We have acted as special counsel to the Agents party to the Credit
Agreement referred to below in connection with the preparation, execution and
delivery of the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October 22, 1997 (the
"Credit Agreement"), among Xerox Corporation ("Xerox"), Xerox Credit
Corporation ("XCC"), Xerox Overseas Holdings PLC and Rank Xerox Capital
(Europe) PLC, (the "Overseas Borrowers" and, together with Xerox and XCC,
collectively the "Borrowers"), the Lenders party thereto and the Arrangers and
Agents named therein.  Capitalized terms are used herein as defined in the
Credit Agreement.

     In that connection we have examined the following documents:

     (a)  A counterpart of the Credit Agreement, executed by each of the
Borrowers; and

     (b)  The documents furnished by the Borrowers, as appropriate pursuant to
Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement and listed on Annex A hereto, including
the opinion of Martin S. Wagner, Associate General Counsel, Corporate, Finance
and Ventures of Xerox Corporation, counsel for the Borrowers and the opinion
of Carole Shephard, legal adviser to the Overseas Borrowers.

     In our examination of the documents referred to above, we have assumed
the authenticity of all such documents submitted to us as originals, the
genuineness of all signatures, the due authority of the parties executing such
documents and the conformity to the originals of such documents submitted to
us as copies.  We have relied, as to factual matters, on the documents we have
examined.  We also have assumed that each of the Lenders, each of the
Arrangers and each of the Agents has duly executed and delivered, pursuant to
due authorization, the Credit Agreement, that each of the Agents, each of the
Arrangers and each of the Lenders is duly organized and validly existing in
good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization and each of
the Lenders is duly licensed to make loans from its office indicated on the
signature pages to the Credit Agreement and that each of the Agents, each of
the Arrangers and each of the Lenders has full power, authority and legal
right to make and perform the Credit Agreement.

     To the extent that our opinion expressed below involves conclusions as to
the matters set forth in paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (f) of the above-mentioned
opinion of Martin S. Wagner and in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of the above-
mentioned opinion of Carole Shephard, we have assumed without independent
investigation the correctness of the opinions set forth in such paragraphs.
Based upon the foregoing and upon such investigation as we have deemed
necessary, we are of the opinion that:

     (a)  The Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Article 9
thereof) is a legal, valid and binding agreement of each Borrower (including,
without limitation, Xerox in its capacity as guarantor under Article 9) and
the Notes delivered by each Borrower today are legal, valid and binding
obligations of such Borrower, in each case enforceable against such Borrower
in accordance with their respective terms.

     (b)  The opinion of Martin S. Wagner, counsel for the Borrowers, the
opinion of Carole Shephard, legal adviser to the Overseas Borrowers, and the
other documents referred to in item (b) above are substantially responsive to
the requirements of the Credit Agreement.

     Our opinion in paragraph (a) above is subject to the following
qualifications:

     (i)   The enforceability of each Borrower's obligations under the Credit
Agreement and such Borrower's Notes is subject to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

     (ii)  The enforceability of each Borrower's obligations under the Credit
Agreement and such Borrower's Notes is also subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance,
moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally.

     (iii) We are qualified to practice law in the State of New York and
do not purport to be experts on, or to express any opinion herein concerning,
any law other than the law of the State of New York and the federal law of the
United States.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we express
no opinion as to the effect of the law of any jurisdiction other than the
State of New York wherein any Lender may be located or wherein enforcement of
the Credit Agreement or the Notes may be sought which limits the rates of
interest legally chargeable or collectible.

Very truly yours,

Dated             ,

     Reference is made to the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of October

                 CALCULATION OF MLA COST FOR LIBOR COMPETITIVE
               ADVANCES AND SWINGLINE ADVANCES IN POUNDS STERLING


Any additional interest to be paid to a Lender pursuant to Section 2.11(b)

shall accrue at a rate per annum equal to such Lender's MLA Cost calculated on
the basis of the following formula:


MLA Cost  =  BY + L(Y-X) + S(Y-Z)
                 100 - (B+S)


(a)  Where on the day of application of the formula:

     B     is the percentage of the Lender's eligible liabilities which the
           Bank of England requires the Lender to hold in a non-interest
           bearing deposit account with the Bank of England in accordance with
           its cash ratio requirements;

     Y     is the rate at which Sterling deposits in an amount approximately
           equal to the principal amount of the relevant Advance are offered
           by the Lender to leading banks in the London interbank market at or
           about 11:00 a.m. (London time), on that day for the Relevant Period
           (as defined below);

     L     is the percentage of eligible liabilities which the Bank of England
           requires such Lender to maintain as secured money with members of
           the London Discount Market Association and/or as secured call money
           with those money brokers and gilt-edged market makers recognized by
           the Bank of England;

     X     is the rate at which secured Sterling deposits in the relevant
           amount may be placed by the Lender with members of the London
           Discount Market Association and/or as secured call money with money
           brokers and gilt-edged market makers at or about 11:00 a.m. (London
           time) on that day for the Relevant Period;

     S     is the percentage of the Lender's eligible liabilities which the
           Bank of England requires the Lender to place as a special deposit
           with the Bank of England; and

     Z     is the interest rate per annum allowed by the Bank of England on
           special deposits.

(b)  For the purposes of this Exhibit H:

     "eligible liabilities" and "special deposits" have the meanings given to
them at the time of application of the formula by the Bank of England;

         (i)  "Relevant Period" means:

              (A)  if the relevant Interest Period is 3 months or less, such
         Interest Period; or

              (B)  if the relevant Interest Period is more than 3 months, each
         consecutive period of 3 months within such Interest Period and any
         balance of such Interest Period.

(c)  In the application of the formula B, Y, L, X, S and Z are included in the
formula as figures and not as percentages, e.g. if B = 0.5% and Y = 15%, BY is
calculated as 0.5 x 15.

(d)  The formula is applied on the first day of each Relevant Period.

(e)  The rate calculated in accordance with the formula is, if necessary,
rounded upward to four decimal places.

(f)  Calculations with be made on the basis of a year of 365 days and the
actual number of days elapsed.

(g)  If a change in circumstances (including the imposition of alternative or
additional official requirements, other than capital adequacy requirements)
renders the formula inappropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Lender, the
Lender shall notify the Borrowers of the manner in which its MLA Cost will
subsequently be calculated (which manner shall be determined reasonably and in
good faith).  The manner of calculation so notified by the Lender shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be binding on all the parties.










                                                                    EXHIBIT I

                   OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR AN OVERSEAS  BORROWER


                                            [Dated as provided in Section 3.03
                                             of the Credit Agreement]


To the Lenders and Agents
parties to the Credit Agreement
referred to below

Dear Sirs:

     I am counsel to [name of Overseas Borrower], a [jurisdiction of
incorporation] corporation (the "Overseas Borrower") and give this opinion
pursuant to Section 3.03(b) of the Revolving Credit Agreement (the "Credit
Agreement") dated as of October 22, 1997 among Xerox Corporation ("Xerox"),
the Overseas Borrowers party thereto, the Lenders party thereto and the
Arrangers and Agents named therein.  Terms defined in the Credit Agreement are
used herein as therein defined.

     I have examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified
to my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records, certificates of
public officials and other instruments and have conducted such other
investigations of fact and law as I have deemed necessary or advisable for
purposes of this opinion.

     Upon the basis of the foregoing, I am of the opinion that:

     (a)  The Overseas Borrower is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of [jurisdiction of
incorporation], and is a Wholly-Owned Overseas Subsidiary of Xerox.

     (b)  The execution and delivery by the Overseas Borrower of its
Election to Participate and its Notes and the performance by the Overseas
Borrower of the Credit Agreement and its Notes are within the Overseas
Borrower's corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or constitute a
default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Borrower or of any agreement,
judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the
Overseas Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Overseas Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries.

     (c)  The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
the Overseas Borrower and its Notes constitute valid and binding obligations
of the Overseas Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity.

     (d)  Except as disclosed in the Overseas Borrower's Election to
Participate, there is, as of the date hereof, no Tax of [jurisdiction of
incorporation and, if different, principal place of business], or any taxing
authority thereof or therein, imposed by or in the nature of withholding or
otherwise, which is imposed on any payment to be made by the Overseas
Borrower, to any Lender that is a party to the Credit Agreement on the date
hereof, pursuant to the Credit Agreement or the Overseas Borrower's Notes, or
is imposed by virtue of the execution, delivery or enforcement of its Election
to Participate, the Credit Agreement or its Notes.

                                    Very truly yours,

Ratio of earnings to
   fixed charges (1)(2)    *     3.14    2.98    1.80    3.64    3.71    3.54

(1) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges has been computed based on the
    Company's continuing operations by dividing total earnings available for
    fixed charges, excluding capitalized interest and preferred stock
    dividends of subsidiaries, by total fixed charges.  Fixed charges consist
    of interest, including capitalized interest and preferred stock dividends
    of subsidiaries, and one-third of rent expense as representative of the
    interest portion of rentals.

(2) The Company's ratio of earnings to fixed charges includes the effect of
    the Company's finance subsidiaries, which primarily finance Xerox
    equipment.  Financing businesses are more highly leveraged and,
    therefore, tend to operate at lower earnings to fixed charges ratio
    levels than do non-financial businesses.

*   Earnings for the nine months of 2000 were inadequate to cover fixed
    charges.  The coverage deficiency was $395 million. Excluding charges
    for special items - the 2000 restructuring, CPID in-process R&D charge
    and Mexico provision -  the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would be
    1.48.

**  Excluding the effects of the charges recorded in connection with the 1998
    restructuring plan, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges would be 3.55.

*** Sum of "Income (Loss) before Income Taxes (Benefits), Equity Income and
    Minorities' Interests" and "Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated
    Affiliates."
